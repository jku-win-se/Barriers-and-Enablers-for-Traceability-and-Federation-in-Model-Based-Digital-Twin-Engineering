Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period.","Building Information Model (BIM), Energy saving, Green Building, Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast), {eid: 84855440065}>, <None, {eid: 78649784171}>, <Re (De) fining Net Zero Energy: Renewable Emergy Balance in environmental building design, {eid: 80052798303}>, <Case study of zero energy house design in UK, {eid: 69249208690}>, <None, {eid: 84858075740}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework, {eid: 84858071872}>, <Getting to net zero, {eid: 70349634940}>, <None, {eid: 79957854089}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies, {eid: 79951517816}>, <Net Zero Energy Homes of the Future: A Case Study of the écoTerraTM House in Canada, {eid: 79951510163}>, <Goal zero energy building-Exemplary experience based on the solar estate Solarsiedlung Freiburg am Schlierberg, {eid: 85059350562}>, <Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings: An Overview and Analysis onWorldwide Building Projects, {eid: 79955146310}>, <Check and evaluation system on heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of china based on multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, {eid: 64749088443}>, <None, {eid: 82055194442}>, <Renewable Substitutability Index: Maximizing Renewable Resource Use in Building, {eid: 84958761582}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status, {eid: 84886457808}>, <Evaluation of net-zero energy residential buildings in the MENA region, {eid: 84961784216}>, <None, {eid: 78349265716}>, <None, {eid: 85059349047}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition Preprint, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings, {eid: 84869864963}>, <None, {eid: 2242442162}>, <A CAD-based Approach to Embodied Energy Impact Modelling for Housing Design, {eid: 31044437419}>, <None, {eid: 31044449208}>, <Capital Energy Costs of Building and Recycling of Building Materials, {eid: 85059341810}>, <None, {eid: 85059348486}>, <None, {eid: 85059341528}>, <None, {eid: 85059345027}>, <Life cycle cost and energy analysis of a Net Zero Energy House with solar combisystem, {eid: 77957315695}>, <From net energy to zero energy buildings: Defining life cycle zero energy buildings (LC-ZEB), {eid: 77950299775}>, <How to define nearly net zero energy buildings nZEB, {eid: 84858075626}>, <A through-life evaluation of end-of-life rolling stocks considering asset recycling, energy recovering, and financial benefit, {eid: 85059297387}>, <Designing net-zero energy buildings for the future climate, not for the past, {eid: 84860435670}>, <None, {eid: 85059349691}>, <On-site or off-site renewable energy supply options?

Some of this research is helping to solve humankind’s most pressing problems. However, as this provocation argues, up to 50% of the articles that are now being published in many interdisciplinary sustainability and transitions journals may be categorized as “scholarly bullshit.” These are articles that typically engage with the latest sustainability and transitions buzzword (e.g., circular economy), while contributing little to none to the scholarly body of knowledge on the topic. A typology of “scholarly bullshit” is proposed which includes the following archetypes: boring question scholarship, literature review of literature reviews, recycled research, master thesis madness, and activist rants. Since “scholarly bullshit” articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors. Citations matter most in the metric-driven logic of the academic system, and this type of scholarship, sadly, is thus unlikely to decrease in the coming years.","Circular economy, Scholarly bullshit, Sustainability, Sustainability transitions, Sustainable development, Theory of bullshit",,,,,,,,"<On bullshit, {eid: 3042610478}>, <None, {eid: 27744471870, doi: 10.1515/9781400826537}>, <None, {eid: 85053410623}>, <Conceptualizing the circular economy: an analysis of 114 definitions, {eid: 85029397642, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005}>",,,Springer Nature,,,3/1/2023,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85171300560

This paper presents a compact review about digital twins for PED from aspects of concepts, working principles, tools/platforms, and applications, in order to address the issues of both how a digital PED twin is made and what tools can be used for a digital PED twin. Four key components of digital PED twin are identified, i.e., a virtual model, sensor network integration, data analytics, and a stakeholder layer. Very few available tools now have full functions for digital PED twin, while most tools either have a focus on industrial applications or are designed for data collection, communication and visualization based on building information models (BIM) or geographical information system (GIS). Several observations gained from successful application are that current digital PED twins can be categorized into three tiers: (1) an enhanced version of BIM model only, (2) semantic platforms for data flow, and (3) big data analysis and feedback operation. Further challenges and opportunities are found in areas of data analysis and semantic interoperability, business models, data security, and management. The outcome of the review is expected to provide useful information for further development of digital PED twins and optimizing its sustainability.","application, digital twin, positive energy district, review, simulation tool",,,,,,,,"<Data security, privacy, availability and integrity in cloud computing: issues and current solutions, {eid: 85019206410, doi: 10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070464}>, <SPHERE: BIM digital twin platform, {eid: 85081081915, doi: 10.3390/proceedings2019020009}>, <A survey on data confidentiality and privacy in cloud computing, {eid: 85030468877, doi: 10.1145/3102304.3102314}>, <Modeling of data security in cloud computing, {eid: 84979238831, doi: 10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490658}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <None, {eid: 85123065556}>, <Data security and privacy protection issues in cloud computing, {eid: 84861072527, doi: 10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.193}>, <None, {eid: 85123086519}>, <None, {eid: 85123062640}>, <None, {eid: 85123103896}>, <None, {eid: 85123110758}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <An approach to data acquisition for urban building energy modeling using a gaussian mixture model and expectation-maximization algorithm, {eid: 85099990916, doi: 10.3390/buildings11010030}>, <None, {eid: 85123082674}>, <Towards the next generation of smart grids: semantic and holonic multiagent management of distributed energy resources, {eid: 85017566936, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.107}>, <None, {eid: 85123104373}>, <None, {eid: 85123078152}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 84968669593}>, <Fair P2P energy trading between residential and commercial multi-energy systems enabling integrated demand-side management, {eid: 85078962304, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114551}>, <Digital twin: vision, benefits, boundaries, and creation for buildings, {eid: 85077738936, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946515}>, <None, {eid: 85077118399, doi: 10.1145/3359997.3365734}>, <None, {eid: 85104498118}>, <None, {eid: 85123074391}>, <None, {eid: 85123064251}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <None, {eid: 85111421396}>, <None, {eid: 85123088972}>, <None, {eid: 85123086618}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85074335396, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.10.001}>, <Selection of energy performance contracting business models: a behavioral decision-making approach, {eid: 85009468569, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.058}>, <Data security challenges and its solutions in cloud computing, {eid: 84938915179, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.171}>, <None, {eid: 85123081657}>, <Business model innovation for sustainable energy: German utilities and renewable energy, {eid: 84884983829, doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.038}>, <A comparison of arrangements for increasing self-consumption and maximising the value of distributed photovoltaics on apartment buildings, {eid: 85072750095, doi: 10.1016/j.solener.2019.09.067}>, <None, {eid: 85082387061}>, <None, {eid: 85085171158}>, <None, {eid: 85097752653}>, <None, {eid: 85123092752}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 85112079295}>, <None, {eid: 85123092089}>, <None, {eid: 85123091342}>, <Peer-to-peer energy trading in a microgrid, {eid: 85044466952, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.010}>",,,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,6/21/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85115005557

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future.","BIM, Digital twin, Existing building, Net Zero Energy Building, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2017, {eid: 84894378197}>, <Towards Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings Definition of Common Principles under the EPBD-Final Report, {eid: 84906815954}>, <A Digital-Twin Evaluation of Net Zero Energy Building for Existing Buildings., {eid: 85059346336}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework., {eid: 84858071872}>, <Energy efficient design of building: A review., {eid: 84860223899}>, <Design of a Sustainable Building: A Conceptual Framework for Implementing Sustainability in the Building Sector., {eid: 85077711816}>, <Energy and Sustainable Strategies in the renovation of existing buildings: An Italian Case Study., {eid: 85197038195}>, <Integrated life cycle assessment and thermodynamic simulation of a public buildings envelope renovation: Conventional vs. Passivhaus proposal, {eid: 85040317509}>, <Regenerative Design of Existing Buildings for Net-Zero Energy Use., {eid: 84948443104}>, <Optical and thermal characterization of multiple glazed windows with low U-values., {eid: 0028413030}>, <Annual thermal evaluation of a double pane window using glazing available in the Mexican market., {eid: 85050146968}>, <Thermal analysis of triple and quadruple windows using partitioning radiant energy veils? with different physical and optical properties, {eid: 85055081957}>, <None, {eid: 85082943441}>, <None, {eid: 85082946648}>, <None, {eid: 85082929946}>, <None, {eid: 85082969997}>, <None, {eid: 85082946095}>, <None, {eid: 85082962564}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies., {eid: 79951517816}>, <Integration of renewable energy technology in building., {eid: 80055005162}>, <Integrating renewable energy technologies to support building trigeneration-A multi-criteria analysis., {eid: 84155166959}>, <Comprehensive use of renewable energy in building., {eid: 84884810513}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status., {eid: 84886457808}>, <None, {eid: 85082974517}>, <None, {eid: 85082946262}>, <None, {eid: 85082963190}>, <None, {eid: 85082953929}>, <None, {eid: 85082975916}>, <Control system and energy saving potential for switchable windows, {eid: 0011876305}>, <None, {eid: 85082974334}>, <None, {eid: 85082965652}>, <None, {eid: 85082958499}>, <None, {eid: 85082943998}>, <None, {eid: 85082962096}>, <None, {eid: 85082975572}>, <None, {eid: 85082926162}>, <Thermal properties optimization of envelope in energy-saving renovation of existing public buildings., {eid: 84896530062}>, <None, {eid: 85082925511}>, <None, {eid: 85082922233}>, <None, {eid: 85082932259}>, <None, {eid: 85082961571}>, <None, {eid: 85082974641}>, <None, {eid: 85082933534}>, <None, {eid: 85082927574}>, <None, {eid: 85082942378}>, <Grand challenges in transportation and transit systems., {eid: 84997615254}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85082879525

In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms to learn, reason, and build the 'digital twin' of a patient. Computational models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and enabling the vision of precision medicine.","Artificial intelligence, Computational modelling, Digital twin, Precision medicine",,,,,,,,"<Precision medicine in cardiology, {eid: 84976448008}>, <From genetics to smart watches: developments in precision cardiology, {eid: 85058940139}>, <A new initiative on precision medicine, {eid: 84923762812}>, <Promises, promises, and precision medicine, {eid: 85062423215}>, <Precision medicine vs preventive medicine, {eid: 85060593774}>, <Evolution beyond neo-Darwinism: a new conceptual framework, {eid: 84924264935}>, <Integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling-perspectives, challenges, and opportunities in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences, {eid: 85135599036}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Teaching cardiovascular medicine to machines, {eid: 85050918165}>, <Length-dependent tension in the failing heart and the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 78751507006}>, <Differentiating electromechanical from non-electrical substrates of mechanical discoordination to identify responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 84955475978}>, <SMOD - Data Augmentation Based on Statistical Models of Deformation to Enhance Segmentation in 2D Cine Cardiac MRI, {eid: 85067176547, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-21949-9-39}>, <Machine-learning integration of complex echocardiographic patterns and clinical parameters from cohorts and trials, {eid: 85092288720, doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz745.0147}>, <Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?, {eid: 85047537837}>, <Big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care: promise and challenges, {eid: 84961393205}>, <Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular imaging: JACC state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85062806342}>, <Computational models in cardiology, {eid: 85055544890}>, <Enabling precision cardiology through multiscale biology and systems medicine, {eid: 85033597806}>, <Recent developments in using mechanistic cardiac modelling for drug safety evaluation, {eid: 84959289711}>, <None, {eid: 0004110543}>, <Computational modelling of 1D blood flow with variable mechanical properties and its application to the simulation of wave propagation in the human arterial system, {eid: 0242497983}>, <Random forest for automatic assessment of heart failure severity in a telemonitoring scenario, {eid: 84886524376}>, <Gaussian process robust regression for noisy heart rate data, {eid: 50049125217}>, <Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics, {eid: 85048201970}>, <Patient-specific computer modeling to predict aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, {eid: 84959872264}>, <Patient-specific cardiovascular computational modeling: diversity of personalization and challenges, {eid: 85049612985}>, <The role of computational modeling and simulation in the total product life cycle of peripheral vascular devices, {eid: 85018379109}>, <Multi-modality image-based computational analysis of haemodynamics in aortic dissection, {eid: 84944603147}>, <""Virtual"" (computed) fractional flow reserve, {eid: 84937739100}>, <The estimation of patient-specific cardiac diastolic functions from clinical measurements, {eid: 84883865079}>, <Left ventricular diastolic myocardial stiffness and end-diastolic myofibre stress in human heart failure using personalised biomechanical analysis, {eid: 85049665722}>, <A finite-element approach to the direct computation of relative cardiovascular pressure from time-resolved MR velocity data, {eid: 84861976269}>, <Non-invasive pressure difference estimation from PC-MRI using the work-energy equation, {eid: 84942257432}>, <Beyond Bernoulli: improving the accuracy and precision of non-invasive estimation of peak pressure drops, {eid: 85009860323}>, <Diagnostic performance of noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography in suspected coronary artery disease, {eid: 84896972430}>, <Noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CT angiography, {eid: 84944041048}>, <Non-invasive fractional flow reserve using computed tomographic angiography: where are we now and where are we going?, {eid: 85024487439}>, <Advancing regulatory science with computational modeling for medical devices at the FDAs Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories, {eid: 85062702939, doi: 10.3389/fmed.2018.00241}>, <Noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms: a feasibility report noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms.
