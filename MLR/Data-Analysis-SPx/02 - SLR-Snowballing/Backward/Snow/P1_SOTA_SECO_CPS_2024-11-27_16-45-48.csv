This does not only apply to systems, but also to engineering itself with its processes, methodologies and tools. On the one hand, approaches like Model-Based Systems Engineering or virtual verification and validation demonstrate that digitalization has the effect of demanding computer-interpretable and continuous sets of information. On the other hand, the approaches themselves require new functionalities regarding the engineering IT and thus raise new requirements. This paper presents a systematic approach to identify and analyze the requirements towards an engineering IT architecture. The approach is model-based and comes with modeling guidance and a meta-model to support the analysis.","Analysis, Engineering IT, Enterprise Architecture, MBSE, Requirements",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84903620173}>, <Der Weg zu Intelli-genten Technischen Systemen, {eid: 84941275700}>, <None, {eid: 85015931629}>, <None, {eid: 84954540930}>, <None, {eid: 4444332989}>, <None, {eid: 85089974918}>, <None, {eid: 0342925129}>, <None, {eid: 18544389830}>, <Fundamentals of agile systems engineering-part 1, {eid: 85171628974}>, <Model lifecycle management for mbse, {eid: 85105924917}>, <Seamless simulation toolchain for virtual engineering and virtual commissioning of smart factories, {eid: 85068455094}>, <System lifecycle management-An approach for developing cybertronic systems in consideration of sustainability aspects, {eid: 85020033295}>, <Digitalisierung-Definition und Reife, {eid: 85040764518}>, <None, {eid: 85050962618}>, <Die Digitalisierung der Wertschöfpfung kommt in deutschen Unternehmen an: Industrie 4.0 wird unsere Arbeit verändern, {eid: 85019106287}>, <None, {eid: 67651225281}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <An application framework of digital twin and its case study, {eid: 85049576881}>, <Digital twin-the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <None, {eid: 85076727929}>, <None, {eid: 0003677281}>, <Process models in design and development, {eid: 85023196132}>, <Enterprise architecture management-state of research analysis & a comparison of selected approaches, {eid: 84892640455}>, <Model-based process engineering-An approach to integrated product system and process modelling, {eid: 85081080532}>, <An integrated product-process-organisation model to manage design system, {eid: 51749107686}>, <Grai engineering methodology for design performance improvement, {eid: 34648868772}>, <None, {eid: 33744808421}>, <None, {eid: 77949517037}>, <None, {eid: 85081085504}>, <None, {eid: 85081093818}>, <None, {eid: 0009246831}>, <Systems engineering a model based systems engineering tool suite: The boeing approach, {eid: 85170258617}>, <An explanatory model as basis for the introduction of systems engineering and capable it-infrastructures in industry, {eid: 85081079092}>, <The levels of conceptual interoperability model, {eid: 10244265492}>, <Process for the development of a digital strategy, {eid: 85081080802}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081091712

We aim at identifying industrial and academic tools for cross-domain model management and describing the inconsistency types addressed by them as well as strategies the users of the tools employ to keep consistency between models of different domains. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review. Using the keyword-based search on Google Scholar we analyzed 515 potentially relevant studies; after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 88 papers were selected for further analysis. Results: The main findings/contributions are: (i) a list of available tools used to support model management; (ii) approximately 31% of the tools can provide consistency model checking on models of different domains and approximately 24% on the same domain; (iii) available strategies to keep the consistency between models of different domains are not mature enough; (iv) explicit modeling dependencies between models is not common in the industry. However, it is considered as a requirement by academia if one wishes to manage inconsistency between models of different domains. Conclusion: This study presents an overview of industrial practices and academic approaches about the cross-domain model management. The results presented in this study can be used as a starting point for future research on model management topics, and also for further improvement of actual model management tools.","Model

In this context, one of the most mature and popular standards for distributed simulation is the IEEE 1516-2010 - Standard for M&S high level architecture (HLA). However, building and maintaining distributed simulations components, based on the IEEE 1516-2010 standard, is still a challenging and effort-consuming task. To ease the development of full-fledged HLA-based simulations, the paper proposes the MONADS method (MOdel-driveN Architecture for Distributed Simulation), which relies on the model-driven systems engineering paradigm. The method takes as input system models specified in Systems Modeling Language, the reference modeling language in the systems engineering field, and produces as output the final code of the corresponding HLA-based distributed simulation through a chain of model-to-model and model-to-text transformations. The obtained simulation code is based on the HLA Development Kit software framework, which has been developed by the SMASH-Lab (System Modeling and Simulation Hub - Laboratory) of the University of Calabria (Italy), in cooperation with the Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division (ER) of NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston (TX, USA). The effectiveness of the method is shown through a case study that concerns a military patrol operation, in which a set of drones are engaged to patrol the border of a military area, in order to prevent both ground and flight attacks from entering the area.","distributed simulation, high-level architecture, model-based systems engineering, Modeling and simulation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85015825160}>, <None, {eid: 0003484946}>, <None, {eid: 85062360065}>, <None, {eid: 0003520342}>, <Model-driven development: a metamodeling foundation, {eid: 0141725648}>, <None, {eid: 85062351479}>, <None, {eid: 85044522897}>, <None, {eid: 85062323150}>, <None, {eid: 85049162689}>, <None, {eid: 85062345059}>, <None, {eid: 85062321868}>, <None, {eid: 85062346248}>, <None, {eid: 84985918527}>, <None, {eid: 84886142038}>, <Experiences in simplifying distributed simulation: the HLA development kit framework, {eid: 85026362781}>, <None, {eid: 85042916879}>, <None, {eid: 85044517342}>, <None, {eid: 85062339476}>, <None, {eid: 84858067801}>, <None, {eid: 84913601159}>, <None, {eid: 85002637160}>, <None, {eid: 84863274017}>, <None, {eid: 85010369493}>, <None, {eid: 85062341637}>, <None, {eid: 85062328039}>, <None, {eid: 85062348177}>, <None, {eid: 77954677566}>, <None, {eid: 84867729868}>, <None, {eid: 84894110082}>, <None, {eid: 80052596859}>, <None, {eid: 85133430852}>, <None, {eid: 60749123345}>, <Building a high-level architecture federated interoperable framework from legacy information systems, {eid: 84897663056}>, <None, {eid: 85026345450}>, <None, {eid: 84894110082}>, <None, {eid: 85062329779}>, <None, {eid: 84969805541}>, <None, {eid: 84857747433}>, <A metamodel for federation architectures, {eid: 48249139060}>, <Model-based code generation for HLA federates, {eid: 76949099611}>, <Layered simulation architecture: a practical approach, {eid: 84872105223}>, <Avoiding another green elephant - a proposal for the next generation HLA based on the model driven architecture, {eid: 85062343820}>, <None, {eid: 84977134330}>, <None, {eid: 84928102655}>, <None, {eid: 84877588375}>, <None, {eid: 84928121719}>",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,12/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85062333445

In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today’s simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems.","capabilities, Digital twins, MBSE, model-based systems engineering, modelling, variability modelling, Virtual Testbeds",,,,,,,,"<Towards a Capability-Based Framework for Reconfiguring Industrial Production Systems, {eid: 84953897897, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.395}>, <A New eRobotics Approach to Simulation-Based Analysis and Optimization, {eid: 84946687863}>, <None, {eid: 85018936265}>, <A Navigation Framework for Digital Twins of Factories Based on Building Information Modeling, {eid: 85044445847}>, <None, {eid: 84555215963}>, <None, {eid: 85013920640}>, <None, {eid: 0003880013}>, <Modelling Capabilities for Functional Configuration of Part Feeding Equipment, {eid: 85029869010, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.357}>, <Simulation-Based Optimization of Camera Placement in the Context of Industrial Pose Estimation, {eid: 85047784412}>, <Integrating Compositional and Annotative Approaches for Product Line Engineering, {eid: 70349542003}>, <A Variability-Aware Module System, {eid: 84869778723}>, <Finite Element Analysis as a Key Functionality for eRobotics to Predict the Interdependencies between Robot Control and Structural Deformation, {eid: 85064719598}>, <Capability-Based Planning and Scheduling for Adaptable Manufacturing Systems, {eid: 84946691684}>, <A Framework for Modelling Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems Using Hybridized Discrete-Event and Agent-Based Simulation, {eid: 84953874139, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.297}>, <Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems: Principles, Design, and Future Trends, {eid: 85033406486, doi: 10.1007/s11465-018-0483-0}>, <Software Product Line Engineering and Variability Management: Achievements and Challenges, {eid: 84924174468}>, <A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-based Production Systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Aspect-Oriented Modeling for Variability Management, {eid: 55049084345}>, <None, {eid: 84892351987}>, <Interactive Calibration and Visual Programming of Reconfigurable Robotic Workcells, {eid: 85053873933}>, <None, {eid: 0003547470}>, <Delta-Oriented Programming of Software Product Lines, {eid: 78049372449}>, <Experimentable Digital Twins - Streamlining Simulation-Based Systems Engineering for Industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <Virtual Testbeds for the Development of Sensor-Enabled Applications, {eid: 85061513737}>, <Towards Interdisciplinary Variability Modeling for Automated Production Systems: Opportunities and Challenges When Applying Delta Modeling: A Case Study, {eid: 84949503154}>, <CESA 3 R: Highly Versatile Plug-And-Produce Assembly System, {eid: 85001022087}>, <Future Modeling and Simulation of CPS-based Factories: An Example from the Automotive Industry, {eid: 85012920563, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.168}>",,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,5/4/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85064719396

Due to the varied methodologies and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE). The purpose of this article is to provide a cursory description of the SoS basic concepts on the one hand, and then to analyse the main challenges in its development. Finally, we report the literature review showing various techniques and methods that have been modified from the conventional systems engineering to better fit the needs of SoSs design. We hope the findings of this work may encourage and inform the community researchers of the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these large-scale systems. Thus, the complexity of the SoS development lends itself nicely to a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) which provides communication and verification that transcends the levels of development. MBSE uses a model or set of models to document and communicate from the system requirements level down to the software implementation level.","Literature Review, Model-Based Systems Engineering, SoS Engineering, System-of-Systems",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85103812831}>, <None, {eid: 85103824737}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <Understanding the current state of us defense systems of systems and the implications for systems engineering, {eid: 79960988878}>, <Safety in system-of-systems: Ten key challenges, {eid: 84905399824}>, <Framework for managing system-of-systems ilities, {eid: 85062430925}>, <On systems of systems engineering: A requirements engineering perspective and research agenda, {eid: 85056820734}>, <None, {eid: 85103812281}>, <A survey on concepts, applications, and challenges in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84920971178}>, <Understanding transportation as a system-of-systems design problem, {eid: 30744450491}>, <Systems of systems engineering: Basic concepts, model-based techniques, and research directions, {eid: 84942794318}>, <System of systems engineering-new challenges for the 21st century, {eid: 44049101324}>, <None, {eid: 85082395897}>, <Healthcare system of systems, {eid: 47249147628}>, <None, {eid: 84954432139}>, <Systems of systems characterization and types, {eid: 84985885574}>, <Thinking smart cities as systems-of-systems: A perspective study, {eid: 85009437713}>, <1. 4. 3 system of systems pain points, {eid: 85045417936}>, <Towards a system of systems concepts, {eid: 0001217367}>, <Systems of systems test and evaluation challenges, {eid: 77956568147}>, <A model-driven approach for configuring and deploying systems of systems, {eid: 84879765624}>, <Model driven software security architecture of systemsof-systems, {eid: 85018521320}>, <A holistic viewpoint-based sysml profile to design systems-of-systems, {eid: 84962855652}>, <Systems-of-systems modelling using a comprehensive viewpoint-based sysml profile, {eid: 85018602926}>, <System of systems engineering: Meta-modelling perspective, {eid: 85091633953}>, <Towards a rigorous modelling formalism for systems of systems, {eid: 84861494413}>, <Using sysml modelling to understand and evolve systems of systems, {eid: 84872958304}>, <Architecting systemsof-systems and their constituents: A case study applying industry 4. 0 in the construction domain, {eid: 85074593146}>, <Involving the application domain expert in the construction of systems of systems, {eid: 85052328566}>, <An approach to integrate systems towards a directed system-of-systems, {eid: 85055682554}>, <A service-based architecture for virtual and collaborative system of systems, {eid: 85103822730}>, <None, {eid: 84942168293}>, <Developing ontologies for interoperability of systems of systems, {eid: 85103846598}>, <An ontological approach to system of systems engineering inproduct development, {eid: 85092421325}>, <Context-basedontology to describe system-of-systems interoperability, {eid: 84988292015}>, <Ontology-based systems engineering: A state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85071261797}>, <System of systems cyber effects simulation ontology, {eid: 84962920232}>, <A maude based specification for sos architecture, {eid: 85052294614}>, <Formally describing the software architecture of systems-of-systems with sosadl, {eid: 84985906010}>, <Formally describing the architectural behavior of software-intensive systems-of-systems with sosadl, {eid: 85012067003}>, <Calculus for sos: A foundation for formally describing software-intensive systems-of-systems, {eid: 84985963079}>, <A bigraphical multi-scale modelling methodology for system of systems, {eid: 85012303085}>, <System-of-systems support-a bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior, {eid: 84961313278}>, <Bigraph-ensured interoperability for system (-of-systems) emergence, {eid: 84910154287}>, <A tool for modelling sos architectures using bigraphs, {eid: 85020856109}>, <Modelling and simulation of net centric system of systems using systems modelling language and colored petri-nets: A demonstration using the global earth observation system of systems, {eid: 52649148111}>, <A metamodel for representing system-of-systems ontologies, {eid: 85051204692}>, <A service-oriented method for system-of-systems requirements analysis and architecture design, {eid: 84863268266}>, <A model driven service engineering approach to system of systems, {eid: 84902478455}>, <Opm & color petri nets based executable system of systems architecting: A building block in fila-sos, {eid: 84941265214}>, <None, {eid: 67650148256}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/28/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85103824540

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) there is yet no converged terminology. The term ‘system model’ is used in different contexts in literature. In this study we elaborated the definitions and usages of the term ‘system model’, to find a common definition. We analyzed 104 publications in depth for their usage and definition as well as their meta-data e.g., the publication year and publication background to find some common patterns. While the term is gaining more interest in recent years, it is used in a broad range of contexts for both analytical and synthetic use cases. Based on this, three categories of system models have been defined and integrated into a more precise definition.","Model informatics and analytics, Model-based collaboration, Model-based systems

Adoption of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) continues to grow in industry and government, and MBSE continues to be a major research theme in the systems engineering community. In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation.

Recent advances in multiband (MB) and multiecho (ME) techniques have greatly improved fMRI methods. MB imaging improves temporal and/or spatial resolution, while ME imaging has been shown to improve BOLD sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the novel MBME echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence utilizing MB and ME simultaneously to determine if the MBME outperform the MB single echo (MBSE) sequence for task fMRI. Purpose: To compare the performance of MBME with MBSE in a task fMRI study. Study Type: Prospective. Population: A total of 29 healthy volunteers aged 20–46 years (9 male, 20 female). Field Strength/Sequence: MBSE and MBME gradient-echo EPI sequences were applied at 3T. Additional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) was collected. Assessment: A checkerboard visual task was presented during the functional MBSE and MBME scans. The MBME or MBSE signal was evaluated using the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). Task activation was evaluated using the z-score, volume, sensitivity, and specificity. Test–retest metrics of task activation were examined with the Dice coefficient (DC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on subjects with repeated scans. Statistical Tests: A linear mixed-effects model was used to compared MBME and MBSE activation at the voxel base. The paired t-test was used to compare tSNR, activation z-score, and volume, along with sensitivity, specificity, and DC between MBSE and MBME. Results: While similar task activation was detected in the visual cortex, MBME showed higher activation volume and higher sensitivity compared with MBSE (P < 0.05). ICC was higher for MBME than MBSE, while there was a trend of differences in DC (P = 0.08). Data Conclusion: MBME resulted in higher task fMRI activation volume and sensitivity without losing specificity. Reliability was also higher for MBME scans compared with MBSE. Level of Evidence: 1.

For the traditional vehicle system safety analysis and design, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are usually conducted to evaluate the risk. However, for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), the autonomous system is more complex, and there are a lot of interactions among subsystems. Conventional hazard analysis methods on the basis of the linear chain of events are not applicable to CAVs because it is difficult to identify the potential hazards caused by system interactions or performance limits. A new hazard analysis method based on control theory and system theory, Systems Theory Process Analysis (STPA), can identify the potential hazards from the view of the whole system. Besides, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach is introduced to improve the consistency and traceability. In this article, a model-based hazard analysis method combining STPA and MBSE is proposed, which can map the development process in compliance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26262 and Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) standards. System assumptions and architecture from system engineering foundations can be used to form the item definition in the safety analysis process. Hazards can be identified by the STPA method based on preliminary system functions. Furthermore, causal factors and safety constraints from Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) can help developers to generate functional safety requirements and modify the preliminary system architecture. The Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system is taken as a typical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The hazardous state and casual factors for the AEB system is identified by STPA based on the system model, which is described by the systems modeling language (SysML). Meanwhile, the analysis results give the guidance for a safety-related system design. The proposed workflow promotes the collaboration between the system designer and safety analyzer and accelerates the system development iterations process.","Automatic emergency braking system, MBSE, Process approach, Safety analysis, STPA",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85061055790}>, <None, {eid: 85103211463}>, <None, {eid: 85103205077}>, <Towards ""vision Zero, {eid: 85072503764}>, <Domain Control Units - The Solution for Future E/E Architectures?, {eid: 85072350096}>, <Intelligent Vehicle Monitoring for Safety and Security, {eid: 85064710754}>, <None, {eid: 85103164353}>, <None, {eid: 85103212842}>, <An Approach to Support FMEA Specification in Automotive Systems, {eid: 84938309888}>, <Use of Fault Tree Analysis for Automotive Reliability and Safety Analysis, {eid: 85072444138}>, <Optimization-Based Robust Architecture Design for Autonomous Driving System, {eid: 85064604474}>, <A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems, {eid: 1342344540}>, <Autonomous Driving in Agriculture Leading to Autonomous Worksite Solutions, {eid: 85016491814}>, <Towards a Supermileage Autonomous Vehicle, {eid: 85018456959}>, <Safety Assessment of Complex, Software-Intensive Systems, {eid: 84871259042}>, <Deriving Verification Objectives and Scenarios for Maritime Systems Using the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis, {eid: 85026731435}>, <WE-G-BRA-07: Analyzing the Safety Implications of a Brachytherapy Process Improvement Project Utilizing a Novel System-Theory-Based Hazard-Analysis Technique, {eid: 85103205480}>, <Safety Analysis Based on Systems Theory Applied to an Unmanned Protective Vehicle, {eid: 85017379847}>, <Application of Systems Theoretic Process Analysis to a Lane Keeping Assist System, {eid: 85103175528}>, <None, {eid: 85103155042}>, <None, {eid: 85103171522}>, <None, {eid: 85103186266}>, <Review and Assessment of the ISO 26262 Draft Road Vehicle - Functional Safety, {eid: 85072507925}>, <Developing Functional Safety Requirements Using Process Model Variables, {eid: 84938347333}>, <Challenges in Managing ISO 26262 Software Development Projects, {eid: 84938306850}>, <Calculating Probability Metric for Random Hardware Failures (PMHF) in the New Version of ISO 26262 Functional Safety - Methodology and Case Studies, {eid: 85045419835}>, <Control Model of Automated Driving Systems Based on SOTIF Evaluation, {eid: 85083859783}>, <Integrating SOTIF and Agile Systems Engineering, {eid: 85064634353}>, <Assessing the Safety of Environment Perception in Automated Driving Vehicles, {eid: 85102148611}>, <None, {eid: 85066815225}>, <Hazard Analysis Method Based on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process, {eid: 85096471235}>, <A System-Theoretic Accident Model and Process with Human Factors Analysis and Classification System Taxonomy, {eid: 85047056769}>",,,SAE International,,,3/3/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85103185979
