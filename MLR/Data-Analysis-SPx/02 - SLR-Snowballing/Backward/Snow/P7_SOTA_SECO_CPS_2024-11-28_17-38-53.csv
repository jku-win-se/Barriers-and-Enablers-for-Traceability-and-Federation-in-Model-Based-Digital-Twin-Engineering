Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period.","Building Information Model (BIM), Energy saving, Green Building, Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast), {eid: 84855440065}>, <None, {eid: 78649784171}>, <Re (De) fining Net Zero Energy: Renewable Emergy Balance in environmental building design, {eid: 80052798303}>, <Case study of zero energy house design in UK, {eid: 69249208690}>, <None, {eid: 84858075740}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework, {eid: 84858071872}>, <Getting to net zero, {eid: 70349634940}>, <None, {eid: 79957854089}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies, {eid: 79951517816}>, <Net Zero Energy Homes of the Future: A Case Study of the écoTerraTM House in Canada, {eid: 79951510163}>, <Goal zero energy building-Exemplary experience based on the solar estate Solarsiedlung Freiburg am Schlierberg, {eid: 85059350562}>, <Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings: An Overview and Analysis onWorldwide Building Projects, {eid: 79955146310}>, <Check and evaluation system on heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of china based on multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, {eid: 64749088443}>, <None, {eid: 82055194442}>, <Renewable Substitutability Index: Maximizing Renewable Resource Use in Building, {eid: 84958761582}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status, {eid: 84886457808}>, <Evaluation of net-zero energy residential buildings in the MENA region, {eid: 84961784216}>, <None, {eid: 78349265716}>, <None, {eid: 85059349047}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition Preprint, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings, {eid: 84869864963}>, <None, {eid: 2242442162}>, <A CAD-based Approach to Embodied Energy Impact Modelling for Housing Design, {eid: 31044437419}>, <None, {eid: 31044449208}>, <Capital Energy Costs of Building and Recycling of Building Materials, {eid: 85059341810}>, <None, {eid: 85059348486}>, <None, {eid: 85059341528}>, <None, {eid: 85059345027}>, <Life cycle cost and energy analysis of a Net Zero Energy House with solar combisystem, {eid: 77957315695}>, <From net energy to zero energy buildings: Defining life cycle zero energy buildings (LC-ZEB), {eid: 77950299775}>, <How to define nearly net zero energy buildings nZEB, {eid: 84858075626}>, <A through-life evaluation of end-of-life rolling stocks considering asset recycling, energy recovering, and financial benefit, {eid: 85059297387}>, <Designing net-zero energy buildings for the future climate, not for the past, {eid: 84860435670}>, <None, {eid: 85059349691}>, <On-site or off-site renewable energy supply options?

Data-driven optimization can improve their economic and environmental performance and their macro-projection can help in the achievement of net-zero plans. This article extends the use of a framework containing the usage of data modeling and artificial intelligence to conduct different optimization scenarios of the geothermal-driven energy system. It includes the improvement of the economic, exergetic, energetic, and environmental performance through the development of various optimization scenarios. This is done through the development of an extensive thermodynamic model and validation based upon energy, exergy, economic, and environmental evaluations. Different machine learning techniques are adapted for digital twinning of the six performance indicators as a function of nine design variables including operational, source, and economic variables. It is shown that the artificial neural network offers the best statistical fit as compared to the other machine learning techniques including RMSE: 0.1768, R2:0.9999, MSE:0.0312, and MAE:0.1107 for the total work output. Energy-efficient design has yielded a total work output of 1044.86 kW, with a first law efficiency of 0.3322. The economic design offers the lowest cost of electricity at only 34.004 $/hr. The sensitivity analysis has shown that the following parameters are the most sensitivity: turbine inlet temperature (18.19%) and pressure (18.23%), geothermal inlet temperature (16.34%) and pressure (18.00%), and the ammonia water concentration at the inlet of separator (15.96%).","Artificial neural network, Computational intelligence, Efficient energy systems, Scenario-based optimization,

Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution. The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Hybrid renewable energy systems, Optimization, Potable water filtration, Sensitivity analysis, Wastewater treatment, Water-energy nexus",,,,,,,,"<Fresh water production by membrane distillation (MD) using marine engines waste heat, {eid: 85094313774, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100860}>, <Projecting global water footprints diminution of a dew-point cooling system: sustainability approach assisted with energetic and economic assessment, {eid: 85100005680, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2021.110741}>, <Water quality assessment of natural lakes and its importance: an overview, {eid: 85096620786, doi: 10.1016/j.matpr.2020.02.092}>, <An innovative air saturator for humidification-dehumidification desalination application, {eid: 85049354738, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.135}>, <Expansion planning of generation technologies in electric energy systems under water use constraints with renewable resources, {eid: 85095915401, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100828}>, <Multi-objective optimisation of constrained food-energy-water-nexus systems for sustainable resource allocation, {eid: 85099505169, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100967}>, <Energy, exergy and enviro-economic assessment of productivity enhanced passive double sided vertical convection solar distiller for fresh water production, {eid: 85092293972, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100846}>, <Extracting water content from the ambient air in a double-slope half-cylindrical basin solar still using silica gel under Egyptian conditions, {eid: 85083496930, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100712}>, <A solar-powered solution for water shortage problem in arid and semi-arid regions in coastal countries, {eid: 85066498726, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2019.05.015}>, <Energy and hydraulic efficiency in conventional water supply systems, {eid: 84889670771}>, <Analysis of Maisotsenko humid air bottoming cycle employing mixed flow air saturator, {eid: 85057305261, doi: 10.1007/s00231-018-2531-z}>, <Numerical heat transfer analysis of Maisotsenko Humid Air Bottoming Cycle – a study towards the optimization of the air-water mixture at bottoming turbine inlet, {eid: 85040454510, doi: 10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.01.024}>, <Enhancement of solar energy use by an integrated system for five useful outputs: System assessment, {eid: 85098778347, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2020.100952}>, <Replacing natural gas with solar and wind energy to supply the thermal demand of buildings in Iran: A simulation approach, {eid: 85101088741, doi: 10.1016/j.seta.2021.101047}>, <Sustainable energy: is it nuclear or solar for African Countries?

Some of this research is helping to solve humankind’s most pressing problems. However, as this provocation argues, up to 50% of the articles that are now being published in many interdisciplinary sustainability and transitions journals may be categorized as “scholarly bullshit.” These are articles that typically engage with the latest sustainability and transitions buzzword (e.g., circular economy), while contributing little to none to the scholarly body of knowledge on the topic. A typology of “scholarly bullshit” is proposed which includes the following archetypes: boring question scholarship, literature review of literature reviews, recycled research, master thesis madness, and activist rants. Since “scholarly bullshit” articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors. Citations matter most in the metric-driven logic of the academic system, and this type of scholarship, sadly, is thus unlikely to decrease in the coming years.","Circular economy, Scholarly bullshit, Sustainability, Sustainability transitions, Sustainable development, Theory of bullshit",,,,,,,,"<On bullshit, {eid: 3042610478}>, <None, {eid: 27744471870, doi: 10.1515/9781400826537}>, <None, {eid: 85053410623}>, <Conceptualizing the circular economy: an analysis of 114 definitions, {eid: 85029397642, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005}>",,,Springer Nature,,,3/1/2023,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85171300560

In the context of buildings and civil infrastructure, the notion of a digital twin remains ill-defined, with little or no consensus among researchers and practitioners of the ways in which digital twin processes and data-centric technologies can support design and construction. This paper builds on existing concepts of Building Information Modeling (BIM), lean project production systems, automated data acquisition from construction sites and supply chains, and artificial intelligence to formulate a mode of construction that applies digital twin information systems to achieve closed loop control systems. It contributes a set of four core information and control concepts for digital twin construction (DTC), which define the dimensions of the conceptual space for the information used in DTC workflows. Working from the core concepts, we propose a DTC information system workflow-including information stores, information processing functions, and monitoring technologies-according to three concentric control workflow cycles. DTC should be viewed as a comprehensive mode of construction that prioritizes closing the control loops rather than an extension of BIM tools integrated with sensing and monitoring technologies.","Building Information Modeling, construction planning and control, data-centric construction, digital twin, lean construction",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85119098886}>, <None, {eid:

Besides, the digital twin paves a way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing, which is an important bottleneck to achieve smart manufacturing. In this paper, the big data and digital twin in manufacturing are reviewed, including their concept as well as their applications in product design, production planning, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance. On this basis, the similarities and differences between big data and digital twin are compared from the general and data perspectives.

Nowadays increasingly intelligent, individualized products encourages companies to respond innovatively to customer requirements and to handle the rising product variations quickly. An integrated engineering network, spanning across the entire value chain, is operated to intelligently connect various company divisions, and to generate a business ecosystem for products, services and communities. The conditions for the digital twin are thereby determined in which the digital world can be fed into the real, and the real world back into the digital to deal such intelligent products with rising variations. The term digital twin can be described as a digital copy of a real factory, machine, worker etc., that is created and can be independently expanded, automatically updated as well as being globally available in real time. Every real product and production site is permanently accompanied by a digital twin. First prototypes of such digital twins already exist in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory on a cloud- and app-based software that builds on a dynamic, multidimensional data and information model. A standardized language of the robot control systems via software agents and positioning systems has to be integrated. The aspect of the continuity of the real factory in the digital factory as an economical means of ensuring continuous actuality of digital models looks as the basis of changeability. For the indoor localization sensor combinations that in addition to the hardware already contain the software required for the sensor data fusion should be used. Processing systems, scenario-live-simulations and digital shop floor management results in a mandatory procedural combination. Essential to the digital twin is the ability to consistently provide all subsystems with the latest state of all required information, methods and algorithms.","business ecosystem, cloud- and app-based platform, digital factory, digital shopfloor management, Digital twin, indoor localization, sensor combinations, software agents",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85194237223}>, <None, {eid: 43449112860}>, <None, {eid: 85194271755}>, <None, {eid: 85194228240}>, <None, {eid: 85020847231}>, <None, {eid: 85194262147}>, <None, {eid: 85194233767}>, <A Novel Approach for the Combined Use of AR Goggles and Mobile Devices as Communication Tools on the Shopfloor, {eid: 85194256010}>, <None, {eid: 85194248233}>, <None, {eid: 85194252814}>, <None, {eid: 85194239741}>, <None, {eid: 85194221164}>, <None, {eid: 85194253935}>, <None, {eid: 85194243499}>, <None, {eid: 85194270068}>, <None, {eid: 85194269958}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,1/1/2017,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85020859111

This paper presents a compact review about digital twins for PED from aspects of concepts, working principles, tools/platforms, and applications, in order to address the issues of both how a digital PED twin is made and what tools can be used for a digital PED twin. Four key components of digital PED twin are identified, i.e., a virtual model, sensor network integration, data analytics, and a stakeholder layer. Very few available tools now have full functions for digital PED twin, while most tools either have a focus on industrial applications or are designed for data collection, communication and visualization based on building information models (BIM) or geographical information system (GIS). Several observations gained from successful application are that current digital PED twins can be categorized into three tiers: (1) an enhanced version of BIM model only, (2) semantic platforms for data flow, and (3) big data analysis and feedback operation. Further challenges and opportunities are found in areas of data analysis and semantic interoperability, business models, data security, and management. The outcome of the review is expected to provide useful information for further development of digital PED twins and optimizing its sustainability.","application, digital twin, positive energy district, review, simulation tool",,,,,,,,"<Data security, privacy, availability and integrity in cloud computing: issues and current solutions, {eid: 85019206410, doi: 10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070464}>, <SPHERE: BIM digital twin platform, {eid: 85081081915, doi: 10.3390/proceedings2019020009}>, <A survey on data confidentiality and privacy in cloud computing, {eid: 85030468877, doi: 10.1145/3102304.3102314}>, <Modeling of data security in cloud computing, {eid: 84979238831, doi: 10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490658}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <None, {eid: 85123065556}>, <Data security and privacy protection issues in cloud computing, {eid: 84861072527, doi: 10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.193}>, <None, {eid: 85123086519}>, <None, {eid: 85123062640}>, <None, {eid: 85123103896}>, <None, {eid: 85123110758}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <An approach to data acquisition for urban building energy modeling using a gaussian mixture model and expectation-maximization algorithm, {eid: 85099990916, doi: 10.3390/buildings11010030}>, <None, {eid: 85123082674}>, <Towards the next generation of smart grids: semantic and holonic multiagent management of distributed energy resources, {eid: 85017566936, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.107}>, <None, {eid: 85123104373}>, <None, {eid: 85123078152}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 84968669593}>, <Fair P2P energy trading between residential and commercial multi-energy systems enabling integrated demand-side management, {eid: 85078962304, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114551}>, <Digital twin: vision, benefits, boundaries, and creation for buildings, {eid: 85077738936, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946515}>, <None, {eid: 85077118399, doi: 10.1145/3359997.3365734}>, <None, {eid: 85104498118}>, <None, {eid: 85123074391}>, <None, {eid: 85123064251}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <None, {eid: 85111421396}>, <None, {eid: 85123088972}>, <None, {eid: 85123086618}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85074335396, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.10.001}>, <Selection of energy performance contracting business models: a behavioral decision-making approach, {eid: 85009468569, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.058}>, <Data security challenges and its solutions in cloud computing, {eid: 84938915179, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.171}>, <None, {eid: 85123081657}>, <Business model innovation for sustainable energy: German utilities and renewable energy, {eid: 84884983829, doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.038}>, <A comparison of arrangements for increasing self-consumption and maximising the value of distributed photovoltaics on apartment buildings, {eid: 85072750095, doi: 10.1016/j.solener.2019.09.067}>, <None, {eid: 85082387061}>, <None, {eid: 85085171158}>, <None, {eid: 85097752653}>, <None, {eid: 85123092752}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 85112079295}>, <None, {eid: 85123092089}>, <None, {eid: 85123091342}>, <Peer-to-peer energy trading in a microgrid, {eid: 85044466952, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.010}>",,,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,6/21/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85115005557

Most existing railway stations in the UK is historic and have been operated for many years. Maintenance and reconstruction are common concerns in the public railway industry, and clusters of information pertaining to this maintenance must be managed appropriately for effective outcome. Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. This paper discusses a specific BIM application within the context of railway station buildings using a Revit-based simulation of construction work for King's Cross station in London. The paper highlights the adoption and transformation of 3D model of the King's Cross station building into a 6D building information model. The 6D model contains a time and cost schedule with carbon emissions calculation, and renovation assumptions using Revit. The outcome of this study can provide construction participants with reasonable guidance of BIM adoption on railway station projects that can be used for planning, designing, and operating an economic and environmental efficient construction project.","BIM, BIM adoption on existing buildings, Digital twin, Green construction, Railway station building, Revit",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85064710721}>, <Building information modeling: framework for collaboration, {eid: 77955312782}>, <Building information modeling (BIM): now and beyond, {eid: 84870925948, doi: 10.5130/ajceb.v12i4.3032}>, <None, {eid: 84925365610}>, <None, {eid: 84874957176}>, <The Implementation of building information modelling in the United Kingdom by the transport industry, {eid: 84941045323, doi: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.232}>, <None, {eid: 85064663269}>, <None, {eid: 79960255383}>, <The kings cross underground fire and the setting up of the investigation, {eid: 0026678094}>, <Simulation of automated data collection in buildings, {eid: 0029196815}>, <None, {eid: 84940108417}>, <Construction scheduling using genetic algorithm based on building information model, {eid: 84904159684, doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.047}>, <None, {eid: 85064698942}>, <None, {eid: 77958596448}>, <None, {eid: 61649095682, doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00676.x}>, <Introducing a new limit states design concept to railway concrete sleepers: an Australian experience, {eid: 84904729249, doi: 10.3389/fmats.2014.00008}>, <Strategic framework to achieve carbon-efficient construction and maintenance of railway infrastructure systems, {eid: 84943397099, doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2015.00006}>, <Grand challenges in transportation transit systems, {eid: 84997615254, doi: 10.3389/fbuil.2016.00004}>, <Field investigation and parametric study of greenhouse gas emissions from railway plain-line renewals, {eid: 84948807326, doi: 10.1016/j.trd.2015.10.021}>, <Evaluation of CO2emissions from railway resurfacing maintenance activities.

The integration provides a new disruptive approach for vertical integration and optimization of the greenhouse production processes to improve energy efficiency, production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability. Applying the Industry 4.0 Digital Twin concept to the Danish horticulture greenhouse industry provides digital models for simulating and evaluating the physical greenhouse facility’s performance. A Digital Twin combines modeling, AI, and Big Data analytics with IoT and traditional sensor data from the production and cloud-based enterprise data to predict how the physical twin will perform under varying operational conditions. The Digital Twins support the co-optimization of the production schedule, energy consumption, and labor cost by considering influential factors, including production deadlines, quality grading, heating, artificial lighting, energy prices (gas and electricity), and weather forecasts. The ecosystem of digital twins extends the state-of-the-art by adopting a scalable distributed approach of “system of systems” that interconnects Digital Twins in a production facility. A collection of specialized Digital Twins are linked together to describe and simulate all aspects of the production chain, such as overall production capacity, energy consumption, delivery dates, and supply processes. The contribution of this project is to develop an ecosystem of digital twins that collectively capture the behavior of an industrial greenhouse facility. The ecosystem will enable the industrial greenhouse facilities to become increasingly active participants in the electricity grid.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Energy flexibility, Greenhouse, Industry 4.0",,,,,,,,"<Modeling techniques used in building HVAC control systems: a review, {eid: 85037732136, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.10.044}>, <None, {eid: 85085480507}>, <None, {eid: 85115627798}>, <ModestPy: An open-source python tool for parameter estimation in functional mock-up units, {eid: 85115646065}>, <Practical factors of envelope model setup and their effects on the performance of model predictive control for building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems, {eid: 85057737648, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.093}>, <Agent-based modeling of climate and electricity market impact on commercial greenhouse growers’ demand response adoption, {eid: 85090291512}>, <Agent-based modeling for optimizing CO2 reduction in commercial greenhouse production with the implicit demand response, {eid: 85091534810}>, <Integrating commercial greenhouses in the smart grid with demand response based control of supplemental lighting, {eid: 85019126541}>, <Integrating commercial greenhouses in the smart grid with demand response based control of supplemental lighting, {eid: 85019126541}>, <Tool-wear prediction and pattern-recognition using artificial neural network and DNA-based computing, {eid: 84944699289, doi: 10.1007/s10845-015-1155-0}>, <The greenhouse care system: a decision-support system for height control and scheduling of potted flowering plants, {eid: 0002439993, doi: 10.17660/ActaHortic.1996.417.4}>, <Industry 4.0 technologies: Implementation patterns in manufacturing companies, {eid: 85060082633, doi: 10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.01.004}>, <Virtual grower: software to calculate heating costs of greenhouse production in the United States, {eid: 77956213387, doi: 10.21273/HORTTECH.20.4.778}>, <None, {eid: 85110899969}>, <Energy oriented simulation of manufacturing systems – concept and application, {eid: 79957656407, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2011.03.127}>, <A universal simulator for ecological models, {eid: 84870821845, doi: 10.1016/j.ecoinf.2012.11.001}>, <None, {eid: 85115654233}>, <None, {eid: 85115662661}>, <Planning community energy system in the industry 4.0 era: achievements, challenges and a potential solution, {eid: 85019024484, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.04.004}>, <An integrated simulation and decision support system for greenhouse climate control (InfoGrow 2.0) based on an open source greenhouse modelling platform, {eid: 85082690835}>, <Timing growth and development of Campanula by daily light integral and supplemental light level in a cost-efficient light control system, {eid: 84863522779, doi: 10.1016/j.scienta.2012.06.026}>, <Cost-efficient light control for production of two campanula species, {eid: 79960418940, doi: 10.1016/j.scienta.2011.05.003}>, <An on-line tool for optimising greenhouse crop production, {eid: 84870669915, doi: 10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.957.16}>, <Decision support for optimising energy consumption in European greenhouses, {eid: 71449085011, doi: 10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.801.94}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: a categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Energy flexibility in retail buildings: From a business ecosystem perspective, {eid: 85027138499}>, <None, {eid: 85115658149}>, <Energy flexibility of the commercial greenhouse growers: The potential and benefits of participating in the electricity market, {eid: 85050672446}>, <None, {eid: 85085512089}>, <The application of ontologies in multi-agent systems in the energy sector: a scoping review, {eid: 85071248173, doi: 10.3390/en12163200}>, <Intelligrow 2.0 -

After collecting enough measurements, the DT firstly predicts the physical twin performance during training and, in case of non-optimal result, it suggests modifications in the athlete's behavior. The athlete's team is integrated into SmartFit, a software framework for supporting trainers and coaches in monitoring and manage athletes' fitness activity and results. Through IoT sensors embedded in wearable devices and applications for manual logging (e.g. mood, food income), SmartFit continuously captures measurements, initially treated as the dynamic data describing the current physical twins' status. Dynamic data allows adapting each DT's status and triggering the DT's predictions and suggestions. The analyzed measurements are stored as the historical data, further processed by the DT to update (increase) its knowledge and ability to provide reliable predictions. Results show that, thanks to the team of DTs, SmartFit computes trustable predictions of the physical twins' conditions and produces understandable suggestions which can be used by trainers to trigger optimization actions in the athletes' behavior. Though applied in the sport context, SmartFit can be easily adapted to other monitoring tasks.","Counterfactual explanations, Digital twins, Internet of Things, Machine learning, Smart health,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital twin, a concept introduced in 2002, is becoming increasingly relevant to systems engineering and, more specifically, to model-based system engineering (MBSE). A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter’s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system’s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds.","Digital thread, Digital twin, Internet of things, Model based systems engineering (MBSE) experimentation testbed, Model-based systems engineering, Simulation, Virtual prototype",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85065979452}>, <What is Digital Twin Technology—And Why is It so Important?, {eid: 85056624416}>, <None, {eid: 85073094003}>, <Untangling the Digital Thread: The Challenge and Promise of Model-Based Engineering in Defense Acquisition, {eid: 85032443075}>, <HPCMP CREATE-AV and the Air Force Digital Thread, {eid: 84980329364}>, <None, {eid: 85111556379}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 85059806799}>, <Expanding Stakeholder Participation in Upfront System Engineering Through Storytelling in Virtual Worlds, {eid: 84920868198}>, <Exploring and Assessing Complex System Behavior through Model-Driven Storytelling, {eid: 84938059629}>, <Toward an Experiential Design Language: Augmenting Model-Based Systems Engineering with Technical Storytelling in Virtual Worlds, {eid: 84897978831}>, <A Trainable On-Line Model of the Human Operator in Information Acquisition Tasks, {eid: 0020154862}>, <Experimentable Digital Twins for Model-Based Systems Engineering and Simulation-Based Development, {eid: 85021452617}>, <Experimentable Digital Twins—Streamlining Simulation-Based Systems Engineering for Industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins: Simulation-based development and operation of complex technical systems, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Model Based Systems Engineering: Motivation, Current Status, and Research Opportunities, {eid: 85046694426}>, <Model-Based Systems Engineering: Motivation, Current Status, and Needed Advances, {eid: 85048873635}>, <Simulation-based Verification with Experimentable Digital Twins in Virtual testbeds, {eid: 85071048120}>, <What are Digital Twins?

It does not release any carbon emissions to pollute our planet. The wind farms monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a 5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based digital twins' framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power. The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly, it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our designed approach obtained better results.

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future.","BIM, Digital twin, Existing building, Net Zero Energy Building, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2017, {eid: 84894378197}>, <Towards Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings Definition of Common Principles under the EPBD-Final Report, {eid: 84906815954}>, <A Digital-Twin Evaluation of Net Zero Energy Building for Existing Buildings., {eid: 85059346336}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework., {eid: 84858071872}>, <Energy efficient design of building: A review., {eid: 84860223899}>, <Design of a Sustainable Building: A Conceptual Framework for Implementing Sustainability in the Building Sector., {eid: 85077711816}>, <Energy and Sustainable Strategies in the renovation of existing buildings: An Italian Case Study., {eid: 85197038195}>, <Integrated life cycle assessment and thermodynamic simulation of a public buildings envelope renovation: Conventional vs. Passivhaus proposal, {eid: 85040317509}>, <Regenerative Design of Existing Buildings for Net-Zero Energy Use., {eid: 84948443104}>, <Optical and thermal characterization of multiple glazed windows with low U-values., {eid: 0028413030}>, <Annual thermal evaluation of a double pane window using glazing available in the Mexican market., {eid: 85050146968}>, <Thermal analysis of triple and quadruple windows using partitioning radiant energy veils? with different physical and optical properties, {eid: 85055081957}>, <None, {eid: 85082943441}>, <None, {eid: 85082946648}>, <None, {eid: 85082929946}>, <None, {eid: 85082969997}>, <None, {eid: 85082946095}>, <None, {eid: 85082962564}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies., {eid: 79951517816}>, <Integration of renewable energy technology in building., {eid: 80055005162}>, <Integrating renewable energy technologies to support building trigeneration-A multi-criteria analysis., {eid: 84155166959}>, <Comprehensive use of renewable energy in building., {eid: 84884810513}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status., {eid: 84886457808}>, <None, {eid: 85082974517}>, <None, {eid: 85082946262}>, <None, {eid: 85082963190}>, <None, {eid: 85082953929}>, <None, {eid: 85082975916}>, <Control system and energy saving potential for switchable windows, {eid: 0011876305}>, <None, {eid: 85082974334}>, <None, {eid: 85082965652}>, <None, {eid: 85082958499}>, <None, {eid: 85082943998}>, <None, {eid: 85082962096}>, <None, {eid: 85082975572}>, <None, {eid: 85082926162}>, <Thermal properties optimization of envelope in energy-saving renovation of existing public buildings., {eid: 84896530062}>, <None, {eid: 85082925511}>, <None, {eid: 85082922233}>, <None, {eid: 85082932259}>, <None, {eid: 85082961571}>, <None, {eid: 85082974641}>, <None, {eid: 85082933534}>, <None, {eid: 85082927574}>, <None, {eid: 85082942378}>, <Grand challenges in transportation and transit systems., {eid: 84997615254}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85082879525

The proposed process utilizes an ultrahigh fidelity model of individual aircraft by tail number, a Digital Twin, to integrate computation of structural deflections and temperatures in response to flight conditions, with resulting local damage and material state evolution. A conceptual model of how the Digital Twin can be used for predicting the life of aircraft structure and assuring its structural integrity is presented. The technical challenges to developing and deploying a Digital Twin are discussed in detail. Copyright © 2011 Eric J.

The authors clarify the possibilities by reviewing 140 systematic reviews published in academic and practitioner outlets to answer the following three questions: (i) Why is grey literature excluded from/included in systematic reviews in MOS? (ii) What types of grey material have been included in systematic reviews since guidelines for practice were first established in this discipline? (iii) How is the grey literature treated currently to advance management and organization scholarship and knowledge?

In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms to learn, reason, and build the 'digital twin' of a patient. Computational models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and enabling the vision of precision medicine.","Artificial intelligence, Computational modelling, Digital twin, Precision medicine",,,,,,,,"<Precision medicine in cardiology, {eid: 84976448008}>, <From genetics to smart watches: developments in precision cardiology, {eid: 85058940139}>, <A new initiative on precision medicine, {eid: 84923762812}>, <Promises, promises, and precision medicine, {eid: 85062423215}>, <Precision medicine vs preventive medicine, {eid: 85060593774}>, <Evolution beyond neo-Darwinism: a new conceptual framework, {eid: 84924264935}>, <Integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling-perspectives, challenges, and opportunities in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences, {eid: 85135599036}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Teaching cardiovascular medicine to machines, {eid: 85050918165}>, <Length-dependent tension in the failing heart and the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 78751507006}>, <Differentiating electromechanical from non-electrical substrates of mechanical discoordination to identify responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 84955475978}>, <SMOD - Data Augmentation Based on Statistical Models of Deformation to Enhance Segmentation in 2D Cine Cardiac MRI, {eid: 85067176547, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-21949-9-39}>, <Machine-learning integration of complex echocardiographic patterns and clinical parameters from cohorts and trials, {eid: 85092288720, doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz745.0147}>, <Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?, {eid: 85047537837}>, <Big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care: promise and challenges, {eid: 84961393205}>, <Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular imaging: JACC state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85062806342}>, <Computational models in cardiology, {eid: 85055544890}>, <Enabling precision cardiology through multiscale biology and systems medicine, {eid: 85033597806}>, <Recent developments in using mechanistic cardiac modelling for drug safety evaluation, {eid: 84959289711}>, <None, {eid: 0004110543}>, <Computational modelling of 1D blood flow with variable mechanical properties and its application to the simulation of wave propagation in the human arterial system, {eid: 0242497983}>, <Random forest for automatic assessment of heart failure severity in a telemonitoring scenario, {eid: 84886524376}>, <Gaussian process robust regression for noisy heart rate data, {eid: 50049125217}>, <Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics, {eid: 85048201970}>, <Patient-specific computer modeling to predict aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, {eid: 84959872264}>, <Patient-specific cardiovascular computational modeling: diversity of personalization and challenges, {eid: 85049612985}>, <The role of computational modeling and simulation in the total product life cycle of peripheral vascular devices, {eid: 85018379109}>, <Multi-modality image-based computational analysis of haemodynamics in aortic dissection, {eid: 84944603147}>, <""Virtual"" (computed) fractional flow reserve, {eid: 84937739100}>, <The estimation of patient-specific cardiac diastolic functions from clinical measurements, {eid: 84883865079}>, <Left ventricular diastolic myocardial stiffness and end-diastolic myofibre stress in human heart failure using personalised biomechanical analysis, {eid: 85049665722}>, <A finite-element approach to the direct computation of relative cardiovascular pressure from time-resolved MR velocity data, {eid: 84861976269}>, <Non-invasive pressure difference estimation from PC-MRI using the work-energy equation, {eid: 84942257432}>, <Beyond Bernoulli: improving the accuracy and precision of non-invasive estimation of peak pressure drops, {eid: 85009860323}>, <Diagnostic performance of noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography in suspected coronary artery disease, {eid: 84896972430}>, <Noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CT angiography, {eid: 84944041048}>, <Non-invasive fractional flow reserve using computed tomographic angiography: where are we now and where are we going?, {eid: 85024487439}>, <Advancing regulatory science with computational modeling for medical devices at the FDAs Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories, {eid: 85062702939, doi: 10.3389/fmed.2018.00241}>, <Noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms: a feasibility report noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms.

While there has been considerable focus on ‘why’ organizations operating in the construction industry need to adopt digital technologies to enable Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 and thus deliver assets more effectively and efficiently, there has been limited attention given to ‘how’ they can realize their expected benefits and simultaneously generate value. In light of the drive for organizations to engage with digital technology we bring to the fore in this paper the need for them to legitimize a process of benefits management prior to making a financial investment to understand ‘how’ digital technologies can coalesce to generate business value and improve their competitiveness. As part of a benefits management strategy, a business dependency network (BDN) can enable investment objectives and their resulting benefits to be linked in a structured manner with an organization's capabilities and changes required to ensure they are realized. Relying on empirical findings derived from nine projects that examined the efficiency gains and advantages of using a digital systems information model from an engineering to asset management perspective, we construct a generic BDN to visualize the structure of multiple cause-effect relationships that are used to organise the capabilities, changes and benefits that need to be considered prior to adoption. The insights and experiences that have emerged from this research provide a frame of reference for construction organizations and asset owners to navigate the benefits realization and change management process, which can be used to ensure their investments in digital technology can effectively respond to business drivers and generate value.","Benefits dependency network, Benefits management, Change, Digital technology, digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Internet of things, {eid: 85070681752}>, <Unpacking the ambiguity of rework in construction: making sense of the literature, {eid: 85061095643, doi: 10.1080/10286608.2019.1577396}>, <Re-engineering construction: a new management research agenda, {eid: 0013246537, doi: 10.1080/01446199400000065}>, <Conceptualizing the FinDD API plug-in: a study of BIM-FM integration, {eid: 85016426450, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2017.03.015}>, <BIM-based integrated delivery technologies for intelligent MEP management in the operation and maintenance phase, {eid: 85028002540, doi: 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2017.08.007}>, <Building information modeling in ‘practice’: views from a collaboration and change management perspective during construction, {eid: 85038558205, doi: 10.1080/09537287.2017.1407005}>, <None, {eid: 85019757746, doi: 10.1080/09537287.2017.1333647}>, <None, {eid: 0003096924}>, <Benefits and Lessons Learned of Implementing Building Virtual Design and Construction Technologies for Coordination of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing Systems on a Large Healthcare Project, {eid: 46349088624}>, <Benefits of collaborative ICT adoption for building project management, {eid: 84993081927, doi: 10.1108/14714170910973529}>, <How to measure the benefits of BIM: a case study, {eid: 84860281943, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2012.02.008}>, <From justification to evaluation: building information modeling for asset owners, {eid: 84884502868, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2013.05.008}>, <Exploring the benefits of structured information with the use of virtual design and construction principles in a BIM life-cycle approach, {eid: 85060737440, doi: 10.1080/17452007.2018.1546165}>, <Propagation of a parsimonious framework for evaluating information systems in construction, {eid: 33748200009, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2005.09.005}>, <Information systems evaluation and the information systems development process, {eid: 84986105955, doi: 10.1108/17410390410548689}>, <A taxonomy of evaluation methods for information systems artifacts, {eid: 84951112173, doi: 10.1080/07421222.2015.1099390}>, <Approaches to ex-ante evaluation of investments into information systems, {eid: 3042613140, doi: 10.1007/BF03250934}>, <Information technology: of value or a vulture, {eid: 10244262711, doi: 10.1016/j.emj.2004.09.025}>, <The IT Value Quest: How to Capture the Business Value of IT-Based Infrastructure, {eid: 0003949495}>, <The impact of enterprise application integration on information system lifecycles, {eid: 0141993826, doi: 10.1016/S0378-7206(03)00046-6}>, <None, {eid: 85070664831}>, <The practice of IS/IT benefits management in large Australian organizations, {eid: 0041819328, doi: 10.1016/S0378-7206(03)00002-8}>, <Benefits Management, Delivering Value from IS, and IT Investments, {eid: 33750942142}>, <Benefits Realisation Management: A Practical Guide for Delivering Benefits through Change, {eid: 67650255782}>, <Project governance, benefits management, and project success: towards a framework for supporting organizational strategy implementation, {eid: 85033545733, doi: 10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.07.007}>, <Benefits realization management of building information modeling: obtaining value for asset owners, {eid: 84885394627, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.007}>, <Manufacturings next act, {eid: 84991364515}>, <Benefits realization management and its influence on project success and the execution of business strategies, {eid: 84912150213, doi: 10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.011}>, <Why IT fumbles analytics, {eid: 84871688488}>, <Five ways BIM 360 docs reduces construction rework, {eid: 85070693171}>, <Measuring the impact of BIM in complex projects, {eid: 85070705613}>, <Woodside tags a smart saving idea, {eid: 85070663287}>, <What is good science?, {eid: 85070673592}>, <Unlocking the sustained and business value from IT investments, {eid: 29144473661, doi: 10.2307/41166327}>, <Project benefit management: setting effective target benefits, {eid: 85044160061, doi: 10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.01.002}>, <What about the benefits?

The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge base. However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research.

Several efforts have been made to automate construction processes but marginial success has been achieved in effectively reducing the long standing risks suffered by the industry. While industry 4.0 promises to improve project efficiency, reduce waste and improve productivity, the transition to this will depend on the successful adoption of many emerging technologies such as virtual design modeling technologies, sensing technologies, data analysis, storage and communication technologies, human-computer interaction technologies, and robotics. To accelerate innovation, digital twins and cyber-physical systems will be a necessity to advance automation and real-time control with these technologies. While digital twin represents a digital replica of the asplanned and as-built facility, cyber physical systems involve integration of physical systems with their digital replica through sensors and actuators. Despite evidence of the efficacy of cyber-physical systems and digital twins for reducing non-fatal injuries, enhancing safety management, improving progress monitoring and enhancing performance monitoring and control of facilities, their adoption in the construction industry is still in its infancy. This paper sheds light on the opportunities offered by cyber-physical systems and digital twins in other industry sectors and advocates for their increased deployment in the construction industry. This paper describes cyber-physical integration of emerging technologies with the physical construction or constructed facility as the next generation digital twin and cyber-physical systems. Potential scenarios of next generation cyber physical system and digital twin for improving workforce productivity, health, and safety, lifecycle management of building systems, and workforce competency are presented.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twins, Next generation, Physical construction, Virtual models",,,,,,,,"<Scenarios for cyber-physical systems integration in construction,
