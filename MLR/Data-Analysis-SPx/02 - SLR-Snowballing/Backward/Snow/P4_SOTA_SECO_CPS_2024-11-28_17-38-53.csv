All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

Accordingly, various architectures for the realization of Digital Twin use cases are conceptualized. There lacks, however, a clear, encompassing architecture covering necessary components of a Digital Twin to realize various use cases in an intelligent automation system. In this contribution, the added value of a Digital Twin in an intelligent automation system is highlighted and various existing definitions and architectures of the Digital Twin are discussed. Flowingly, an architecture for a Digital Twin and an architecture for an Intelligent Digital Twin and their required components are proposed, with which use cases such as plug and produce, self-x and predictive maintenance are enabled. In the opinion of the authors, a Digital Twin requires three main characteristics: Synchronization with the real asset, active data acquisition from the real environment and the ability of simulation. In addition to all the characteristics of a Digital Twin, an Intelligent Digital Twin must also include the characteristics of Artificial Intelligence. The Intelligent Digital Twin can be used for the realization of the autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems. In order to realize the proposed architecture for a Digital Twin, several methods, namely the Anchor-Point-Method, a method for heterogeneous data acquisition and data integration as well as an agent-based method for the development of a co-simulation between Digital Twins were implemented and evaluated.","Architecture of Digital Twin, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber-Physical Production System, Intelligent Digital Twin",,,,,,,,"<Transitioning from standard automation solutions to cyber-physical production systems: An assessment of critical conceptual and technical challenges, {eid: 85057930631}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Framework and conceptual model for reconfiguration, {eid: 11844282657}>, <IT-Lsungen für den Produktentwicklungsprozess, {eid: 85073870414}>, <None, {eid: 85053283464}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <None, {eid: 85073876432}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in iiot systems, {eid: 85062630045}>, <Digital twin-proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <Digital twin-the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <None, {eid: 85067391058}>, <Multidimensionale Datenmodellierung und Analyse zur Qualitätssicherung in der Fertigungsautomatisierung, {eid: 85073871285}>, <Anomaly detection in discrete manufacturing using self-learning approaches, {eid: 85065419778}>, <None, {eid: 85073872017}>, <Consistency check to synchronize the digital twin of manufacturing automation based on anchor points, {eid: 85049592057}>, <None, {eid: 77954350348}>, <Use of dynamic product and process information in a production monitoring and control system by means of caex and opc ua, {eid: 84950151926}>, <None, {eid: 84919373075}>, <None, {eid: 85073869623}>, <None, {eid: 85006975247}>, <None, {eid: 77957342423}>, <None, {eid: 85046958120}>, <None, {eid: 85068844844}>, <Visualisierung und Analyseunterstützung von Zusammenhängen in SPS-Programmen zur Verbesserung der Modularität und Wiederverwendung, {eid: 85044459784}>, <None, {eid: 85073874596}>, <Änderungsszenarien in der Automatisierungstechnik-Herausforderungen und interdisziplinäre Auswirkungen, {eid: 85043066470}>, <Combining a sysml-based modeling approach and semantic technologies for analyzing change influences in manufacturing plant models, {eid: 84904504371}>, <An integrated approach to analyze change-situations in the development of production systems, {eid: 84904459479}>, <Konzept eines wissensbasierten frameworks zur spezifikation und diagnose von inkonsistenzen in mechatronischen modellen, {eid: 84961778471}>, <None, {eid: 84914151563}>, <Automationml server-a prototype data management system for multi disciplinary production engineering, {eid: 84879194236}>, <Product Lifecycle Management for Cross-X Engineering Design, {eid: 84862634804}>, <Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) mit Siemens Teamcenter, {eid: 85073870095}>, <Life Cycle Engineering-Integration of New Products on Existing Production Systems in Automotive, {eid: 80052122209}>, <A Case Study for a Digital Twin of Body-in-White Production Systems General Concept for Automated Updating of Planning Projects in the Digital Factory, {eid: 85057237609}>, <A concept in synchronization of virtual production system with real factory based on anchor-point method, {eid: 85044658638}>, <Approach to interconnect existing industrial automation systems with the Industrial Internet, {eid: 84996486536}>, <Predictive Analytics Model for Power Consumption in Manufacturing, {eid: 84903614856}>, <Cloud-based Control Approach in Discrete Manufacturing Using a Self-Learning Architecture, {eid: 85050969776}>, <Synchronization of a Plug-and-Simulate-capable Co-Simulation of Internet-of-Things-Components, {eid: 85065430881}>, <A survey on dynamic simulation of automation systems and components in the Internet of Things, {eid: 85044452595}>, <Dynamic Co-Simulation of Internet-of-Things-Components using a Multi-Agent-System, {eid: 85049587499}>, <Dynamische Co-Simulation von Automatisierungssystemen und ihren Komponenten im Internet der Dinge-Prozessorientierte Interaktion von IoT-Komponenten, {eid: 85073876177}>",,,De Gruyter Oldenbourg,,,9/25/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85073869890,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Open source technology can comprise of software, hardware and hybrid solutions that nowadays drive Smart Manufacturing. The major potential of open source technology in Smart Manufacturing lies in enabling interoperability and in reducing the capital costs of designing and implementing new manufacturing solutions. After presenting our motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes with research questions to be addressed in the future.","Digital Twin, micro-services architecture, open source technology, Smart CPS",,,,,,,,"<A Semantic-Based Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) Discovery and Selection System, {eid: 84893669179, doi: 10.1177/1753193412446112}>, <Characterization of Hadoop Jobs Using Unsupervised Learning, {eid: 79952469495, doi: 10.1109/CloudCom.2010.20}>, <Ontology-Based Reconfiguration Agent for Intelligent Mechatronic Systems in Flexible Manufacturing, {eid: 77955665456, doi: 10.1016/j.rcim.2009.12.001}>, <A Systematic Approach to Developing Ontologies for Manufacturing Service Modeling, {eid: 84893737237, doi: 10.1094/PDIS-11-11-0999-PDN}>, <Learning Significant Locations and Predicting User Movement with GPS, {eid: 84952004685, doi: 10.1109/ISWC.2002.1167224}>, <Using GPS to Learn Significant Locations and Predict Movement across Multiple Users, {eid: 84875644869, doi: 10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0}>, <Ontology-Driven Adaptive Sensor Networks.

New drive train concepts with Li-Ion battery system as central component arise. Nowadays, efforts are made to monitor the battery system in order to ensure maximum safety and reliability. But still, many parts of the life cycle of a battery system are not under accurate supervision. This paper proposes a digital twin architecture for automotive battery systems, on which digital services for various stakeholders along the manufacturing and product life cycle of a battery system can be established. Those services make use of the digital twin as a backbone, close open gaps and enable novel approaches in manufacturing and product use. The results feature an UML meta model as a first step toward implementing of a digital twin for battery systems. The meta model reflects the proposed architecture and allows domain-specific models to be built. The models in turn can act as blueprint for the implementation of the digital twin paradigm over the whole life cycle.","Architecture, Battery System, Digital Twin, UML Model",,,,,,,,"<Automotive revolution & perspective towards 2030, {eid: 85029538241, doi: 10.1365/s40112-016-1117-8}>, <Die automotive Agenda der Zukunft-Automobilzulieferer vor immensen Herausforderungen, {eid: 85070862942}>, <From vision to reality: Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84992510993}>, <A cyber physical interface for automation systems-methodology and examples, {eid: 85048391353, doi: 10.3390/machines3020093}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461, doi: 10.1109/DSD.2012.39}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing : A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <The air force digital thread/digital twin-life cycle integration and use of computational and experimental knowledge, {eid: 85007463616, doi: 10.2514/6.2016-0897}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Cloudconnected battery management for decision making on second-life of electric vehicle batteries, {eid: 85048526707, doi: 10.1109/EVER.2018.8362355}>, <Future modeling and simulation of cps-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.168}>, <Simulation-based identification of critical scenarios for cooperative and automated vehicles, {eid: 85045528477, doi: 10.4271/2018-01-1066}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85015767302, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006}>, <A domain-specific modeling language for electric vehicle batteries, {eid: 85070934866}>, <Enhanced data models for master and transaction data in ERP systems-unitary structuring approach, {eid: 70350199461}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <Main aging mechanisms in Li ion batteries, {eid: 24944549062, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.172}>, <None, {eid: 85057596443}>, <Anforderungen an Batterien für die Elektromobilit ät, {eid: 84979661720, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-30653-2.32}>, <None, {eid: 84975811561, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-30653-2}>, <None, {eid: 84937877628}>, <Aktueller begriff industrie 4.0, {eid: 85070905720}>, <New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing: Framework and characteristics, {eid: 85029168787, doi: 10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723764}>, <Services : SOA Microservices und Selfcontained Systems, {eid: 85070870946}>, <Design of emerging digital services: A taxonomy, {eid: 56749085318, doi: 10.1057/ejis.2008.38}>, <None, {eid: 65349136640, doi: 10.1007/3-540-28582-2}>, <Degradation mechanisms and lifetime prediction for lithiumion batteries & A control perspective, {eid: 84940927478, doi: 10.1109/ACC.2015.7170820}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/6/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85070853718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,9/25/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robotics technology can accomplish these demands, but programming and re-configuration of robots are associated with high costs, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The use of digital twins can significantly reduce these costs by providing monitoring and simulation capabilities for the robot and its environment using real-time data. The integration with an ontology as a knowledge base to describe the robot and its 3d-environment enables an automatic configuration of the digital twin and the particular robot. In this paper, this concept is coupled with cloud-computing to enable an effortless integration as service in existing cloud architectures and easy access using the common web-technology-stack for the end-users. A novel architecture is presented and implemented to incorporate the real system with its digital twin, the ontology and a planner to infer the actual operations from the knowledge base. Finally, the implementation is applied to the industrial manufacturing domain to assemble different THT-Devices on a PCB to evaluate the concept.","Autonomous system, Digital twin, Industrial robotic, Ontology",,,,,,,,"<A framework for robot control software development and debugging using a real-time capable physics simulation, {eid: 84983740463}>, <A uniform data model for representing symbiotic assembly stations.

Management and connection to those things create integrability and usability issues. Hence, there is a need for a solution that facilitates the communication between different devices and platforms. The Web of Things (WoT) tries to handle interoperability issues by describing interfaces and interaction patterns among things. Thanks to the models proposed by the WoT, it is possible to decouple the description of things from the protocols handling the communication and implementation strategies. This article proposes Digital Dice as an abstraction of IoT devices inspired by the concept of Digital Twin, but capable of leveraging the advantages of microservices architectures. We focus on the creation of Digital Dices from WoT models. A Digital Dice consists in different facets that are able to handle a particular aspect of a thing, hence different WoT descriptions models will result in different microservices related to that particular thing. An architecture to handle multiple Digital Dices and their replicas is also proposed.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital Twins, IoT, Microservices, Web of Things",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075874070}>, <IoT middleware: A survey on issues and enabling technologies, {eid: 85015164749}>, <None, {eid: 85063569479}>, <None, {eid: 84855216556}>, <None, {eid: 85075858318}>, <None, {eid: 85075893888}>, <A survey on complex event definition languages in multimedia sensor networks, {eid: 85009817262}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <Feature-based survey of model transformation approaches, {eid: 33748289548}>, <None, {eid: 85011536918}>, <Microservice-based IoT for smart buildings, {eid: 85021424248}>, <An open IoT framework based on microservices architecture, {eid: 85015161312}>, <Architecture of an interoperable IoT platform based on microservices, {eid: 84983616702}>, <Niflheim: An end-to-end middleware for applications on a multi-tier IoT infrastructure, {eid: 85046428883}>, <None, {eid: 85075896851}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/28/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85075856524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these new concepts is the Digital Twin, which recently started gaining momentum, and is related to creating a virtual copy of the physical system, providing a connection between the real and virtual systems to collect and analyze and simulate data in the virtual model to improve the performance of the real system. The benefits of using the digital twin approach is attracting significant attention and interest from research and industry communities in the last few years, and its importance will increase in the upcoming years. Having this in mind, this paper surveys and discusses the digital twin concept in the context of the 4th industrial revolution, particularly focusing the concept and functionalities, the associated technologies, the industrial applications and the research challenges. The applicability of the digital concept is illustrated by the virtualisation of an UR3 collaborative robot which used the V-REP simulation environment and the Modbus communication protocol.","Digital Twin, Industry 4.0, Simulation, Virtualisation",,,,,,,,"<Securing the future of German manufacturing industry: Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4. 0, {eid: 84926018987}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063}>, <None, {eid: 84940453073}>, <None, {eid: 85079049535}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Predictive manufacturing system-trends of next-generation production systems, {eid: 85079047775}>, <Product avatar as digital counterpart of a physical individual product: Literature review and implications in an aircraft, {eid: 84975691204}>, <Innovations in digital modelling for next generation manufacturing system design, {eid: 85018625620}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <None, {eid: 85070599797}>, <None, {eid: 85079035130}>, <Feasibility of an immersive digital twin, {eid: 85079069337}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Industry 4. 0 and the power of the digital twin, {eid: 85028754996}>, <Digital twins speed up the commissioning process, {eid: 85079053004}>, <None, {eid: 85079065371}>, <None, {eid: 85079052784}>, <None, {eid: 85079045921}>, <None, {eid: 85079055642}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85079066400}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,7/22/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079042229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry.

The rapid development of sensing technologies can collect real-time production data from shop floors, which provides more opportunities for making energy saving decisions about manufacturing systems. In this paper, a digital twin-based bidirectional operation framework is proposed to realize energy-efficient manufacturing systems. The data view, model view, and service view of a digital twin manufacturing system are formulated to describe the physical systems in virtual space, to perform simulation analysis, to make decisions, and to control the physical systems for various energy-saving purposes. For online energy-saving decisions about machines in serial manufacturing systems, an event-driven estimation method of an energy-saving window based on Max-plus Algebra is presented to put the target machine to sleep, considering real-time production data of a system segment. A practical, simplified automotive production line is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation experiments. Our method has no restriction on machine failure mode and predefined parameters for energy-saving decision of machines. The proposed approach has potential use in synchronous and asynchronous manufacturing systems.","Digital twin, Energy efficient operation, Manufacturing system, MATLAB-Simulink, Max-plus Algebra,

At the heart of the JARVIS architecture, a suite of software digital twins deployed in a Java EE environment supports runtime monitoring and control of the hierarchy of hardware configuration items of the system, capturing their composition and representing their failure modes through a reflection architectural pattern enabling agile adaptation to the evolution of configurations. Besides, analytic modules can be deployed as micro-services leveraging both the knowledge base provided by digital twins and the data flowing from the ingestion layer. This enables agile development of advanced monitoring and control services supporting maintainability and resilience. We describe the JARVIS architecture, outlining responsibilities and collaborations among its modules, and we provide details on the structure of representation of digital twins, showing how this is exploited in a data analytic agent providing an executable representation of fault trees associated with failure modes of configuration items.","Digital twins, Fault tree, I4.0 System of Systems",,,,,,,,"<A resilient internet of things architecture for smart cities, {eid: 84975127016}>, <None, {eid: 22944474960}>, <Message-oriented middleware, {eid: 84958896154}>, <None, {eid: 85072860344}>, <Chatbots as assistants: An architectural framework, {eid: 85091338262}>, <None, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Fault tree analysis, {eid: 29244449937}>, <None, {eid: 2942742234}>, <The relationship of system engineering to the project cycle, {eid: 85140979722}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <None, {eid: 0003880013}>, <Survey on NoSQL database, {eid: 84855888662}>, <None, {eid: 10044221068}>, <Future internet: The internet of things architecture, possible applications and key challenges, {eid: 84874174122}>, <None, {eid: 0004185878}>, <None, {eid: 85020536128}>, <The ORIS tool: Quantitative evaluation of non-markovian systems, {eid: 85111951095}>, <None, {eid: 85090205859}>, <Designing a resilient deployment and reconfiguration infrastructure for remotely managed cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84992709147}>, <Mil-std-498, {eid: 0005101949}>, <A survey of online failure prediction methods, {eid: 77950267881}>, <None, {eid: 0004101997}>, <Smart factories in industry 4.0: A review of the concept and of energy management approached in production based on the internet of things paradigm, {eid: 84988221092}>, <Smart cities built on resilient cloud computing and secure internet of things, {eid: 84883362337}>, <Digital twins-introduction to the special theme, {eid: 85072851467}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,9/17/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85072861981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry.","digital twin, internet of things, machine learning, petrochemical industry, production control

To parallelize event processing and produce near-real-Time insights over data streams, Digital Twin should be implemented based on an Event-Driven architecture. The Event-Driven architecture is loosely-coupled by its nature. One of the recent possible solutions for loose coupling system is a Microservice approach, a cohesive and independent process that interacts using messages. Stateless behavior is the nature of the microservice, but on the other hand, the vast majority of stream processing in Digital Twin imply stateful operations. Thus, in this paper, we propose a case-study of the possibility to use Apache Kafka Stream API (Kafka stream DSL) to build stateful microservice for real-Time manufacturing data analysis.

Since its first introduction in 2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of applications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial intelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.","Cyber-physical system, Digital twin, Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <A software-defined framework for the integrated management of smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 85039453232}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <None, {eid: 85081157087}>, <Integrated tool chain for model-based design of cyber-physical systems: The into-cps project, {eid: 84983000693}>, <Systemj: A gals language for system level design, {eid: 77957879241}>, <Grl: A specification language for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems, {eid: 84908701663}>, <Multiclock esterel, {eid: 84947206586}>, <The esterel synchronous programming language: Design, semantics, implementation, {eid: 0026953373}>, <None, {eid: 0003418449}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <None, {eid: 85081154629}>, <The temporal semantics of concurrent programs, {eid: 49149133038}>, <Automationml\-The glue for seamless automation engineering, {eid: 56349149489}>, <A structural approach to operational semantics, {eid: 2942572885}>, <None, {eid: 4644222521}>, <None, {eid: 0003654667}>, <Iopt-tools-A web based tool framework for embedded systems controller development using petri nets, {eid: 84898668110}>, <Online rotor mixed fault diagnosis way based on spectrum analysis of instantaneous power in squirrel cage induction motors, {eid: 4544373211}>, <Fault identification for robot manipulators, {eid: 27144485807}>, <Sampling-based motion planning with temporal goals, {eid: 77955794699}>, <Monitoring temporal properties of continuous signals, {eid: 27944453169}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/17/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081154595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UI provides sets of candidate policies in complex scenarios and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing sustainable and personalized solutions. The main characteristics of the proposed UI architecture are (a) fully multidisciplinary integration of city layers, (b) connection and evolution with the city, (c) integration of participative strategies to include 'human-oriented' information, and (d) modularity of application.","data lake management, data/model driven learning and reasoning, decision making, digital twins, know-how integration, multidisciplinary analysis and optimization, wireless sensing",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85015717813}>, <None, {eid: 84940878946}>, <Sensing as a service model for smart cities supported by Internet of Things, {eid: 84900641617}>, <None, {eid: 85076378858}>, <None, {eid: 84951746919}>, <None, {eid: 85076336538}>, <None, {eid: 85076340962}>, <Smart city digital twins, {eid: 85046124603}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Multidisciplinary design optimization: A survey of architectures, {eid: 84880847600}>, <Haddadi deep learning in mobile and wireless networking: A survey, {eid: 85071685550, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2019.2904897}>, <A cloud-iot platform for passive radio sensing: Challenges and application case studies, {eid: 85046773935}>, <Smart cities of the future, {eid: 84870948261}>, <A survey of urban reconstruction, {eid: 84884224099}>, <CityGML-Interoperable semantic 3D city models, {eid: 84861462606}>, <Shape 4.0: 3D shape modeling and processing using semantics, {eid: 84962647101}>, <Latency critical iot applications in 5g: Perspective on the design of radio interface and network architecture, {eid: 85012961108}>, <Distributed signal procesing for dense 5G IoT platforms: Networking, synchronization, interference detection and radio sensing, {eid: 85062217779}>, <Use of machine learning in the analysis of indoor elf mf exposure in children, {eid: 85064541238}>, <Stochastic dosimetry based on low rank tensor approximations for the assessment of children exposure to wlan source, {eid: 85057089256}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Multidisciplinary design optimization of a 3D composite hydrofoil via variable accuracy architecture, {eid: 85051654575}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/6/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85076337791,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These descriptions include static semantic structural description and dynamic time-series sensors data. Moreover, it is designed to be able to include data from various simulation tools, represented in the same way as sensors data. Thus, relying on these de- scriptions allow easy implementations of both monitoring and interaction tools that can the be interfaced with the Smart Building. Before the re- cent emergence of Smart Buildings, there was very few advantages in applying this concept to the field of construction and building manage- ment. Non-connected buildings don't produce real-time data, and can't be monitored nor operated from computer systems. But now that more and more buildings include IoT devices that allow them to expose data and services, the benefits of creating a Digital Twin to interact with the building, without interrogating the object itself, only by querying its Digital Twin, appears obvious. It then becomes crucial to be able to expose both a static description of the building's components (includ- ing IoT devices structural and functional description) and dynamic data that represent the evolution of the building's states over time.","BIM ontology IoT, Digital Twin, Sensor data management, Smart Building",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85086437236}>, <None, {eid: 84872740179}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. air force vehicles. 53rd AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, {eid: 84881426231}>, <The role of data fusion in predictive maintenance using digital twin, {eid: 85086473262}>, <None, {eid: 85086440460}>, <Ontology-based representation and reasoning in building construction cost estimation in China, {eid: 85006190085}>, <Integrating building information modeling and sensor observations using semantic web, {eid: 85086462153}>, <EXPRESS to OWL for contruction industry: Towards a recommendable and usable ifcOWL ontology, {eid: 84952362213}>, <None, {eid: 84962283259}>, <Reusing domain ontologies in linked building data: The case of building automation and control, {eid: 85045551983}>, <Managing interrelated project information in AEC Knowledge Graphs, {eid: 85074170098}>, <None, {eid: 85086470276}>, <None, {eid: 85086448642}>, <None, {eid: 85086444527}>, <None, {eid: 85086439068}>, <None, {eid: 85076017463}>, <None, {eid: 0041945343}>, <None, {eid: 85086457452}>, <None, {eid: 85086433803}>",,,CEUR-WS,,,1/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85086451841,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM.","Digital twin, industry 40, modeling, prediction, smart

A key enabler for the advances promised by CPPSs is the concept of a digital twin, which is the virtual representation of a real-world entity, or the physical twin. An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations. This architecture provides a service-based and real-time enabled infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration. To evaluate the architecture, it was implemented for a small, but typical, physical manufacturing system component.","Cyber physical systems (CPS), Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Internet of things (IoT), OPC, Tecnomatix",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85006080283}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <None, {eid: 84991364515}>, <Embedded digital twin for ARTI-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Analysis of OPC UA performances, {eid: 84884500285, doi: 10.1016/j.csi.2013.06.004}>, <Performance evaluation of OPC UA, {eid: 78650534914}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <None, {eid: 85087000373}>, <None, {eid: 85059093528}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85059079453}>, <None, {eid: 85086998540}>, <None, {eid: 85059077132}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models, {eid: 84928667408, doi: 10.3390/s150304837}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}>, <None, {eid: 79957551757}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2015.08.004}>, <Review on cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85010065711, doi: 10.1109/JAS.2017.7510349}>, <None, {eid: 85086992184}>, <None, {eid: 85086984554}>, <None, {eid: 85056624416}>, <None, {eid: 85059098452}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.06.005}>, <Cyber physical process monitoring systems, {eid: 84949993153, doi: 10.1007/s10845-015-1180-z}>, <Round-trip delay estimation in OPC UA ServerClient communication channel, {eid: 85009776803, doi: 10.5755/j01.eie.22.6.17229}>, <None, {eid: 85076280430}>, <None, {eid: 85086991713}>, <None, {eid: 85053398467}>, <Literature review of Industry 4.0 and related technologies, {eid: 85078567359}>, <Documentation and records: Harmonized GMP requirements, {eid: 80052228922, doi: 10.4103/0975-1483.80303}>, <None, {eid: 85086985933}>, <Integrating the digital twin of a shop floor conveyor in the manufacturing control system, {eid: 85070650523}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Cybersecurity Considerations for Industrie 4.0, {eid: 85070638283}>, <A six-layer architecture for digital twins with aggregation, {eid: 85070603892, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-27477-1_13}>, <A Centralized Support Infrastructure (CSI) to Manage CPS Digital Twin, towards the Synchronization between CPS Deployed on the Shopfloor and Their Digital Representation, {eid: 85076290432}>, <Multi-agent system architectures for collaborative prognostics, {eid: 85068194472, doi: 10.1007/s10845-019-01478-9}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.040}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <None, {eid: 85086988006}>, <None, {eid: 85097986136}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Digital twins and cyber–physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049, doi: 10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>",,,Springer,,,8/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85076271545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent redefinition of the digital twin from the digital replica of a physical asset to the replica of a living or nonliving entity has increased its potential. The digital twin not only disrupts industrial processes, but also expands the domain of health and well-being towards fostering smart healthcare services in smart cities. In this paper, we propose an ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework architecture for health and well-being. This framework encompasses the process of data collection from personal health devices, the analysis of this data, and conveying the feedback to the user in a loop cycle. The framework proposes a solution to include not only X73 compliant devices, but also noncompliant health devices, by interfacing them with an X73 wrapper module as we explain in this paper. Besides, we propose a configurable X73 mobile application, designed to work with any X73 compliant device. We designed and implemented the proposed framework, and the X73 mobile app, and conducted an experiment as a proof of concept of the digital twin in the domain of health and well-being in smart cities. The experiment shows promising results and the potential of benefiting from the proposed framework, by gaining insights on the health and well-being of individuals, and providing feedback to the individual and caregiver.","artificial intelligence, data analysis, data collection, Digital twin, health, ISO/IEEE 11073, physical activity, standards, user feedback, user interaction, wearables,

Industry 4.0 applications improve production efficiency, product quality, etc., by using Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Existing industry 4.0 application development approaches are centered on commercial IoT platforms that provide siloed development and runtime environments (leading to vendor lockdown) and only support individual sensors and actuators instead of entire machines. Therefore, Industry 4.0 applications need to construct representations of complex machines from such basic elements, which is a costly, error-prone, inefficient hindering portability across machines and plants. This paper proposes Cyber Twins, a comprehensive solution for efficient Industry 4.0 application development, testing, and portability. The Cyber Twins solution includes a model for machine representation and services that facilitate Industry 4.0 application development.

Several of these features or parts of them can be implemented employing existing systems storing product data. However, to create a digital twin, these data being scattered to different systems is needed to be merged. For merging data and straightforward linking of these systems, this paper proposes a Data Link. The Data Link offers a single interface to access the systems via an API (Application Programming Interface) gateway and makes all data of the physical product available and accessible. In addition, it stores metadata about the systems and offers a user interface that allows searching the system that contains the required piece of information or implements the needed feature. The Data Link was implemented for an industrial overhead crane bringing operational data, control, and CAD (computer-aided design) models behind a single interface. The example implementation indicated that the Data Link based architecture for digital twins allows easy implementation of digital twins by using existing systems.","cyber-physical systems, Data link, digital twin, industrial communication, industrial internet of things",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Digital twin the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-32156-1-5}>, <Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control over Mobile Networks: Application of Remote Surgery, {eid: 85062238969, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897018}>, <A feature-based framework for structuring industrial digital twins, {eid: 85077802084, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950507}>, <Towards digital twins cloud platform: Microservices and computational workflows to rule a smart factory, {eid: 85058345420, doi: 10.1145/3147213.3149234}>, <Processes, motivations, and issues for migrating to microservices architectures: An empirical investigation, {eid: 85038613047, doi: 10.1109/MCC.2017.4250931}>, <Stateful stream processing for digital twins: Microservice-based kafka stream DSL, {eid: 85079071242, doi: 10.1109/SIBIRCON48586.2019.8958367}>, <Robust Digital twin compositions for industry 4.0 smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 85058969908, doi: 10.1109/EDOCW.2018.00021}>, <Platform for industrial Internet and digital twin focused education, research, and innovation: Ilmatar the overhead crane, {eid: 85050503484, doi: 10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355217}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <DRAFT Modeling, Simulation, information technology &processing roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <Digital twins for industrial applications, {eid: 85086457062}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953499}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <A state-of-The-art survey of digital twin: Techniques, engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation perspectives, {eid: 85075384583, doi: 10.1007/s10845-019-01512-w}>, <Digital dices: Towards the integration of cyber-physical systems merging the Web of things and microservices, {eid: 85075856524, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-32065-2-14}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: An IoT-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602, doi: 10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387665}>, <Digital twin Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <An API development model for digital twins, {eid: 85073881298, doi: 10.1109/QRSC.2019.00103}>, <File-and API-based interoperability of digital twins by model transformation: An IIoT case study using asset administration shell, {eid: 85087587581, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2020.07.004}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.197}>, <None, {eid: 85184714568}>, <None, {eid: 85184709031}>, <None, {eid: 85100135883}>, <None, {eid: 85184694126}>, <None, {eid: 85119264169}>, <None, {eid: 85184683721}>, <Nosturidatan analysointi ja visualisointi IoT-alustalla, {eid: 85100204129}>, <Open sensor manager for IIoT, {eid: 85092275905, doi: 10.3390/jsan9020030}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,1/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85183523666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While autonomous driving on public roads still faces various technical and legal challenges, within a distribution center, which is a confined area, some of these restrictions do not apply. Therefore, distribution centers can be the first environment where the autonomous driving of trucks is possible. A distribution center is a closed environment with no, or minimal generic traffic, where the trucks have relatively low speeds, short stopping distance and layout precisely known. Dedicated sensors locate the trucks. This paper addresses the mentioned aspects of driving in the distribution centers describing the necessary steps taken for the design, implementation, and testing of a VSE for a distribution center, and a DT of an autonomously driving truck. The development of the VSE is based on the integration of a SysML modeling tool – IBM Rhapsody, MATLAB Simulink, and Unity Game Engine using a Model-Based System Engineering approach. The paper also presents the test and the validation of a driving scenario used in a distribution center, using the TruckLab setup of the Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. The VSE and the DT showed considerable potential as testing and validation tools for automotive engineers, making it possible to define driving test scenarios for different types of tractor and trailer combinations.","Autonomous driving truck, Digital Twin, Distribution center, DTIL (Digital-Twin-In-Loop), MIL (Model-In-Loop), Model-Based System Engineering, SysML, Virtual Simulation Environment",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85082195349}>, <None, {eid: 85028343856}>, <None, {eid: 85091505499}>, <None, {eid: 85091525026}>, <None, {eid: 85091528540}>, <Towards an agent-based modelling approach for the evaluation of dynamic usage of urban distribution centres, {eid: 84885830000}>, <None, {eid: 85091505351}>, <None, {eid: 85091531970}>, <None, {eid: 85091523893}>, <None, {eid: 85091476670}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <None, {eid: 85091494074}>, <None, {eid: 85029753160}>, <None, {eid: 84863580082}>, <None, {eid: 85091511715}>, <None, {eid: 85091525955}>, <None, {eid: 85091482482}>, <None, {eid: 85046678211}>, <Development of a virtual environment and supervisory control for TruckLab, D&C 2018.031, {eid: 85091509288}>, <Simulation environment for real-time applications 3D visualisation/simulation environment for testing real-time electronic control units, {eid: 84893429799}>, <Virtual reality to implement driving simulation for combining CAN BUS and automotive sensors, {eid: 85056252957}>, <A diminished reality simulation for driver-car interaction with transparent cockpits, {eid: 85018443721}>, <Interactive and virtual/mixed reality applications for mechatronics education developed in unity engine, {eid: 85050870375}>, <Unity 3D production and environmental perception vehicle simulation platform, {eid: 85015155426}>, <CARLA: an open urban driving simulator, {eid: 85049891073}>, <AirSim: High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles, {eid: 85107023363}>, <None, {eid: 76249122848}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85091525811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.As the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining ground and becoming increasingly popular in smart city applications such as smart energy, smart buildings, smart factories, smart transportation, smart farming, and smart healthcare, the digital twin concept is evolving as complementary to its counter physical part. While an object is on the move, its operational and surrounding environmental parameters are collected by an edge computing device for local decision. A virtual replica of such object (digital twin) is based in the cloud computing platform and hosts the real-time physical object data, 2D and 3D models, historical data, and bill of materials (BOM) for further processing, analytics, and visualization. This paper proposes an end-to-end digital twin conceptual model that represents its complementary physical object from the ground to the cloud. The paper presents the proposed digital twin model’s multi-layers, namely, physical, communication, virtual space, data analytic and visualization, and application as well as the overlapping security layer. The hardware and software technologies that are used in building such a model will be explained in detail. A use case will be presented to show how the layers collect, exchange, and process the physical object data from the ground to the cloud.","Big data analytics, Digital twins, Internet of Things, Smart cities",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <A holistic methodology for development of Real-Time Digital Twins, {eid: 85089074205}>, <ANGEL: An Intelligent Digital Twin Framework for Microgrid Security, {eid: 85080914168}>, <A Digital Twin Framework for Industry 4.0 Enabling Next-Gen Manufacturing, {eid: 85084958987}>, <Characterising the Digital Twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Digital Twin in the IoT Context: A Survey on Technical Features, Scenarios, and Architectural Models, {eid: 85087488936}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85101789242}>, <A digital twin for smart farming, {eid: 85082682869}>, <Towards a digital twin for manufacturing processes: Applicability on laser welding, {eid: 85089063716}>, <None, {eid: 85084989009}>, <Smart objects as building blocks for the Internet of things, {eid: 75449104170}>, <Architecture for Digital Twin implementation focusing on Industry 4.0, {eid: 85084606914}>, <None, {eid: 85093826169}>, <None, {eid: 85025690543}>, <None, {eid: 85093851015}>, <Raspberry Pi HATs, pHATS & GPIO, {eid: 85093856443}>, <A Review on Mobile Technologies: 3G, 4G and 5G, {eid: 85034656530}>, <A survey on 5G: The next generation of mobile communication, {eid: 84958102458}>, <3D Design Software|3D Modeling on the Web SketchUp, {eid: 85093858834}>, <None, {eid: 85029860566}>, <A Survey of Discretization Techniques: Taxonomy and Empirical Analysis in Supervised Learning, {eid: 84874613998}>, <Anomaly Detections for Manufacturing Systems Based on Sensor Data—Insights into Two Challenging Real-World Production Settings, {eid: 85076365280}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <A fuzzy logic–based warning system for patient’s classification, {eid: 85071282152}>",,,MDPI AG,,,10/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85093837667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Six-Layer Architecture for Digital Twins with Aggregation (SLADTA) is a framework for a digital twin suitable for complex systems with a large network of devices. An important part of this architecture is using an asynchronous, secure and vendor-neutral communication protocol suitable for a large network of devices. MQTT is here evaluated as a communication protocol for a digital twin data pipeline based of SLADTA. The evaluation includes a case study for a simulated heliostat field, using MQTT through Google Cloud Platform’s (GCP) IoT Core broker and the accompanying Cloud Pub/Sub service. For comparison, the case study also uses MQTT through the Eclipse Mosquitto broker. The case study demonstrates the potential of MQTT in SLADTA for complex systems’ digital twins.","Digital Twin, MQTT, SLADTA",,,,,,,,"<Comparison of digital twin development in manufacturing and maritime domains, {eid: 85070640016}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <None, {eid: 85103441838}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Predictive big data analytics and cyber physical systems for TES systems, {eid: 85048640662}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A six-layer architecture for digital twins with aggregation, {eid: 85070603892}>, <Choice of effective messaging protocols for IoT systems: MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP, {eid: 85040112745}>, <None, {eid: 85103470213}>, <A six-layer architecture for the digital twin: A manufacturing case study implementation, {eid: 85089250665}>, <None, {eid: 85076639395}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85103467740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

To evaluate this claim, this paper selects an architecture of the Digital Twin and realizes it on the basis of an application scenario for a cyber-physical manufacturing system. A case study is used to test the reconfiguration of a manufacturing system by comparing two different methods, one without and one with use of the Digital Twin. In this paper, the process steps of both reconfigurations are described and discussed in detail and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the reconfiguration results is presented. Finally, this paper gives an outlook on future research on intelligent automation of manufacturing systems using the Digital Twin.","architecture of Digital Twin, assistance systems, Digital Twin, reconfiguration",,,,,,,,"<Consistency check to synchronize the Digital Twin of manufacturing automation based on anchor points, {eid: 85049592057, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.166}>, <A concept in synchronization of virtual production system with real factory based on anchor-point method, {eid: 85044658638, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2017.12.168}>, <An architecture of an Intelligent Digital Twin in a Cyber-Physical Production System, {eid: 85073869890, doi: 10.1515/auto-2019-0039}>, <Synchronisierung von digitalen Modellen, {eid: 85053283464, doi: 10.17560/atp.v59i07-08.1902}>, <None, {eid: 0142208258}>, <None, {eid: 77957342423}>, <None, {eid: 85086378948}>, <None, {eid: 85086400007}>, <None, {eid: 85086377816}>, <None, {eid: 77954350348, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-04674-2}>, <Interoperabilität von Engineering-Werkzeugen: Konzepte und Empfehlungen für den Datenaustausch zwischen Engineering-Werkzeugen, {eid: 80053230418, doi: 10.1524/auto.2011.0938}>, <None, {eid: 85086371808}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <None, {eid: 85073870095, doi: 10.3139/9783446446496.fm}>, <None, {eid: 85086385985}>, <None, {eid: 85055721125, doi: 10.1145/3241403.3241417}>, <Next Generation Digital Twin: An Ecosystem for Mechatronic Systems?, {eid: 85077494977, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.685}>, <None, {eid: 84946685780, doi: 10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005144}>",,,De Gruyter Oldenbourg,,,6/25/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85086369671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.","artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, Digital twin, hybrid analysis and modeling, machine learning",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85028076136}>, <None, {eid: 85081081436}>, <None, {eid: 85081090716}>, <Experimentable digital twins Streamlining simulation-based systems engineering for industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <None, {eid: 85081092982}>, <Actigraphy as an objective intra-individual marker of activity patterns in acute-phase bipolar disorder: A case series, {eid: 85056238980}>, <Computer modelling to personalize bioengineered heart valves, {eid: 85047357324}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control over mobile networks: Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Advances in organon-A-chip engineering, {eid: 85051246777}>, <Organoid-on-A-chip and body-on-A-chip systems for drug screening and disease modeling, {eid: 84981734428}>, <None, {eid: 85081092828}>, <Health care in the cyberspace: Medical cyber-physical system and digital twin challenges, {eid: 85081088828}>, <Challenges and research directions in medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155167716}>, <Medical cyber-physical systems: A survey, {eid: 85043473992}>, <Emerging security mechanisms for medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84976524779}>, <A survey on wireless body area networks, {eid: 79951723271}>, <US economic sensitivity to weather variability, {eid: 79961049711}>, <The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction, {eid: 84940937976}>, <Urban finescale forecasting reveals weather conditions with unprecedented detail, {eid: 85029851316}>, <Using smartphones for monitoring atmospheric tides, {eid: 85046743732}>, <Private observations improve MET Norways operational weather forecasts, {eid: 85081078971}>, <A hybrid ETKF 3DVAR data assimilation scheme for the WRF model.

To acquire the service information of each general part under the environment of high temperature and serious oil pollution for predicting remaining life and preventative maintenance, a digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability system for general parts in continuous casting machine is proposed. First, the systematic architecture of proposed approach is given in detail, where a typical five-layer model for digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability is established. Second, the Web-based 3D visualization monitoring for continuous casting machine is achieved by using lightweight 3D twin model. After that, an assembly model based on polychromatic sets is built for expressing and describing the assembly relationships and assembly process of general parts. Meanwhile, an encoding rule for part and position is put forward by considering assembly position information. On the basis of that, the general parts with total process information are traced in the service life cycle. Finally, digital twin-based 3D visualization monitoring and traceability prototype system is developed and implemented, where the experiment cases verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.","3D twin model, 3D visualization monitoring, Digital twin, Polychromatic sets, Traceability",,,,,,,,"<Towards a Cost-Effective and Reusable Traceability System.

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,12/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099750826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure. A proof-of-concept shows the application of Semantic Web technologies for instantiating the proposed GDTA for a use case of a Packed-Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES).","Cyber–physical system, Digital Twin, Industrial energy systems, Industry 4.0, Semantic web, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<Reviewing literature on digitalization, business model innovation, and sustainable industry: Past achievements and future promises, {eid: 85059981198}>, <A Complex View of Industry 4.0, {eid: 84977470136}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <None, {eid: 85055039994}>, <Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Reference Framework for Digital Twins within Cyber–Physical Systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <Digital Twins for Industrial Applications.

Among other, the two key state-of-the-art concepts in Industry 4.0, are Industrial IoT (IIoT) and digital twins. IIoT facilitates real-time data acquisition, processing and analytics over large amount of sensor data streams produced by sensors installed within a smart factory, while the 'digital twin' concept aims to enable smart factories via the digital replication or representation of physical machines, processes, people in cyber-space. This paper explores the capability of present-state open-source platforms to collectively achieve digital twin capabilities, including IoT real-time data acquisition, virtual representation, analytics, and visualisation. The aim of this work is to 'close the gap' between research and implementation, through a collective open source IoT and Digital Twin architecture. The performance of the open-source architecture in this work, is demonstrated in a use-case utilising industry 'open data', and is bench-marked with universal testing tools.","Benchmark, Digital Twins, Industry 4.0, IoT, Open-Source",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <An open source approach to the design and implementation of digital twins for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85064532610}>, <Chapter four-the industry use cases for the digital twin idea, {eid: 85076597178}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85101788388}>, <Combining eclipse iot technologies for a rpi3-rover along with eclipse kuksa, {eid: 85044542931}>, <Representing industrial data streams in digital twins using semantic labeling, {eid: 85062594541}>, <From raw data to smart manufacturing: Ai and semantic web of things for industry 4. 0, {eid: 85055470567}>, <None, {eid: 85076532339}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/3/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85087431079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT. DT is a virtual and authoritative representation of physical manufacturing resource, since DT includes various models and manufacturing big data of resource. The proposed architecture is illustrated in detail as follows: (1) physical layer, (2) network layer, (3) virtual layer, and (4) application layer. A case of expert fault diagnose for aircraft engine is presented using the proposed information fusion in the architecture. Secondly, this paper proposes an approach of information modeling for CPPS based on AutomationML. Various manufacturing services can be encapsulated and defined in the standardized format (AutomationML), and then the corresponding virtual manufacturing resources (DTs) will be integrated into CPPS. Finally, this paper describes a case of information modeling for blisk machining and demonstrates the modeling approach in real-life scenarios for support manufacturing resource sharing via DT. Furthermore, the conclusion and further work is briefly summarized.","AutomationML, Digital twin, Information modeling, Intelligent manufacturing, Production system",,,,,,,,"<From conception phase up

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Injection molding, Model-driven development, Reference architecture",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Digital behavioral twins for safe connected cars, {eid: 85056832496}>, <Machinability assessment of inconel 718 by factorial design of experiment coupled with response surface methodology, {eid: 0343168164}>, <Practical applications of Taguchi method for optimization of processing parameters for plastic injection moulding: A retrospective review, {eid: 84923316802}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Constance: an intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <Injection molding setup by means of machine learning based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85072959161}>, <Combined learning processes for injection moulding based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85097342280}>, <Flexibilisation of injection moulding manufacture through digitisation, {eid: 85086233825}>, <Approaches of self-optimising systems in manufacturing, {eid: 85149036760}>, <None, {eid: 85086227181}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85054903830}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <None, {eid: 84905811248}>, <Abstraction and refinement in hierarchically decomposable and underspecified CPS-architectures, {eid: 85052702289}>, <Jenseits menschlicher fähigkeiten.

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.","adaptive control, Digital twin, DTSS, dynamic context management, GEMINIS, IoT, megamodel, MIAC, models at runtime, MRAC, reference model, self-adaptive",,,,,,,,"<Towards architecting digital twin-pervaded systems, {eid: 85074976546}>, <Models@run, {eid: 85008066028}>, <White paper: Vantiq digital twin architecture, {eid: 85093084505}>, <Digital twin requirements in the context of industry 4. 0, {eid: 85058501104}>, <Dimensions of digital twin applications-a literature review, {eid: 85084019743}>, <Society 5. 0: Aiming for a new human-centered society, {eid: 85074406779}>, <Digital twin: Manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85006339863}>, <None, {eid: 7744244490}>, <Reference framework for digital twins within cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <None, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in iiot systems, {eid: 85055721125}>, <None, {eid: 84904816002}>, <None, {eid: 84975840997}>, <Cyberphysical systems: The next computing revolution, {eid: 77956217277}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Towards continuous monitoring in personalized healthcare through digital twins, {eid: 85081157740}>, <None, {eid: 85093095149}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85069755419}>, <None, {eid: 85093093059}>, <None, {eid: 84883567578}>, <The role of models and megamodels at runtime, {eid: 79957665127}>, <The emergence of intelligent enterprises: From cps to cpss, {eid: 77956341661}>, <Ubiquitous computing, {eid: 84942211371}>, <Cyber-physical control over wireless sensor and actuator networks with packet loss, {eid: 85093074433}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,6/27/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85093092203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a new approach of service publication and discovery based on the philosophy of ""product catalogs"". In this new approach, entities are equivalent to products in typical products catalogs. We conceptualize an entity registry where each entry constitutes to its collection of remote services. For logical abstraction of entities, we utilize the concept of Digital Twin (DT). To support our objective, we present a reference DT architecture that virtualizes entities, exposes all its functionalities as services, and offers a remote programmable instance to invoke the services directly from application code. To publish and discover DTs, we propose a novel framework, OpenDT. This framework enables entity owners to publish DTs and allow users to discover them for creating mashups and applications using DT services. It also allows developers to create composite DTs that consists of other DTs for large and complex entities. To evaluate OpenDT, we implement a cyber-manufacturing testbed comprising of multiple machining tools and their DTs. Case validations from testbed show excellent efficiency of DT-driven entity publication and discovery.","Catalogs, Digital Twin, Discovery, OpenDT, Publication, Registry, Services",,,,,,,,"<A survey on web service discovery approaches, {eid: 85097397640}>, <Service discovery techniques in Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 85076752925}>, <A Survey on Service Discovery Mechanism, {eid: 85099207557}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Principled design of the modern Web architecture, {eid: 84963744744}>, <A Conceptual Architecture and Model for Smart Manufacturing Relying on Service-Based Digital Twins, {eid: 85072770651}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <MTComm based virtualization and integration of physical machine operations with digital-twins in cyber-physical manufacturing cloud, {eid: 85051552529}>, <A dynamic web service registry framework for mobile environments, {eid: 85008450467}>, <Publication and Discovery of Things in the Internet of Things, {eid: 85099263172}>, <Virtual production lines design for back-end semiconductor manufacturing systems, {eid: 0042386739}>, <Cyber-physical manufacturing cloud: Architecture, virtualization, communication, and testbed, {eid: 85018178147}>, <Identifying Architectural Design Trade-Offs in Service Registry Features, {eid: 85022206166}>, <A distributed architecture for efficient Web service discovery, {eid: 84958047794}>, <A novel distributed registry approach for efficient and resilient service discovery in megascale distributed systems, {eid: 85055140617}>, <A Highly Available Replicated Service Registry for Service Discovery in a Highly Dynamic Deployment Infrastructure, {eid: 85054001632}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/18/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099195270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technology is advancing fast and helping industries to obtain more and more detailed data about their processes and equipment. In fact, the possibility to monitor and control each part of the process is a strong base on which a more intelligent and focused control can be built. Technology advance brings innovation and the possibility to manage the production in terms of”near future” through AI prediction and decision-making support. Forecasting demands and planning production, optimizing process by reducing costs and improving efficiency without corrupting the quality of the product is a big challenge at the plant level. In this paper, a flexible, scalable architecture for intelligent digital twin realization called REPLICA has been proposed to cope with such problem and help industries to advance and discover possible optimizations. This architecture sits on top of two European projects, namely CPSwarm and RECLAIM, where their contribution focus on distributed simulation and optimization, and Adaptive Sensorial Networks, correspondingly. As a validation process, a hypothetical use case is presented, detailing the key differentiating points and benefits of the proposed architecture.","AI, Digital Twin, Fault Diagnosis, IoT, Predictive Maintenance",,,,,,,,"<About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <A simulation-based digital twin for model-driven health monitoring and predictive maintenance of an automotive braking system, {eid: 85050724272}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Industrial artificial intelligence for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 85053749537}>, <An architecture of an intelligent digital twin in a cyber-physical production system, {eid: 85073869890}>, <Methodology for enabling digital twin using advanced physics-based modelling in predictive maintenance, {eid: 85068434420}>, <Integration of digital twin and deep learning in cyber-physical systems: towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85088873643}>, <A digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning, {eid: 85062237403}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <Knowledge-driven digital twin manufacturing cell towards intelligent manufacturing, {eid: 85079752230}>, <None, {eid: 85069768676}>, <A hybrid predictive maintenance approach for cnc machine tool driven by digital twin, {eid: 85082683374}>, <The cpswarm technology for designing swarms of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096358433}>, <Distributed simulation for evolutionary design of swarms of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096363553}>, <Continuous maintenance system for optimal scheduling based on real-time machine monitoring, {eid: 85057277734}>, <None, {eid: 85096353185}>, <Formal modeling of function block applications running in iec 61499 execution runtime, {eid: 50149107443}>, <Framework for distributed industrial automation and control (4diac), {eid: 54849420309}>, <Finalintegration of external simulators, d6.7, {eid: 85096357210}>",,,CEUR-WS,,,9/17/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096361851,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But only virtual workshop cannot realize the interaction of the physical world and virtual world required for smart manufacturing. The digital twin workshop is a useful way to realize the fusion of virtual workshop and physical workshop, and optimizes the activities. This paper studies the concept of digital twin workshop, and digital twin workshop is divided into three parts: virtual workshop, physical workshop and digital twin engine. At the same time, this paper emphatically analyzes the definition and function of the digital twin engine in the digital twin workshop system, and also proposes an architecture for building the digital twin workshop based on the virtual workshop models. Finally, taking the implementation of digital twin workshop of an intelligent manufacturing unit as an example, the effectiveness and functionality of the digital twin workshop of an intelligent manufacturing unit are verified based on the digital twin engine.","Digital twin, Digital twin workshop Digital twin engine, Virtual workshop",,,,,,,,"<Research on production life cycle based on digital clues and digital twinsJ, {eid: 85068455768}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineeringJ, {eid: 85018723536}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshopJ, {eid: 85056967567}>, <None, {eid: 85094673710}>, <Stochastic reduced basis methodsJ, {eid: 0036684042}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturingJ, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floorJ, {eid: 85031730152}>, <Real time monitoring of surface roughness by acoustic emissions in cnc turningJ, {eid: 84874301757}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739, doi: 10.1007/s12652-018-0881-5}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,8/25/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85094669307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed architecture uses the holonic manufacturing paradigm by decoupling the decision layer from the control one. The decision layer uses intelligent agents that reconfigure optimally in real time the resource allocation and scheduling of operations on products at batch level; also, the resource health is monitored continuously. Decisions are taken in the high layer of the MES based on real time machine learning algorithms that predict resource performances and QoS influencing usage costs, classify and cluster resource states to predict anomalies in behaviours and prevent resource failures. The distributed control layer keeps reality awareness during production by using digital twins replicated for all resources. Data is collected in real time streams from physical resource and process twins, aggregated in time series and sent to the intelligent agents in the cloud without delaying production.

Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert' judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value determining method by accurate expert scoring.","Analytic hierarchy process, Complex networks, Digital twin, Evidence theory, Fuzzy number, Intelligent manufacturing, PROMETHEE II, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Report of the world commission on environment and development, {eid: 58149372152}>, <Perspectives of environmental education and environmental management in Bangladesh and their sustainability, {eid: 85102763751}>, <Coordinates of the accounting in Romania.

Engineering and monitoring interactive digital twins currently demands integrating different piecemeal technologies that effectively hinders their application and deployment. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived. We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing.","Digital Twins, Information systems, Model-driven software engineering, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <Model-based generation of enterprise information systems, {eid: 85048362638}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A multi agent system architecture to implement collaborative learning for social industrial assets, {eid: 85052888258}>, <None, {eid: 85086228557}>, <Systematic language extension mechanisms for the MontiArc architecture description language, {eid: 85025126026}>, <Architectural programming with MontiArcAutomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <A distributed ledger approach to digital twin secure data sharing, {eid: 85069511065}>, <None, {eid: 85065215650}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Continuous transition from model-driven prototype to full-size real-world enterprise information systems, {eid: 85096970269}>, <None, {eid: 85069873204}>, <Automatic synthesis from UML/ MARTE models using channel semantics, {eid: 84874155522}>, <Digital twins as a modern approach to design of industrial processes, {eid: 85064730379}>, <None, {eid: 0003712808}>, <Visualising the digital twin using web services and augmented reality, {eid: 85012932205}>, <A domain model-driven approach for producing user interfaces to multi-platform information systems, {eid: 84876552310}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <None, {eid: 85097405814}>, <None, {eid: 33748331276}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart shop-floor, {eid: 85056967567}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,11/3/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85097375593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS's behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models""are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.","Digital Twin Engineering, Model-Driven Engineering, Reference Architecture",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-physische systeme, {eid: 84887049793}>, <Guest editorial industry 4.0-prerequisites and visions, {eid: 84959163360}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Towards liquid models: An evolutionary modeling approach, {eid: 85010424048}>, <Model-based generation of run-time data collection systems exploiting automationml, {eid: 85055572325}>, <Model-integrating software components, {eid: 84921340824}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in iiot systems, {eid: 85062630045}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Guest editors introduction: Model-driven engineering, {eid: 33344465743}>, <On the unification power of models, {eid: 19644394108}>, <Model-driven runtime state identification, {eid: 85093359940}>, <EMF-REST: Generation of RESTful APIs from models, {eid: 84975864604}>, <The role of the Industry 4.0 asset administration shell and the digital twin during the life cycle of a plant, {eid: 85044475829}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Automatic reverse engineering of interaction models from system logs, {eid: 85074212135}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,9/8/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85093356602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS. In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow.

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.","Building information modeling (BIM), Digital twin, Process mining, Time series analysis",,,,,,,,"<Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid:

Once it is deployed, a critical system cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to introduce security straight from the early development phases. However, the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often costly or impossible. To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view in the system’s architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical infrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodology to a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating the system security of the obtained solution.","C-ITS, Cyber security, Digital twin, Threat modeling",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85119832588}>, <The industry use cases for the digital twin idea, Chap. 4, {eid: 85119865810}>, <Cyberfactory1-securing the industry 4.0 with cyber-ranges and digital twins, {eid: 85050025311}>, <A digital twin-based privacy enhancement mechanism for the automotive industry, {eid: 85065981827}>, <Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center, {eid: 85117542440}>, <Towards security-aware virtual environments for digital twins, {eid: 85056740434}>, <Digital twins for cyber-physical systems security: State of the art and outlook, {eid: 85149551859}>, <None, {eid: 85119822859}>, <None, {eid: 85119853169}>, <None, {eid: 85119872997}>, <None, {eid: 85119824432}>, <None, {eid: 85119828506}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85119885703}>, <None, {eid: 85119833834}>, <None, {eid: 85119825364}>, <None, {eid: 85119859181}>, <A meta language for threat modeling and attack simulations, {eid: 85063280304}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Analyzing the effectiveness of attack countermeasures in a SCADA system, {eid: 85019036296}>, <None, {eid: 85119859339}>, <A state-of-the-art survey of Digital Twin: Techniques, engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation perspectives, {eid: 85075384583}>, <None, {eid: 85103470058}>, <None, {eid: 85111413823}>, <None, {eid: 85119851496}>, <None, {eid: 85119868048}>, <Change impact analysis of feature models, {eid: 84866719344}>, <None, {eid: 85119869508}>, <The Open Group: Reference Architectures and Open Group Standards for the Internet of Things-Four Internet of, {eid: 85119858124}>, <United States Department of Transportation.

Published by Elsevier B.V.In the realm of the fourth Industrial Revolution, digital technologies are constantly integrated in Manufacturing processes in order to improve system reliability, monitor processes accurately and ultimately optimize processes. In order to tackle these issues, advanced simulation techniques such as Digital Twins (DT) have to be developed. Further to that, modern manufacturing systems are based on the integration of non-conventional processes, such as Additive Manufacturing (AM). Therefore, in this research work a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) DT is designed and developed, integrating quality assessment modules. Furthermore, a database has been modelled in an attempt to monitor all the experiment results. Additional modules have also been created and integrated, such as compensating the effects of printing, as well as immersive interfaces enabling the users to control and monitor the machine state remotely. Consequently, one of the key concepts of this paper is the design of the information flow between the above-mentioned modules for optimizing the FDM process parameters, and thus minimize time and resources caused by human error. The implementation of the proposed framework is based on the integration of suitable communication channels.","Additive Manufacturing, Digital Twin, Fused Deposition Modeling, Mixed Reality",,,,,,,,"<Additive Manufacturing Technologies, {eid: 84934874782}>, <Additive manufacturing methods and modelling approaches: A critical review, {eid: 84959221528}>, <None, {eid: 85089930702}>, <Simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems: State of the art and new trends, {eid: 85068546250}>, <None, {eid: 85111002566}>, <Addressing the challenges for the industrial application of additive manufacturing: Towards a hybrid solution, {eid: 85058347197}>, <A real-time adaptive look-ahead speed control algorithm for FDM-based additive manufacturing technology with Hbot kinematic system, {eid: 85069436110}>, <Shrinkage compensation of holes via shrinkage of interior structure in FDM process, {eid: 85028866111}>, <Optimization of fused deposition modeling process parameters: A review of current research and future prospects, {eid: 84938827647}>, <Fully resolved numerical simulations of fused deposition modeling.

Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems.","Architecture, Controlled environment agriculture, Digital twin, Optimization, Productivity",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85087340838}>, <None, {eid: 85042563333}>, <Temperature increase reduces global yields of major crops in four independent estimates, {eid: 85028561747}>, <None, {eid: 85073331006}>, <None, {eid: 71649088197}>, <Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity, {eid: 77957341228}>, <Controlled environment food production for urban agriculture, {eid: 85077971423}>, <Review of energy efficiency in controlled environment agriculture, {eid: 85100551408}>, <Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment agriculture: A transition to plant factories and urban agriculture, {eid: 85042150131}>, <None, {eid: 34250189461}>, <Future food-production systems: Vertical farming and controlled-environment agriculture, {eid: 85042492387}>, <None, {eid: 85082256588}>, <Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms, {eid: 85089611838}>, <Lettuce growth and quality optimization in a plant factory, {eid: 84973598861}>, <Plant factories versus greenhouses: Comparison of resource use efficiency, {eid: 85034756098}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

In manufacturing, a digital-twin visualization architecture is to solve the human-machine interaction problem that concerns digital-twin modeling on the Cyber-Physical (C-P) side and on the Human-Cyber side. Although there are many related research and applications, there lacks attention in terms of full life cycle functional services and lightweight architecture. This paper presents a general architecture of digital-twin visualization for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). How the digital-twin C-P modeling of multi-source heterogeneous information can be described is investigated and how the 3D visualized human-machine interaction with digital-twin scenario information is explored in the proposed architecture. Besides, the visualization method of high-value information, relating to the life cycle planning, design, debugging and service stages, is studied and discussed thoroughly. Also, a digital-twin modeling concept of “Geometric information (G)-Historical samples (H)-Object attribute (O)-Snapshot collection (S)-Topology constraint (T)” (GHOST) is proposed, and methods for developing virtual digital-twin scenes architecture are presented. Based on the proposed modeling concept of GHOST for digital-twin, prototypes have been developed for the general platform of digital-twin RESTful services and the cross-platform general visual mock-up software. Experimental results show that this method is effective in the FMS lifecycle in various aspects.","Digital Mock-up (DMU), Digital-twin modeling, Flexible Manufacturing System, Virtual

In this paper we present a novel, modular digital twinning framework developed for the investigation of safety within collaborative robotic manufacturing processes. The modular architecture supports scalable representations of user-defined cyber-physical environments, and tools for safety analysis and control. This versatile research tool facilitates the creation of mixed environments of Digital Models, Digital Shadows, and Digital Twins, whilst standardising communication and physical system representation across different hardware platforms. The framework is demonstrated as applied to an industrial case-study focused on the safety assurance of a collaborative robotic manufacturing process. We describe the creation of a digital twin scenario, consisting of individual digital twins of entities in the manufacturing case study, and the application of a synthesised safety controller from our wider work. We show how the framework is able to provide adequate evidence to virtually assess safety claims made against the safety controller using a supporting validation module and testing strategy. The implementation, evidence and safety investigation is presented and discussed, raising exciting possibilities for the use of digital twins in robotic safety assurance.","automated code generation, collaborative robot safety, digital twins, human-robot collaboration, modular framework, probabilistic model checking, risk-informed software synthesis, robotics",,,,,,,,"<A Classification Proposal of Digital Twin Applications in the Safety Domain, {eid: 85100026730, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2021.107137}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems.","Architecture, Design methodology, Digital twin, Manufacturing, Production scheduling, Retrofitting, Virtual commissioning",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 33748892976}>, <A survey on digital twin: definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The facets of digital twins in production and the automotive industry.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability, interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability, and the CDT model’s integration in practice besides decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.","Artificial intelligence, Building lifecycle management, Cognitive, Decision support, Digital twins, IoT, Optimization, Self-learning",,,,,,,,"<A Concept for

The lack of interoperability between the data sources due to the usage of different APIs, data formats and data models results in time-consuming and error-prone manual data exchange efforts. The notion of digital twins is known to be a solution to the data silo problem and the associated interoperability issues. Despite many studies on digital twins, there is still a need for common architectures that offer means for defining digital twins, ingesting backend data in the digital twins, and enabling interoperable data exchange across the lifecycle of the devices via their digital twins. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a cloud-based architecture, a common information meta-model for defining the digital twins, and variety of APIs to query the lifecycle data of interest via the digital twins.","Cloud-based Architecture, Common Information Meta-model, Data-as-a-Product, Digital Twin, GraphQL",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85086457062}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85074335396}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <None, {eid: 85029833606}>, <File-and API-based interoperability of digital twins by model transformation: An iiot case study using asset administration shell, {eid: 85087587581}>, <None, {eid: 85122910738}>, <A four-layer architecture pattern for constructing and managing digital twins, {eid: 85072820852}>, <None, {eid: 85122955179}>, <Concept for managing multiple semantics with AutomationML-maturity level concept of semantic standardization, {eid: 84876369167}>, <None, {eid: 84990912817}>, <None, {eid: 85108734225}>, <None, {eid: 85040537203}>, <Migrating to GraphQL: A practical assessment, {eid: 85064162159}>, <An architecture of an intelligent digital twin in a cyber-physical production system, {eid: 85073869890}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <A digital twin based service oriented application for a 4. 0 knowledge navigation in the smart factory, {eid: 85052893769}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <Sensor data and information fusion to construct digital-twins virtual machine tools for cyber-physical manufacturing, {eid: 85023642484}>, <None, {eid: 85081637660}>, <Digital twin and big data towards smart manufacturing and industry 4. 0: 360 degree comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,9/7/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85122912045,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although there are a few research projects that have proposed available digital twin architectures, they are either missing critical components or difficult to be converted into a practical application. In this article, everything we proposed had been implemented in our production environment and is facilitating our manufacturing and mining processes. It is initiated by a data analytic maturity model which formulates the evaluation route of data analytics. Then, a novel six-layer digital twin model is established that aims to set the standards. In this model, we defined that all the automated calculation jobs should be driven by digital twin metadata such as the hyperparameters of machine learning. The metadata will be updated by metadata updating feedback flow which most current digital twin projects are missing.","computational intelligence, decision making support, digital twin, hybrid system, IoT",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin—the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <None, {eid: 85096783293}>, <Building blocks for a digital twin of additive manufacturing, {eid: 85021415524}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85060567049}>, <Profile: people first: mining across the globe, {eid: 85096806606}>, <None, {eid: 85096758701}>, <Cyber-physical-system-based safety monitoring for blind hoisting with the internet of things: a case study, {eid: 85056508559}>, <Robot online learning through digital twin experiments: a weightlifting project, {eid: 85050462497}>, <Digital twin of a cutting tool, {eid: 85049590588}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <None, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <C2PS: a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <None, {eid: 85019210345}>, <None, {eid: 84883264517}>, <Big data, fast data and data lake concepts, {eid: 85006413324}>, <Application of universal thermal climate index (UTCI) for assessment of occupational heat stress in open-pit mines, {eid: 85030982070}>, <Big data: a survey, {eid: 84898796363}>, <None, {eid: 74049113467}>, <MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters, {eid: 37549003336}>, <None, {eid: 84860493757}>, <Apache spark: a unified engine for big data processing, {eid: 84994589486}>, <None, {eid: 80052846318}>, <Remote real-time CNC machining for web-based manufacturing, {eid: 4944230156}>, <Multi-level predictive maintenance for multi-component systems, {eid: 84939620897}>, <None, {eid: 84988941708}>, <None, {eid: 85019700529}>, <None, {eid: 85033713492}>, <None, {eid: 84963869355}>, <A global manufacturing big data ecosystem for fault detection in predictive maintenance, {eid: 85078293835}>, <None, {eid: 85070934184}>, <Noise removal in the presence of significant anomalies for industrial IoT sensor data in manufacturing, {eid: 85089953058}>, <Missing value imputation for industrial IoT sensor data with large gaps, {eid: 85089934716}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,10/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85096747182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail. Furthermore, the digital model’s calibration is described jointly with the careful validation process carried out. Thanks to the latter, several conclusions and guidelines for future implementations were possible to derive as well.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Distributed control systems, Industrial agents, Multi-Agent System, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Smart factory performance and Industry 4.0, {eid: 85074301976}>, <International Journal of Production Economics Barriers to the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies in the manufacturing sector: An inter-country comparative perspective, {eid: 85075356283}>, <Fourth Industrial Revolution: Technological drivers, impacts and coping methods, {eid: 85024106943}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Resource virtualization: A core technology for developing cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85046643014}>, <A survey: Cyber-physical-social systems and their system-level design methodology, {eid: 85007507411}>, <Cyber-physical systems and their security issues, {eid: 85047107016}>, <Cyber-physical production systems: Roots, expectations and R&D challenges, {eid: 84904510850}>, <Design, modelling, simulation and integration of cyber physical systems: Methods and applications, {eid: 84992337524}>, <BIOSOARM: A bio-inspired self-organising architecture for manufacturing cyber-physical shopfloors, {eid: 85053644977}>, <Collaborative routing of products using a self-organizing mechatronic agent framework—A simulation study, {eid: 84923562719}>, <None, {eid: 84944405978}>, <Agent-based distributed manufacturing control: A state-of-the-art survey, {eid: 70149094122}>, <None, {eid: 85014884194}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Key Performance Indicators in Cyber-Physical Production Systems, {eid: 85049585878}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <A reconfigurable modeling approach for digital twin-based manufacturing system, {eid: 85070557472}>, <Automated Generation of as-manufactured geometric Representations for Digital Twins using STEP, {eid: 85076762262}>, <Review of digital twin applications in manufacturing, {eid: 85073116667}>, <Simulation-based Analysis of the Interaction of a Physical and a Digital Twin in a Cyber-Physical Production System, {eid: 85078895573}>, <Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Agent-based plug and produce cyber-physical production system—Test case, {eid: 85079032414}>, <Cycle time reduction in assembly and test manufacturing factories: A KPI driven methodology, {eid: 62749100645}>, <A framework for reducing manufacturing throughput time, {eid: 4944259808}>",,,MDPI AG,,,3/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85102529812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), aims at reducing the effort needed for changes in industrial production lines. The key benefits of next-generation manufacturing systems are less downtimes and the production of small lot sizes down to lot size 1. I4.0 does not introduce a silver bullet technology, but requires a transformation of the system architecture of production systems. In the literature, however, there systematic guidance for designing manufacturing systems that address central I4.0 use cases like plug'n'produce and end-to-end communication is still missing, as are details on the infrastructure needed to enable I4.0 technologies such as Digital Twins.

Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method “MagicGrid,” and the “V model” of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the “V model,” including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of “man, machine, material, and method” and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness.","Cyber-physical production system, Digital twin, MagicGrid,

We employ contemporary information technologies empowered by model-based systems engineering and advanced algebraic techniques to make the digital twin cost-effective to compose and operate while maintaining sufficient completeness, accuracy, and usability for practical purposes. The model-based digital twin architecture is proposed, which consists of an ontology, digital diagrams and visuals, electronic documentation, master data, real-Time data, and mathematical models. The energy domain ontology provides the unified semantic basis for interaction between all the models. The mathematical framework of category theory applies for rigorous formal description and verification of complex digital twin composition procedures.","category theory, digital twin, model-based systems engineering, ontology, power system",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770}>, <Composition and application of power system digital twins based on ontological modeling, {eid: 85079066546}>, <Generative design by using exploration approaches of reinforcement learning in density-based structural topology optimization, {eid: 85094938246}>, <Digital twin for operation of microgrid: Optimal scheduling in virtual space of digital twin, {eid: 85093964366}>, <None, {eid: 85098687083}>, <None, {eid: 85134639374}>, <Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers, {eid: 85050252398}>, <Systems analysis of life cycle of large-scale information-control systems, {eid: 84884873483}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Generic digital twin architecture for industrial energy systems, {eid: 85099477890}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <None, {eid: 84922790975}>, <Development of technology for creating digital twins of power transformers based on chain and 2D magnetic field models, {eid: 85098988240}>, <Predicting solar energy generation through artificial neural networks using weather forecasts for microgrid control, {eid: 85045085063}>, <SARGON-Smart energy domain ontology, {eid: 85103589220}>, <Domain engineering of distributed measurement systems, {eid: 79952967623}>, <An approach to develop a generative design technology for power systems, {eid: 85123726963}>, <Category theory as a formal mathematical foundation for model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85010868069}>, <Categories in control, {eid: 84934758088}>, <Methods of category theory in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85041589218}>, <Methods of the category theory in digital design of heterogeneous cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85104126753}>, <Ologs: A categorical framework for knowledge representation, {eid: 84856458778}>, <Categorical approach to modelling and to coupling of models, {eid: 85007569930}>, <Compositional models for power systems, {eid: 85092619490}>, <Modeling concurrency with partial orders, {eid: 34250124963}>, <Software mediators as firstclass entities of systems-of-systems software architectures, {eid: 85070969935}>, <Category theory as a mathematical pragmatics of model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85047069149}>, <Leveraging category theory in model based enterprise, {eid: 85083873739}>, <Experience implementing a performant category-theory library in Coq, {eid: 84904798075}>, <A platform-based approach to implementation of future smart distributed energy control systems, {eid: 85098996431}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123741651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS. This study thus contributes toward the advancement of intelligent machine tools from the context of smart manufacturing.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Machine tool, Monitoring, Sensor

However, the dilemma between the scope and scale needs a sophisticated reference architecture, a right set of technologies, and a suitable business model. Most studies in the Digital Twin field have only focused on manufacturing and proposed explicit frameworks and architecture, which faced challenges to support different integration levels through an agile process. Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service and mass individualization.","Augmented reality, Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Industry

How to systematically monitor and evaluate its overall real-time operation status, and to invoke the most appropriate decision-making level, use the most economical computational resource, and conduct a synchronized decision-making and control to the most accurate operation scope to address a randomly occurred dynamics has remained a long-term challenge for researchers. This paper proposes a multi-level cloud computing enabled digital twin system for the real-time monitor, decision and control of a synchronized production logistics system. In the IoT-driven production logistics synchronization (PLS) system with complete real-time information, the dynamics that occurred in the physical layer could be accurately and real-timely captured and its negative effects on the system's overall operation state could be effectively evaluated in the digital layer. For slight, moderate and severe dynamics, edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing and their dynamically formed multi-level distributed decision-making system will be used to deal with the dynamics in the most effective and economical mode. Finally, the PLS optimization model of production and storage is presented with an industrial case, and the effectiveness is also demonstrated and analyzed.","Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Edge computing, Fog computing, Production logistics, Synchronization",,,,,,,,"<Internet-of-things based dynamic synchronization of production and logistics: Mechanism, System and Case Study, {eid: 84949956483}>, <Synchronized Decision-making and Control Method for Opti-state Execution of Dynamic Production Systems with Internet of Things, {eid: 85056344896, doi: 10.3901/JME.2018.16.024}>, <Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics synchronization mechanism and method toward customer order dynamics, {eid: 85018782598, doi: 10.1177/0142331217691218}>, <CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud computing and internet of things-based cloud manufacturing service system, {eid: 84896931467, doi: 10.1109/TII.2014.2306383}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143, doi: 10.1115/MSEC2018-6435}>, <Cavitation phenomena in the injection nozzle: theoretical and numerical analysis, {eid: 80054776618}>, <Flexible machine layout design for dynamic and uncertain production environments, {eid: 0032122942}>, <Towards IoT-enabled dynamic service optimal selection in multiple manufacturing clouds, {eid: 85086824960, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.004}>, <A fault-tolerant control strategy for multiple automated guided vehicles, {eid: 85080141919, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.02.009}>, <New integration of preventive maintenance and production planning with cell formation and group scheduling for dynamic cellular manufacturing systems, {eid: 85087394458, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.011}>, <A multi-objective algorithm for task scheduling and resource allocation in cloud-based disassembly, {eid: 84991271089, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.09.008}>, <Coordinating order acceptance and integrated production-distribution scheduling with batch delivery considering Third Party Logistics distribution, {eid: 85034077664, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.11.001}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152, doi: 10.13196/j.cims.2017.08.001}>, <Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication, 2014, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Isogeometric Fatigue Damage Prediction in Large-Scale Composite Structures Driven by Dynamic Sensor Data, {eid: 84953888837, doi: 10.1115/1.4030795}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958, doi: 10.1115/SMASIS2015-8975}>, <A travel-time model for a person-onboard order picking system, {eid: 69249215373}>, <RFID-based wireless manufacturing for real-time management of job shop WIP inventories, {eid: 51849166450, doi: 10.1007/s00170-006-0897-4}>, <Cloud manufacturing: A computing and service-oriented manufacturing model, {eid: 84862908560, doi: 10.1177/0954405411405575}>, <Digital Twin Data Modeling with AutomationML and a Communication Methodology for Data Exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <Digital-twin-driven geometric optimization of centrifugal impeller with free- form blades for fi ve-axis fl ank milling, {eid: 85087755544, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.019}>, <MES-integrated digital twin frameworks, {eid: 85085180521, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.05.007}>, <Digital Twin as Enabler for an Innovative Digital Shopfloor Management System in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen -

Specifically, we decompose the petrochemical process into five levels one by one and build a digital twin plug-in for each component of the component layers, and then inversely decouple the process to assemble the DTs layer by layer. As a specific experimental example, the characteristic DTs is proposed to build modules of temperature field and pressure field and flow field, these DT modules are driven by practical industrial sampling data from cracking furnace, and three characteristic DTS modules stated above are integrated to form DTS.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)Complex manufacturing and supply chain systems consist of concurrent labour-intensive processes and procedures with repetitive time-consuming tasks and multiple quality checks. These features may pose challenges for the efficient operation and management, while manual tasks may significantly increase human errors or near misses, having impact on the propagation of effects and parallel interactions within these systems. In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, a digital twin (DT) integrated in a multi-agent cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) with the help of RFID technology is proposed. The proposed reference architecture tends to improve the trackability and traceability of complex manufacturing processes. In this research work, the interactions occurring both within a single complex manufacturing system and between multiple sites within a supply chain are considered. For the implementation of the integrated DT-CPMS, a simulation model employing the agent-based modelling technique is developed. A case study from a cryogenic supply chain in the UK is also selected to show the application and validity of the proposed digital solution. The results prove that the DT-CPMS architecture can improve system's performance in terms of human, equipment and space utilisations.","Agent-based modelling, Complex manufacturing, Cyber-Physical System, Digital twin, RFID",,,,,,,,"<C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical System for sustainable project Scheduling, {eid: 85079645451}>, <Defining a digital twin-based Cyber-physical production System for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85086260271}>, <A modular hybrid simulation framework for complex manufacturing system design, {eid: 85061135493}>, <RFID application in a multi-agent cyber physical manufacturing system, {eid: 85106918005}>, <A review on human-centered IoT-connected smart labels for the industry 4.0, {eid: 85046488692}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <Blockchain-based data management for digital twin of product, {eid: 85079151075}>, <Reference framework for digital twins within cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <The multi-agent approach for developing a cyber-physical system for managing precise farms with digital twins of plants, {eid: 85077607130}>, <A Cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <FMU-supported simulation for CPS digital twin, {eid: 85070631431}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical production system architectural framework for personalized production, {eid: 85076628276}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Digital twins and cyber-physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Development of a smart cyber-physical manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context, {eid: 85070961256}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart, {eid: 85120705540}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,6/7/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85120686175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: ‘What is a Digital Twin?’; ‘Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?’; ‘When has a Digital Twin to be developed?’; ‘Why should a Digital Twin be used?’; ‘How to design and implement a Digital Twin?’; ‘What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?’. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Predictive manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Reconfiguration of smart products during their use phase based on virtual product twins, {eid: 85018758116}>, <Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, {eid: 0027621699}>, <C2PS: a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Scanning the industry 4.0: a literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114}>, <Systems engineering and digital twin: a vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations, {eid: 85105583310}>, <Digital twin in the Analysis of a Big Data, {eid: 85072950216}>, <The internet of things: a survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <Platform for industrial internet and digital twin focused education, research, and innovation: Ilmatar the overhead crane, {eid: 85050503484, doi: 10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355217}>, <Digital Twin: applying emulation for machine reconditioning, {eid: 85049565560, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.139}>, <Model-based design of complex aeronautical systems through digital twin and thread concepts, {eid: 85086259314}>, <Generating Digital Twin Models Using Knowledge Graphs for Industrial Production Lines, {eid: 85050702266}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1526324}>, <Exploiting the digital twin in the assessment and optimization of sustainability performances’, {eid: 85065990183}>, <A survey on digital twin: definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <An OPC-UA based approach for dynamic-configuration of security credentials and integrating a vendor independent digital product memory, {eid: 84946766401}>, <Data flow and communication framework supporting digital twin for geometry assurance, {eid: 85040912304, doi: 10.1115/IMECE2017-71405}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834}>, <Digital transformation of manufacturing through cloud services and resource virtualization, {eid: 85062964121, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin—the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Next generation digital twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen -

Based on the digital twin technology, a quad-play CMCO (i.e., Configuration design-Motion planning-Control development-Optimization decoupling) design architecture is put forward for the design of the flow-type smart manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context. The iteration logic of the CMCO design model is expounded. Two key enabling technologies for enabling the customized and software-defined design of flow-type smart manufacturing systems are presented, including the generalized encapsulation of the quad-play CMCO model and the digital twin technique. A prototype of a digital twin-based manufacturing system design platform, named Digital Twin System, is presented based on the CMCO model. The digital twin-based design platform is verified with a case study of the hollow glass smart manufacturing system. The result shows that the Digital Twin System-based design approach is feasible and efficient.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Manufacturing system design, Smart

The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme's performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.","Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, CNC, Digital Twin, Ensemble Learning, Industry 4.0, Smart Contract",,,,,,,,"<The industrial internet of things (iiot): An analysis framework, {eid: 85047947260}>, <Blockchain for industry 4.0: A comprehensive review, {eid: 85084927004}>, <Industrial internet of things: Recent advances, enabling technologies and open challenges, {eid: 85076038840}>, <Empirical vulnerability analysis of automated smart contracts security testing on blockchains, {eid: 85059352378}>, <None, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence for secure drone networking underlying 5g communications, {eid: 85115711383}>, <None, {eid: 85115694313}>, <Blohost: Blockchain enabled smart tourism and hospitality management, {eid: 85074157801}>, <Digital twin modeling method for cnc machine tool, {eid: 85048211080}>, <Representing industrial data streams in digital twins using semantic labeling, {eid: 85062594541}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Virtualisation process of a sheet metal punching machine within the industry 4.0 vision, {eid: 85018352966}>, <Digital twin workshop: A new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <None, {eid: 85118082450}>, <None, {eid: 85070603892}>, <None, {eid: 85088137878}>, <An ensemble of multiple boosting methods based on classifier-specific soft voting for intelligent vehicle crash injury severity prediction, {eid: 85092293426}>, <Blockchain-envisioned softwarized multi-swarming uavs to tackle covid-19 situations, {eid: 85103433332}>, <6g-enabled edge intelligence for ultra -reliable low latency applications: Vision and mission, {eid: 85100794744}>, <None, {eid: 85115703940}>, <None, {eid: 85069208720}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/14/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85115682919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the use of a digital twin architecture, we develop a decision support system to schedule preventive maintenance interventions with the aim of minimizing production throughout penalties via the exploitation of real-time opportunities such as supply shortages, momentary machine idleness or machine breakdowns.

A Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) exploits these infrastructures to provide an accurate digital representation of the organization. Beyond the usual representation of devices, machines and physical assets supplied by Digital Twins, a DTO also include processes, services, people, roles, and all other relevant elements for the operation of organizations. Therefore, DTO can play a key role in realizing and analyzing aspects of organizations, assisting managers on the knowledge of the organization status, and foreseeing possible effects of potential changes in the organization. However, due to the dynamic, open, and ever-changing environment of organizations, an established DTO will soon degrade or even lose all its utility. Therefore, a DTO needs to evolve to recover its utility when the organization changes. The development of flexible, resilient, and easy to evolve DTO has not been well-addressed yet. Most of the existing proposals are context-dependent, system-specific, or focus on providing solutions in high-level abstraction. This work leverages Enterprise Architecture to propose an architectural pattern to serve as a blueprint toward the development of resilient DTO.","Architectural pattern, Enterprise architecture, Resilient Digital Twin of Organization",,,,,,,,"<C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Aligning architectures for sustainability, {eid: 85026413862}>, <None, {eid: 85035094359}>, <A conceptual framework for resilience: fundamental definitions, strategies and metrics, {eid: 85097568269}>, <None, {eid: 85019203785}>, <Reference framework for digital twins within cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <From dependability to resilience, {eid: 70350027029}>, <Digital twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <None, {eid: 85115053842}>, <None, {eid: 85115446489}>, <Synchronizing physical and digital factory: Benefits and technical challenges, {eid: 85065426578}>, <A six-layer architecture for the digital twin: A manufacturing case study implementation, {eid: 85076271545}>, <None, {eid: 84979049527}>, <None, {eid: 85115443730}>, <On the implementation of IoT-based digital twin for networked microgrids resiliency against cyber attacks, {eid: 85094810910}>, <Adaptivity and self-organization in organic computing systems, {eid: 77957659542}>, <Enterprise architecture modeling with the unified modeling language, {eid: 84876017472}>, <An architecture of an intelligent digital twin in a cyber-physical production system, {eid: 85073869890}>, <Five-dimension digital twin modeling and its key technologies, {eid: 85064427099}>, <None, {eid: 85115442503}>, <Four concepts for resilience and the implications for the future of resilience engineering, {eid: 84937906751}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/13/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85115446405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination with advanced data analytics and information and communication technologies allows Digital Twins to perform real-time simulation, optimization and prediction to their physical counterparts. Efficient bi-directional data exchange is the foundation for Digital Twin implementation. However, the widely mentioned cloud-based architecture has disadvantages, such as high pressure on bandwidth and long latency time, which limit Digital Twins to provide real-time operating responses in dynamic manufacturing processes. Edge computing has the characteristics of low connectivity, the capability of immediate analysis and access to temporal data for real-time analytics, which makes it a fit-for-purpose technology for Digital Twin development. In this paper, the benefits of edge computing to Digital Twin are first explained through the reviews of the two technologies. The Digital Twin functions to be performed at the edge are then elaborated. After that, how the data model will be used in the edge for data mapping to realize the Digital Twin is illustrated and the data mapping strategy based on the EXPRESS schemas is discussed. Finally, a case study is carried out to verify the data mapping strategy based on EXPRESS schema.

However, there are major challenges to efficiently build and update the DT-based simulation system and provide simulation as a service (SimaaS): 1) virtualization machine based heavyweight methods to create simulation environments for DT models consume too much resource and time; 2) DT-based simulation systems in the cloud or developers’ desktops could not well support the real-time response and synchronize with the physical counterparts at the edge of the network. Therefore, a methodology of container virtualization based simulation as a service (CVSimaaS) is put forward to utilize lightweight containers to realize convenient DT system deployment and less resource consumption with high efficiency. Then a device-edge-cloud system architecture with a formal process are proposed to support the CVSimaaS paradigm. A matrix based management and scheduling model for computing infrastructure, container images and services is established to support the efficient CVSimaaS process. Finally, the methodology is applied to building a DT-based simulation system for intelligent manufacturing. The results show that the DT-based simulation system can be 1) easily deployed to heterogeneous infrastructure and terminals at the cloud, edge and device, and 2) parallelly scheduled and operated on high performance cloud/edge on demand for large-scale online analysis.","Cloud simulation, Container virtualization, Digital twin, Efficient parallel simulation, Simulation as a service, Smart industrial service system",,,,,,,,"<Overcoming the internet impasse through virtualization, {eid: 18144370444, doi: 10.1109/MC.2005.136}>, <Toward botnet mesocosms, {eid: 85093835044}>, <Xen and the art of virtualization, {eid: 21644433634}>, <Opportunities and risks of software-as-a-service: findings from a survey of IT executives, {eid: 80455174683, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2011.07.007}>, <A data-driven synchronization technique for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84979715976}>, <Containers and cloud: from lxc to docker to kubernetes, {eid: 84923248887}>, <Containers and cloud: from lxc to docker to kubernetes, {eid: 84923248887, doi: 10.1109/MCC.2014.51}>, <The H2020 OCRE project opens the gates of the commercial cloud and EO services usage to the research community, {eid: 85090726075, doi: 10.28991/esj-2020-01213}>, <Customer experience challenges: bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291, doi: 10.1108/JOSM-04-2018-0113}>, <Digital twin-the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Rethinking ooda: toward a modern cognitive framework of command decision making, {eid: 33846291429}>, <Rapid controller prototyping with matlab/simulink and linux, {eid: 27144445855, doi: 10.1016/j.conengprac.2004.09.009}>, <Joint modeling and analysis using XMSF Web services, {eid: 17744387164}>, <Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility, {eid: 63649117166, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2008.12.001}>, <Blockchains and smart contracts for the internet of things, {eid: 84979828304, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2566339}>, <Modeling cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155172767, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2011.2160929}>, <Digital Twin: digitize assets and processes to enable better industrial outcomes, {eid: 85092529554}>, <Integrating HLA and service-oriented architecture in a simulation framework, {eid: 84863644548}>, <Virtualization vs containerization to support PaaS, {eid: 84908583822}>, <Appendix G: FMI-functional mockup interface, {eid: 85092476539}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and US Air Force Vehicles. 53rd Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference: Special Session on the Digital Twin, {eid: 84881426231}>, <A cloud simulation based environment for multi-disciplinary collaborative simulation and optimization, {eid: 85034091101}>, <Pervasive computing integrated discrete event simulation for a hospital digital twin, {eid: 85061906345}>, <Performance comparison of image and workload management of edge computing using different virtualization technologies, {eid: 85027836283}>, <Parallel Discrete Event Simulation with AnyLogic.

While Industry 4.0 is still a big challenge for many manufacturing companies, reference architectures have been increasingly adopted in different domains to guide engineers on how their systems should interoperate and be structured. Companies have made different experiences with reference architectures for Industry 4.0. However, depending on the use cases addressed, a reference architecture may be more or less suited to support the transformation of a particular company. Besides, a complete understanding of existing representative architectures does not exist. The main goal of this work is to review existing reference architectures for Industry 4.0 and analyze them concerning their suitability for supporting Industry 4.0 processes and solutions. For this, we systematically researched these architectures and thoroughly analyzed and characterized them. We also address their use and technologies/tools that could support their implementation. As a result, we found that existing architectures still have a long way to go; hence, we present the most urgent steps for the near future. We conclude that the Industry 4.0 community is right in investing in reference architectures considering the future of Industry 4.0.","Industry 4.0, Interoperability, Reference architecture, Software

Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts.","digital twins, domain-knowledge, fault management, FMEA, knowledge-driven, state machines, transition system",,,,,,,,"<Modeling of discrete event systems using finite automata with variables, {eid: 62749203693}>, <Owl web ontology language overview, {eid: 1842550305}>, <Knowledge-based engineering of automation systems using ontologies and engineering data."" in, {eid: 84961126728}>, <Design and development of digital twins: A case study in supply chains, {eid: 85085970937}>, <Digital twin for rotating machinery fault diagnosis in smart manufacturing, {eid: 85058187499}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <A data-And knowledge-driven framework for digital twin manufacturing cell, {eid: 85070560451}>, <Next generation digital twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <Toward a unified english-like representation of semantic models, data, and graph patterns for subject matter experts, {eid: 84979072313}>, <None, {eid: 84891403588}>, <M&c ml: A modeling language for monitoring and control systems, {eid: 84969672798}>, <Semantics and complexity of sparql, {eid: 70349088138}>, <Introduction to scxml, {eid: 85009675124}>, <Building code generators for dsls using a partial evaluator for the xtend language, {eid: 84910655351}>, <Mdsheet: A framework for model-driven spreadsheet engineering, {eid: 84864232451}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,10/13/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85119495014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, however, AI is still used in a limited way in a production environment, often focusing on a single production step and using out-of-the-box AI algorithms. AI models that use information spanning a complete production line and even larger parts of the product lifecycle could add significant value for production companies. In this paper, we suggest a digital twin architecture to support the complete AI lifecycle (discovering correlations, learning, deploying and validating), based on a knowledge graph that centralizes all information. We show how this digital twin could ease information access to different heterogenous data sources and pose opportunities for a wider application of AI in production industry. We illustrate this approach using a simplified industrial example of a compressor housing production, leading to preliminary results that show how a data scientist can efficiently access, through the knowledge graph, all necessary data for the creation of an AI model.","AI in production, Data architecture, Digital twin, Knowledge graph",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85115242299}>, <None, {eid: 85115244584}>, <None, {eid: 85096425748}>, <None, {eid: 85115203153}>, <None, {eid: 85115222599}>, <None, {eid: 84868582947}>, <Ontology based knowledge representation technique, domain modeling languages and planners for robotic path planning: A survey, {eid: 85046619517}>, <Ontologies for Industry 4.0, {eid: 85082812338}>, <A rule-based approach founded on description logics for Industry 4.0 smart factories, {eid: 85079240619}>, <Context modeling for Industry 4.0: An ontology based approach, {eid: 85056660664}>, <None, {eid: 85115210339}>, <Enriching analytics models with domain knowledge for smart manufacturing data analysis, {eid: 85076467739}>, <Semantic integration of bosch manufacturing data using virtual knowledge graphs, {eid: 85096571668}>, <Ontology based data access in statoil, {eid: 85024124602}>, <Optique: Towards OBDA systems for industry, {eid: 84892667646}>, <Towards a semantic administrative shell for Industry 4.0 components, {eid: 84968909041}>, <None, {eid: 85115273245}>, <None, {eid: 85115241021}>, <None, {eid: 85115263734}>, <Matters of (Meta-)modeling, {eid: 34248658631}>, <Ontop: Answering SPARQL queries over relational databases, {eid: 85002527435}>, <Ultrawrap: SPARQL execution on relational data, {eid: 84885574207}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/5/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85115228399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MCX framework facilitates co-execution of, and asynchronous data communication between, physical systems and their digital simulation models. MCX supports running FMUs (simulation models packaged according to the FMI specification) as well as machine learning models and customized models. We propose extensions to the previously published ModelConductor framework for higher performance and better scalability. The extensions include decoupling of the queue and the model computation module, utilization of a standard data transmission protocol and implementation of the facility to run time-consuming simulation models in a time synchronous manner. Additionally, three new validation case studies are presented. A performance evaluation shows that the extensions improve the average response time almost 4 times in three specific experiments.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, On-line simulation",,,,,,,,"<Modelconductor: An on-line data management architecture for digital twins, {eid: 85093363897}>, <On the congruence of modularity and code coupling, {eid: 80053207577}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <Review of digital twin applications in manufacturing, {eid: 85073116667}>, <Industrial cyberphysical systems: A backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, {eid: 85017598124}>, <A review of wind turbine bearing condition monitoring: State of the art and challenges, {eid: 84949921085}>, <None, {eid: 85108188349}>, <None, {eid: 85048500946}>, <Data-driven digital twin technology for optimized control in process systems, {eid: 85065787181}>, <Comparative analysis of 5g mobile communication network architectures, {eid: 85083307483}>, <A state-of-the-art survey of digital twin: techniques, engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation perspectives, {eid: 85086999048}>, <None, {eid: 85108219368}>, <Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python, {eid: 80555140075}>",,,European Council for Modelling and Simulation,,,5/31/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85108199213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contribution of this paper is to provide an analysis about digital twin (meaning and modeling), and to present a platform that works as: (1) a modern distributed system that runs as a cluster and can elastically scale to handle and integrate all the business applications, systems, and production data even the most massive data volumes; (2) a storage system that keeps data as long as necessary and provides real guarantees in delivery, persistence, performance (real time), reliability, and processing; (3) a real-time event-based platform that supports the requirements of digital twin applications including the management and support of different digital twin versions.","Digital twin, Event-based architecture, Real-time information, Smart production systems",,,,,,,,"<TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, {eid: 85112631124}>, <An industrial Internet of things based platform for context-aware information services in manufacturing, {eid: 85050917823, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2018.1500716}>, <None, {eid: 85112593671}>, <Apache Kafka.

These CPPSs are long-living complex systems deployed to and configured for diverse environments. Due to specific deployment, configuration, wear and tear, or other environmental effects, their behavior might diverge from the intended behavior over time. Properly adapting the configuration of CPPSs then relies on the expertise of human operators. Digital Twins (DTs) that reify this expertise and learn from it to address unforeseen challenges can significantly facilitate self-adaptive manufacturing where experience is very specific and, hence, insufficient to employ deep learning techniques. We leverage the explicit modeling of domain expertise through case-based reasoning to improve the capabilities of Digital Twins for adapting to such situations. To this effect, we present a modeling framework for self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin. Automatically configuring Digital Twins based on explicitly modeled domain expertise can improve manufacturing times, reduce wastage, and, ultimately, contribute to better sustainable manufacturing.","Case-Based Reasoning, Digital Twins, Domain-Specific Languages, Self-Adaptive Manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Modeling languages in industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches, {eid: 0028401306}>, <None, {eid: 0003602871}>, <Model-driven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <Model-driven digital twin construction: Synthesizing the integration of cyber-physical systems with their information systems, {eid: 85096992990}>, <Towards a model-driven architecture for interactive digital twin cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <PDDL2. 1: An extension to PDDL for expressing temporal planning domains, {eid: 27444434099}>, <The metric-ff planning system: Translating""ignoring delete lists""to numeric state variables, {eid: 13444301819}>, <The FF planning system: Fast plan generation through heuristic search, {eid: 0012303825}>, <None, {eid: 85071368063}>, <Software language engineering in the large: Towards composing and deriving languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <The state of the art in language workbenches, {eid: 84891295467}>, <Engineering tagging languages for dsls, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Systematic language extension mechanisms for the montiarc architecture description language, {eid: 85025126026}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Opc ua-service-oriented architecture for industrial applications, {eid: 77956601130}>, <Towards a model-driven architecture for interactive digital twin cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <None, {eid: 85032933256}>, <A digital twin architecture based on the industrial internet of things technologies, {eid: 85063782240}>, <None, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <Improving efficiency of self-configurable autonomic systems using clustered cbr approach, {eid: 78049524636}>, <Achieving self-healing in service delivery software systems by means of case-based reasoning, {eid: 38149078184}>, <Rationalism with a dose of empiricism: Case-based reasoning for requirements-driven self-adaptation, {eid: 84909956065}>, <Rationalism with a dose of empiricism: Combining goal reasoning and case-based reasoning for self-adaptive software systems, {eid: 84943362770}>, <A reinforcement learning-based framework for the generation and evolution of adaptation rules, {eid: 85034442783}>, <Application of case based reasoning injection moulding, {eid: 0030865479}>, <An intelligent system for plastic injection molding process design, {eid: 0030787208}>, <Intelligent methods for the process parameter determination of plastic injection molding, {eid: 85038372482}>, <An integrated intelligent system for injection molding process determination, {eid: 41549113449}>, <Digital Twin concept for smart injection molding, {eid: 85046263291}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/18/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85113473628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital Twins (DT) in industrial cyber-physical systems are the key enabling technology for Industry 4.0. Services are an essential part of almost every DT concept, but their interaction is usually implementation-specific since no common guidelines are available. This work identifies some fundamental requirements for a DT service framework based on applications identified in corresponding literature. Based on these requirements, a service framework architecture is proposed. The architecture utilizes Semantic Web technology and a workflow engine for service orchestration to support the fulfilment of the identified requirements. As a case study for sensor data evaluation of an industrial process, a proof-of-concept implementation is presented, showing the feasibility and suitability of the proposed DT service framework architecture.","Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Knowlege graph, Microservice, Semantic Web, Service architecture, Workflow engine",,,,,,,,"<Reviewing literature on digitalization, business model

Through digital twin technology, it is virtually possible to virtualize a product, process or service and the information interaction and co-evolution between physical and information world. Machine Learning (ML) can improve the cognitive, reasoning and decision-making abilities of the digital twin through knowledge extraction. The full life cycle management of complex equipment is considered the key to the intelligent transformation and upgrading of the modern manufacturing industry. The application of the above two technologies in the full life cycle management of complex equipment is going to make each stage of the life cycle more responsive, predictable and adaptable. In this study, we have proposed a full life cycle digital twin architecture for complex equipment. We have described four specific scenarios in which two typical machine learning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning are applied which are further used to enhance digital twin in various stages of complex equipment.

The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.","artificial intelligence, big data, Digital twin, industry 40, machine

Today's proprietary technical systems lead to strictly defined engineering processes and value chains. Interacting Digital Twins (DT) are considered an enabling technology that could help to increase flexibility based on semantically enriched information. Nevertheless, for interacting digital twins to become a reality, their implementation should be based on existing standards like the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). Additionally, DT Platforms could accelerate development, deployment and ensure resilient operation of DT. This paper presents such a platform based on a microservices architecture and offering solutions for continuous deployment, data infrastructure and I4.0 business services. The platform is evaluated in the use case scenarios platform-based manufacturing and collaborative condition monitoring. As a result, implemented AAS-based mi-croservices organize manufacturing, and submodels of the AAS enable cross-company data sharing for collaborative condition monitoring. Future work should focus on fault-management and service recovery, as well as integration of the AAS into lower platform layers, e.g. for improving data usage control.","Asset Administration Shell, Big Data Platform, Collaborative Condition Monitoring, Digital Twin, GAIA-X, Industrie 4.0, Manufacturing, Mi-croservices Architecture, Semantic Interoperability",,,,,,,,"<Challenges for the cyber-physical manufacturing enterprises of the future, {eid: 85061639439}>, <Scalable analytics platform for machine learning in smart production systems, {eid: 85074210292}>, <None, {eid: 85112348367}>, <None, {eid: 85112352078}>, <None, {eid: 85090931985}>, <None, {eid: 84941570640}>, <The digital twin theory-eine neue sicht auf ein modewort, {eid: 85093359582}>, <Towards industrie 4. 0 compliant configuration of condition monitoring services, {eid: 85041241423}>, <Pursuing the vision of industrie 4. 0: Secure plug-and-produce by means of the asset administration shell and blockchain technology, {eid: 85055499013}>, <Cloud-based plug and work architecture of the iic testbed smart factory web, {eid: 85057215799}>, <Plug-and-produce für fertigungssysteme, {eid: 84929957486}>, <Towards data sovereignty of asset administration shells across value added chains, {eid: 85093356879}>, <None, {eid: 85045044466}>, <None, {eid: 85112352335}>, <None, {eid: 84908886940}>, <None, {eid: 85041184245}>, <None, {eid: 85112371031}>, <None, {eid: 85112375634}>, <None, {eid: 85112381732}>, <None, {eid: 85078704937}>, <None, {eid: 85112389439}>, <None, {eid: 85112377060}>, <None, {eid: 85112357082}>, <None, {eid: 84964234114}>, <None, {eid: 85046797891}>, <None, {eid: 85112380088}>, <None, {eid: 85112375277}>, <None, {eid: 85112395543}>, <Architecture for knowledge exploration of industrial data for integration into digital services, {eid: 85093361362}>, <An approach for data pipeline with distributed query engine for industrial applications, {eid: 85093357935}>, <None, {eid: 85112353341}>, <Continuous delivery: Huge benefits, but challenges too, {eid: 84925140948}>, <None, {eid: 85112370293}>, <None, {eid: 85112383448}>, <None, {eid: 85112393795}>, <None, {eid: 85112362285}>, <None, {eid: 85112381314}>, <None, {eid: 85112363002}>, <Cloud manufacturing: A new manufacturing paradigm, {eid: 84892430418}>, <Cloud manufacturing: A computing and service-oriented manufacturing model, {eid: 84862908560}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85112348850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Digital Twin Web follows a similar structure to the World Wide Web and consists of meta-level digital twins that are described as digital twin description documents and distributed via Digital Twin Web servers. Standards must be established before the Digital Twin Web can be used efficiently, and having an easily accessible server implementation can foster the development of those standards. Twinbase is an open-source, Git-based Digital Twin Web server developed with user-friendliness in mind. Twinbase stores digital twin documents in a Git repository, modifies them with Git workflows, and distributes them to users via a static web server, from which the documents can be accessed via a client library or a regular web browser. A demo server is available at https://dtw.twinbase.org and new server instances can be initialized free-of-charge at GitHub via its browser interface. Twinbase is built with GitHub repository, Pages, and Actions but can be extended to support other providers or self-hosting. We describe the underlying architecture of Twinbase to support the creation of derivative and alternative server implementations. The Digital Twin Web requires permanent, globally accessible, and transferable identifiers to function properly, and to address this issue, we introduce the concept of digital twin identifier registry. Performance measurements showed that the median response times for fetching a digital twin document from Twinbase varied between 0.4 and 1.2 seconds depending on the identifier registry.","Cyber-physical systems, cyberspace, digital twin web, digital twins, Internet of Things, internet topology, metadata, metamodeling, open-source software, semantic web, web

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)In recent years, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced in many areas and landed the approach in top strategic technology trends. However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering.","Anylogic, Digital twin, Framework, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference Model for the Cloud-based Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Virtual doppelgangers: Psychological effects of avatars who ignore their owners, {eid: 78650651283}>, <The digital shadow of production - A concept for the effective and efficient information supply in dynamic industrial environments, {eid: 85049581408}>, <Towards a reasoning framework for digital clones using the digital thread, {eid: 85017212799}>, <Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291}>, <Digital twin - The simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided Vehicle in M2M logic.

However, their inherent complexity makes them difficult to develop and prove correct. In this paper we explore the use of UML and OCL, complemented with an executable language, SOIL, to build and test digital twins at a high level of abstraction. We also show how to realize the bidirectional connection between the UML models of the digital twin in the USE tool with the physical twin, using an architectural framework centered on a data lake. We have built a prototype of the framework to demonstrate our ideas, and validated it by developing a digital twin of a Lego Mindstorms car.

Web-based digital twin (WDT) has great potential for promoting sustainability in industrial cyber-physical systems. The current work demonstrates the mechanism by which a WDT architecture is established and utilised for improving sustainability. This is achieved by: a) accessing the control parameters that influence energy consumption, b) logging the energy consumption data and c) producing predictions by means of a computational algorithm. The objective is to support the system developer in delivering verified machine functionality along with trusted productivity and sustainability. The implementation is exemplified by an industrial case study adopted from a battery assembly production line.","Online technologies, Sustainability, Sustainable manufacturing, Web-based digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Virtual engineering in the support of sustainable assembly systems, {eid: 85100852318}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85112384663}>, <A prototype web-based user interface for sustainability modeling and optimization, {eid: 85112367657}>, <Sustainable manufacturing indicator repository, {eid: 84863583988}>, <Factory optima: A web-based system for composition and analysis of manufacturing service networks based on a reusable model repository, {eid: 85061330013}>, <Energy-efficient cyber-physical production network: Architecture and technologies, {eid: 85060116834}>, <Embedded digital twin for arti-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <Resource virtualization: A core technology for developing cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85046643014}>, <Towards industry 4. 0 with iot: Optimizing business processes in an evolving manufacturing factory, {eid: 85072729743}>, <Exploiting the digital twin in the assessment and optimization of sustainability performances, {eid: 85065990183}>, <Digital twin-based sustainable intelligent manufacturing: A review, {eid: 85072166366}>, <A digital twin for grinding wheel: An information sharing platform for sustainable grinding process, {eid: 85059482106}>, <Energy-aware resources in digital twin: The case of injection moulding machines, {eid: 85070656949}>, <Service-oriented platform for smart operation of dyeing and finishing industry, {eid: 85060933276}>, <Digital twin for energy optimization in an SMT-PCB assembly line, {eid: 85061704099}>, <Event-driven online machine state decision for energy-efficient manufacturing system based on digital twin using max-plus algebra, {eid: 85072638218}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Maintenance and digital health control in smart manufacturing based on condition monitoring, {eid: 85100866106}>, <None, {eid: 84984837118}>, <None, {eid: 0003754441}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85112350537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This article contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter, referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason, to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities as well as benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields.","Cyber-physical systems, digital twins (DTs), robotics",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85101762292}>, <None, {eid: 85101768198}>, <Digital twins of human robot collaboration in a production setting, {eid: 85060466179}>, <Integrated architecture for industrial robot programming and control, {eid: 0033309389}>, <Parallel simulation of virtual testbed applications, {eid: 85101763686}>, <Industry 4.0-digital twins and opc ua, {eid: 85101773235}>, <Digital twin driven human-robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252}>, <Digital twin and virtual reality: A co-simulation environment for design and assessment of industrial workstations, {eid: 85071966393}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control overmobile networks:Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Integrating virtual reality and digital twin in circular economy practices: A laboratory application case, {eid: 85082818983}>, <Digital manufacturing tools in the simulation of collaborative robots: Towards industry 4.0, {eid: 85085079406}>, <Human robot interaction for future remote manipulations in industry 4.0, {eid: 85101740360}>, <Motion planning by integration of multiple policies for complex assembly tasks, {eid: 85101767758}>, <Design and constant force control of a parallel polishing machine, {eid: 84910683748}>, <Force control of cable-driven parallel robots, {eid: 84988532625}>, <On the role of robot configuration in cartesian stiffness control, {eid: 84938271186}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Methoden der mehrkörperdynamiksimulation als grundlage realitätsnaher virtueller welten, {eid: 84892853013}>, <Velocity-based shock propagation for multibody dynamics animation, {eid: 34547260224}>, <Robot collisions: A survey on detection, isolation, and identification, {eid: 85031806485}>, <A new coriolis matrix factorization, {eid: 84864438757}>, <Six-DOF impedance control based on angle/axis representations, {eid: 0032688337}>, <Stiffness identification for serial robot manipulator based on uncertainty approach, {eid: 84855411342}>, <None, {eid: 85101735661}>, <Extracting feasible robot parameters from dynamic coefficients using nonlinear optimizationmethods, {eid: 84977525156}>, <None, {eid: 84891583980}>, <Parallel particle swarm optimization on graphical processing unit for pose estimation, {eid: 84866986397}>, <An overview of null space projections for redundant, torque-controlled robots, {eid: 84942112766}>, <Mass and friction optimization for natural motion in hands-on robotic surgery, {eid: 84954535021}>, <Parameter selection and adaptation in unified particle swarm optimization, {eid: 34247548801}>, <Reaction null space of amultibody system with applications in robotics, {eid: 84897808915}>, <Optimal motion planning of a space robot with base disturbance minimization, {eid: 84897767365}>, <The fast research interface for the kuka lightweight robot, {eid: 78649663145}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,5/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85101785830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A digital twin (DT) is an advanced virtual factory technology that has simulation as its core technical functionality, which it performs in the type and instance stages of the physical asset. For providing an efficient information object to the DT application, this paper proposes Virtual REpresentation for a DIgital twin application (VREDI): an asset description for the operation procedures of a work-center-level DT application. For the successful application of DT as a smart factory technology, VREDI is designed to meet four core technical requirements—DT definition, AAS property inheritance, improving the existing asset description, and supporting DT-based technical functionalities. Based on the analysis of the technical requirements, the elements of VREDI are derived and the reference relationships between them are designed. It is then possible to provide the required technical functionality using the VREDI header, and a detailed P4R structure and elements of the body are defined. VREDI is applied to the concept to support the main properties of the DT. It is designed to inherit the AAS properties for efficient information management and interoperability. The application of advanced concepts such as “type and instance” and supporting vertical integration and horizontal coordination overcomes the limitations of the existing asset descriptions. Additionally, VREDI designates elements for supporting six DT-based technical functionalities in the type and instance stages of the physical work center.","Asset description, Digital twin,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is known to be a complex system because of its severe constraints as it controls critical applications. It is difficult to manage such networks and keep control of all the variables impacting their operation during their whole lifecycle. Meanwhile, Digital Twinning technology has been increasingly used to optimize the performances of industrial systems and has been ranked as one of the top ten most promising technological trends in the next decade. Many Digital Twins of industrial systems exist nowadays but only few are destined to networks. In this paper, we propose a holistic digital twinning architecture for the IIoT where the network is integrated along with the other industrial components of the system. To do so, the concept of Network Digital Twin is introduced. The main motivation is to permit a closed-loop network management across the whole network lifecycle, from the design to the service phase. Our architecture leverages the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm as an expression of network softwarization. Mainly, the SDN controller allows for setting up the connection between each Digital Twin of the industrial system and its physical counterpart. We validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture in the process of choosing the most suitable communication mechanism that satisfies the real-time requirements of a Flexible Production System.","Digital Twining, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, Software Defined Networks",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85057495661}>, <Smart factory performance and Industry 4.0, {eid: 85074301976}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry, {eid: 85065156908}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <Digital Twin and Big Data Towards Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: 360 Degree Comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Numerical investigation of the interaction, transport and deposition of multicom-ponent droplets in a simple mouth-throat model, {eid: 85007417139}>, <Systems engineering and digital twin: A vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations, {eid: 85074479906}>, <None, {eid: 85120774828}>, <None, {eid: 85120826366}>, <Disaster City Digital Twin: A vision for integrating artificial and human intelligence for disaster management, {eid: 85077166289}>, <Reengineering aircraft structural life prediction using a digital twin, {eid: 84855216556}>, <A Maturity Model for Digital Twin Implementations in the Commercial Aerospace OEM Industry, {eid: 85113740805}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Smart factory use case model based on digital twin, {eid: 85052236749}>, <Intelligent digital twin-based software-defined vehicular networks, {eid: 85087066942}>, <Digital Twin Network: Concepts and Reference Architecture, {eid: 85122777422}>, <Digital twin for 5G and beyond, {eid: 85102889168}>, <Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey, {eid: 84919935425}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling Innovation in Campus Networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <Improving network management with software defined networking, {eid: 84873897891}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The Development of Digital Twin Technology Review, {eid: 85100925523}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Digital twin: Manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Robust Additive Manufacturing Performance through a Control Oriented Digital Twin, {eid: 85104769822}>, <DT-II:Digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet reference framework towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85073509951}>, <Application-Driven Network-Aware Digital Twin Management in Industrial Edge Environments, {eid: 85103239228}>, <None, {eid: 85105575085}>, <None, {eid: 70349510694}>, <Murphy loves potatoes: Experiences from a pilot sensor network deployment in precision agriculture, {eid: 33847162489}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <None, {eid: 77955557900}>, <None, {eid: 85030326793}>, <SDN-WISE: Design, prototyping and experimentation of a stateful SDN solution for WIreless SEnsor networks, {eid: 84954204152}>, <SD-WISE: A Software-Defined WIreless SEnsor network, {eid: 85065823154}>, <From IEEE 802.15.4 to IEEE 802.15.4e: A Step Towards the Internet of Things, {eid: 84903692507}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e: A survey, {eid: 84973662796}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e in a Nutshell: Survey and Performance Evaluation, {eid: 85041409643}>, <Traffic Aware Scheduling Algorithm for Reliable Low-Power Multi-Hop IEEE 802.15.4e Networks, {eid: 84871986780}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2021,,,,,,34960288,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85120812912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing software frameworks for digital twins mainly operate in the cloud and are based on platform-specific solutions, harming interoperability and adaptability. However, it is getting recognized that Internet of Things and digital twins architectures can take advantage of microservices and platform-independent distributed architectures (also on the edge), promoting higher scalability, adaptability, and interoperability. In this context, we introduce WLDT (White Label Digital Twins), a general-purpose library that allows developers to create digital twins in terms of modular, adaptable, and inter-operable software agents. Among different features, WLDT library supports multiple standard protocols, caching, software processing pipeline and metrics monitoring.","Digital twin, Internet of Things, Library, Software agent",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin in the IoT context: A survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models, {eid: 85087488936, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2020.2998530}>, <Product lifecycle management: driving the next generation of lean thinking, {eid: 43149121274}>, <Digital twin – proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <None, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Digital twin of a cutting tool, {eid: 85049590588, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.178}>, <Make more digital twins, {eid: 85072672277, doi: 10.1038/d41586-019-02849-1}>, <MQTT Version 3.1.1, {eid: 84940984266}>, <The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), {eid: 78650911380, doi: 10.17487/RFC7252}>, <Microservices architecture enables DevOps: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741, doi: 10.1109/MS.2016.64}>, <A sidecar object for the optimized communication between edge and cloud in internet of things applications, {eid: 85070090849, doi: 10.3390/fi11070145}>, <Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format, {eid: 84881399578, doi: 10.17487/RFC6690}>, <Reusable interface definitions for constrained restful environments, {eid: 84983080181}>, <Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML), {eid: 85068863872, doi: 10.17487/RFC8428}>, <Dyme: Dynamic microservice scheduling in edge computing enabled IoT, {eid: 85089309950, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2020.2981958}>, <Mobile edge computing: A survey on architecture and computation offloading, {eid: 85028360031, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2017.2682318}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,1/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85100120984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.","architecture,

The high participation of each stakeholder in this type of product production places a higher requirement on sufficient collaboration among social, cyber and physical spaces. However, under a decentralised social manufacturing network, the management of SMRs has encountered some real-life challenges in terms of their distributed and heterogeneous features. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform (BcDTCP) as an integrated solution to address these challenges. A hybrid domain-driven design method is presented to design and implement business-knowledge driven systems. To address the heterogeneity of SMRs, a ubiquitous object structure is designed to flexibly adjust the functionality of the digital twin. Blockchain is introduced to construct a peer-to-peer network to organise the SMRs in a decentralised manner. Additionally, a timed coloured Petri net-based workflow is adopted to formulise the collaboration logic into a smart contract executed on the blockchain. Finally, a demonstrative case study is conducted to verify and evaluate the proposed BcDTCP under a 3D printing scenario.","Blockchain, digital twin, domain driven design, resource collaboration,

However, many small and middle enterprises (SMEs) still rely on traditional manufacturing patterns in which they can hardly servitise manufacturing resources due to the limited budget and poor digitalisation capability. To servitise manufacturing resources, this paper proposes unified five-layer blockchain-enabled secure digital twin platform architecture, followed by its core enabling components and technologies. Firstly, a service-oriented digital twinning model is developed to transform physical resources into digital services. Secondly, a rule-based off-chain matching mechanism is designed to bridge customers’ orders with manufacturing services. Thirdly, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is adopted as the major methodology to design and develop the whole blockchain platform. Four blockchain frontend services are developed using React.js, whilst the blockchain backend is developed using private Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Finally, an experimental case is conducted based on the 3D printing scenario to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform, named imseStudio. The results show that it not only provides an effective solution to digitalise manufacturing resources but also promotes the transformation towards service manufacturing. Highlights Blockchain-enabled secure digital twin platform is developed to servitise manufacturing resources Service-oriented digital twinning model is developed to transform physical resources into digital services Rule-based off-chain matching mechanism is built to bridge customers’ orders with 3D printer Four blockchain explorers are developed to facilitate 3D printing services.","3D printing
