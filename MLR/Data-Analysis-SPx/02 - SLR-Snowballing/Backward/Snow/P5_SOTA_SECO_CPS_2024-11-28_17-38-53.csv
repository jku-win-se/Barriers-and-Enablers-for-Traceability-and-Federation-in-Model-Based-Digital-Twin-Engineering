We present a cloud based cyber-physical architecture to leverage the Sensing as-a-Service (SenAS) model, where every physical thing is complemented by a cloud based twin cyber process. In this model, things can communicate using direct physical connections or through the cyber layer using peer-to-peer inter process communications. The proposed model offers simultaneous communication channels among groups of things by uniquely tagging each group with a relationship ID. An intelligent service layer ensures custom privacy and access rights management for the sensor owners. We also present the implementation details of an IoT platform and demonstrate its practicality by developing case study applications for the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and the connected smart home.","Connected Smart Home, Cyber-Physical Systems, Emulator, Internet-of-Things, Sensing-as-a-Service, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks",,,,,,,,"<Internet of things (iot): A vision, architectural elements, future directions, {eid: 84876943063}>, <The social internet of things (siot)-when social networks meet the internet of things: Concept, architecture and network characterization, {eid: 84866034380}>, <None, {eid: 84924568062}>, <Sensing as a service model for smart cities supported by internet of things, {eid: 84900641617}>, <Smart city and the applications, {eid: 81455144799}>, <Smart city components architicture, {eid: 74549135678}>, <Sharing using social networks in a composable web of things, {eid: 77954004382}>, <Smart-Its Friends: A technique for users to easily establish connections between smart artefacts, {eid: 84945588227}>, <Future internet of things architecture: Like mankind neural system or social organization framework?, {eid: 79954631342}>, <Things that twitter: Social networks and the internet of things, {eid: 84869754927}>, <Siot: Giving a social structure to the internet of things, {eid: 82155166351}>, <Saddik Tnote: A social network of vehicles under internet of things, {eid: 84906342375}>, <Vedi: A vehicular crowd-sourced video social network for vanets, {eid: 84932648968}>, <Toward social internet of vehicles: Concept, architecture, applications, {eid: 84959852010}>, <Intelligent transportation systems based on internet-connected vehicles: Fundamental research areas and challenges, {eid: 81055137188}>, <Workload model based dynamic adaptation of social internet of vehicles, {eid: 84941757335}>, <Cyberphysical systems: The next computing revolution, {eid: 77956217277}>, <Vanet based vehicle tracking module for safe and efficient road transportation system, {eid: 84931317930}>, <A comprehensive ontology for knowledge representation in the internet of things, {eid: 84868150948}>, <Ontologies for the internet of things, {eid: 84856682702}>, <Sumo-Simulation of urban mobility-an overview, {eid: 84863691319}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,12/14/2015,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84969627262

This paper proposes an approach of modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing. Firstly, the concept and extension of the digital twin in the manufacturing context are elaborated to provide the implementation methods of virtual-physical convergence and information integration for a factory. Secondly, the modelling approaches of product digital twins, process digital twins and operation digital twins are presented, then the interoperation mode between these digital twins are explained. Thirdly, to elaborate how to execute operations between product, process and resource, Automation Markup Language (AutomationML) is used for modelling a structural parts machining cell. Finally, the performance evaluation is provided to demonstrate the improvement of production efficiency by using the proposed approach.","aerospace structural parts, Digital twin, enterprise

The aim of this manuscript is to illustrate the influencing factors for the self-discharge, especially the influence of time in which the cells stay unused. The self-discharge behavior of nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC)/graphite cells can be reproduced with three models for different time horizons: short, long, and overall time. The models are based on an approach originating from alkaline battery modeling. Some arguments justifying the validity of the approach are stated. The models are parameterized utilizing long time measurement data (160 days) obtained at different temperature and state of charge conditions. Limits of the models are discussed and quantified with simultaneous 99% confidence and prediction bands, that are constructed by means of nonlinear regression. A good agreement of the models and the measurements as well as narrow confidence and prediction band widths can be found.","Lithium-ion battery, Nonlinear regression, Self-discharge modeling, Voltage decay",,,,,,,,"<Mechanism of self-discharge in graphite-lithium anode, {eid: 0036471872, doi: 10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00827-1}>, <Self-discharge losses in lithium-ion cells, {eid: 1642384286, doi: 10.1109/MAES.2004.1269687}>, <A novel and fast method of characterizing the self-discharge behavior of lithium-ion cells using a pulse-measurement technique, {eid: 84910048619, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.163}>, <Modeling reversible self-discharge in series-connected li-ion battery cells, {eid: 84883704399, doi: 10.1109/TENCONSpring.2013.6584489}>, <Understanding anomalous behavior in coulombic efficiency measurements on li-ion batteries, {eid: 84923335119, doi: 10.1149/2.0191503jes}>, <Systematic aging of commercial LiFePO4/graphite cylindrical cells including a theory explaining rise of capacity during aging, {eid: 85012079907, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.133}>, <New method evaluating currents keeping the voltage constant for fast and highly resolved measurement of Arrhenius relation and capacity fade, {eid: 85017109856, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.136}>, <Generalized model for self-discharge processes in alkaline batteries, {eid: 84897367814, doi: 10.1149/2.081208jes}>, <Thermodynamics and kinetics of self-discharge in graphite-lithium electrodes, {eid: 84948651881, doi: 10.1109/BCAA.2002.986387}>, <The role of Li-ion battery electrolyte reactivity in performance decline and self-discharge, {eid: 0038010274, doi: 10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00149-6}>, <MATLAB 7.13.0 (R2011b), Natick, MA, USA, {eid: 85050259906}>, <Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications, {eid: 0003456815, doi: 10.1002/9780470316757}>, <Randwertproblemmethoden zur Parameteridentifizierung in Systemen nichtlinearer Differentialgleichungen, {eid: 0012900481}>, <Investigation on the self-discharge of the LiFePO4/C nanophosphate battery chemistry at different conditions, {eid: 84916226023, doi: 10.1109/ITEC-AP.2014.6940762}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,10/1/2018,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85050295357

The integration of digital twins into productive cyber-physical cloud manufacturing (CPCM) systems imposes strong demands such as reducing overhead and saving resources. In this paper, we develop and investigate a new method for building cloud-based digital twins (CBDT), which can be adapted to the CPCM platform. Our method helps reduce computing resources in the information processing center for efficient interactions between human users and physical machines. We introduce a knowledge resource center (KRC) built on a cloud server for information intensive applications. An information model for one type of 3D printers is designed and integrated into the core of the KRC as a shared resource. Several experiments are conducted and the results show that the CBDT has an excellent performance compared to existing methods.","Cloud Manufacturing, Digital Twin, MT Connect, Smart Manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Cloud manufacturing a new manufacturing paradigm, {eid: 84892430418, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2012.683812}>, <Web-based virtual operating of {CNC} milling machine tools, {eid: 70349451872}>, <Current status and advancement of cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84928606583}>, <The cyber-physical e-machine manufacturing system: Virtual engineering for complete lifecycle support, {eid: 85028642327}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756069}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <None, {eid: 85052866975}>, <None, {eid: 84941199454}>, <Delay-cost tradeoff for virtual machine migration in cloud data centers, {eid: 84996772808}>, <None, {eid: 85052887071}>, <Quantifying the performance of mt-connect in a distributed manufacturing environment, {eid: 82155188813, doi: 10.1115/DETC2009-86666}>, <Mtconnect-based kaizen for machine tool processes, {eid: 80054974231, doi: 10.1115/DETC2010-28763}>, <Improving machine tool interoperability using standardized interface protocols: Mt connect, {eid: 77955553954}>, <From cloud computing to cloud manufacturing, {eid: 80052032966}>, <Strategies for minimum energy operation for precision machining, {eid: 77955311801}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Cloud manufacturing: Strategic vision and state-of-the-art, {eid: 84888362486}>, <Cloud-based design and manufacturing: A new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation, {eid: 84906832119}>, <None, {eid: 85052856216}>, <None, {eid: 85052900169}>, <Cyber-physical manufacturing cloud: Architecture, virtualiza-tion, communication, and testbed, {eid: 85018178147}>, <Real-time communication for manufacturing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85046398205, doi: 10.1109/NCA.2017.8171361}>, <None, {eid: 85029429733}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,6/18/2018,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85052894576

Compared to combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles bring along new challenges in the CPS design. This paper gives an overview of several of these challenges and presents initial and potential solutions for the design of the electric powertrain and E/E architectures for electric vehicles. The powertrain consists of multiple complex CPS such as the battery, the electric motor, and a distributed energy management system. These components require a complex monitoring and control in order to guarantee safety and maintain a high efficiency. For this purpose, novel E/E architectures become necessary that facilitate a predictable distributed computation and communication, requiring a paradigm shift towards fully time-triggered systems. These E/E architectures will also enable novel CPS such as innovative driver assistance systems, x-by-wire control to further increase the safety and energy-efficiency of electric vehicles, and a pervasive interaction of the vehicle and the grid. Instead of focusing on the specific applications, this paper describes the prerequisite architectural changes that are necessary to implement these novel functions. © 2012 IEEE.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Electric Vehicles, Embedded Systems",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84877382483}>, <None, {eid: 33750955777}>, <None, {eid: 84872949259}>, <FlexRay startet durch - FlexRay-Bordnetz fuer Fahrdynamik und Fahrerassistenzsysteme, {eid: 79957538428}>, <None, {eid: 84872900504}>, <None, {eid: 17744392491}>, <Challenges in a Future IP/Ethernet-based in-car Network for Real-time Applications, {eid: 80052671473}>, <None, {eid: 84872976956}>, <None, {eid: 84872912600}>, <Modular Scheduling of Distributed Heterogeneous Time-triggered Automotive Systems, {eid: 84859976339}>, <Switched FlexRay - Increasing the Effective Bandwidth and Safety of FlexRay Networks, {eid: 78650581439}>, <FlexRay Switch Scheduling A Networking Concept for Electric Vehicles, {eid: 79957578700}>, <RTOS Support for Parallel Execution of Hard Real-Time Applications on the MERASA Multi-core Processor, {eid: 77954782358}>, <Multi-source and Multicore Automotive ECUs-OS Protection Mechanisms and Scheduling, {eid: 78650409152}>, <An Integrated Architecture for Future Car Generations, {eid: 33744465228}>, <System level performance analysis for real-time automotive multicore and network architectures, {eid: 67650921132}>, <None, {eid: 84872947389}>, <None, {eid: 84872924718}>, <None, {eid: 84872934793}>, <PharOS, a Multicore OS Ready for Safety-related Automotive Systems: Results and Future Prospects, {eid: 84877162961}>, <Corey: An Operating System for Many Cores, {eid: 85076887997}>, <Factored Operating Systems (FOS): The Case for a Scalable Operating System for Multicores, {eid: 70749153686}>, <The Multikernel: A New OS Architecture for Scalable Multicore Systems, {eid: 72249097688}>, <Real-time Scheduling on Multicore Platforms, {eid: 33749608101}>, <Enhancing Operating System Support for Multicore Processors by Using Hardware Performance Monitoring, {eid: 77952247820}>, <A Methodology to Design Programmable Embedded Systems, {eid: 0345381610}>, <Combined System Synthesis and Communication Architecture Exploration for MPSoCs, {eid: 70350043908}>, <SAT-Decoding, {eid: 49549121254}>, <Batteries and Battery Management Systems for Electric Vehicles, {eid: 84862106975}>, <Battery Balancing Methods: A Comprehensive Review, {eid: 57849143401}>, <Extended Kalman filtering for battery management systems of LiPB-based HEV battery packs Part 1.

New drive train concepts with Li-Ion battery system as central component arise. Nowadays, efforts are made to monitor the battery system in order to ensure maximum safety and reliability. But still, many parts of the life cycle of a battery system are not under accurate supervision. This paper proposes a digital twin architecture for automotive battery systems, on which digital services for various stakeholders along the manufacturing and product life cycle of a battery system can be established. Those services make use of the digital twin as a backbone, close open gaps and enable novel approaches in manufacturing and product use. The results feature an UML meta model as a first step toward implementing of a digital twin for battery systems. The meta model reflects the proposed architecture and allows domain-specific models to be built. The models in turn can act as blueprint for the implementation of the digital twin paradigm over the whole life cycle.","Architecture, Battery System, Digital Twin, UML Model",,,,,,,,"<Automotive revolution & perspective towards 2030, {eid: 85029538241, doi: 10.1365/s40112-016-1117-8}>, <Die automotive Agenda der Zukunft-Automobilzulieferer vor immensen Herausforderungen, {eid: 85070862942}>, <From vision to reality: Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84992510993}>, <A cyber physical interface for automation systems-methodology and examples, {eid: 85048391353, doi: 10.3390/machines3020093}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461, doi: 10.1109/DSD.2012.39}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing : A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <The air force digital thread/digital twin-life cycle integration and use of computational and experimental knowledge, {eid: 85007463616, doi: 10.2514/6.2016-0897}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Cloudconnected battery management for decision making on second-life of electric vehicle batteries, {eid: 85048526707, doi: 10.1109/EVER.2018.8362355}>, <Future modeling and simulation of cps-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.168}>, <Simulation-based identification of critical scenarios for cooperative and automated vehicles, {eid: 85045528477, doi: 10.4271/2018-01-1066}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85015767302, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006}>, <A domain-specific modeling language for electric vehicle batteries, {eid: 85070934866}>, <Enhanced data models for master and transaction data in ERP systems-unitary structuring approach, {eid: 70350199461}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <Main aging mechanisms in Li ion batteries, {eid: 24944549062, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.172}>, <None, {eid: 85057596443}>, <Anforderungen an Batterien für die Elektromobilit ät, {eid: 84979661720, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-30653-2.32}>, <None, {eid: 84975811561, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-30653-2}>, <None, {eid: 84937877628}>, <Aktueller begriff industrie 4.0, {eid: 85070905720}>, <New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing: Framework and characteristics, {eid: 85029168787, doi: 10.1109/TSMC.2017.2723764}>, <Services : SOA Microservices und Selfcontained Systems, {eid: 85070870946}>, <Design of emerging digital services: A taxonomy, {eid: 56749085318, doi: 10.1057/ejis.2008.38}>, <None, {eid: 65349136640, doi: 10.1007/3-540-28582-2}>, <Degradation mechanisms and lifetime prediction for lithiumion batteries & A control perspective, {eid: 84940927478, doi: 10.1109/ACC.2015.7170820}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/6/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85070853718

Since a centralized digital twin system uses too big resources and energies, it is preferable to make large-scale digital twin system geographically and logically distributed over the Internet. In addition, efficient interworking functions between digital twins and the physical systems are required also. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of large-scale digital twin platform including distributed digital twin cooperation framework, flexible data-centric communication middleware, and the platform based digital twin application to develop a reliable advanced driver assistance system.","ADAS, Communication Middleware, CPS, Digital twin, Modeling&Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Design techniques and applications of cyberphysical systems: A survey, {eid: 85028199291}>, <WiP abstract: From design to operation of a large-scale CPS, {eid: 84861487684}>, <None, {eid: 85028076136}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Cyber physical system: Design challenges, {eid: 70449466750}>, <Hybrid systems tools for compiling controllers for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84862138577}>, <Pessoa 2. 0: A controller synthesis tool for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 79956015420}>, <Mathematical equations as executable models of mechanical systems, {eid: 77954604308}>, <None, {eid: 78649267729}>, <None, {eid: 0012345221}>, <None, {eid: 84940984266}>, <Real-time CORBA, {eid: 0034291350}>, <Multidisciplinary modelling and simulation speeds development of automotive system and software, {eid: 85028080130}>, <Functional mock-up interface for model exchange and co-simulation version 2. 0, {eid: 85028057639}>, <Modelica-enabled rapid prototyping of cyber-physical energy systems via the functional mockup interface, {eid: 84889051897}>, <Distributed hybrid simulation using the HLA and the functional mock-up interface, {eid: 84893555611}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,7/4/2017,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85028079218
