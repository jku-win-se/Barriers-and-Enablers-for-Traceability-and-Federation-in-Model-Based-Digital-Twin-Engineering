Such hospitals look to improve operational efficiency and productivity to be able to treat more patients without increasing cost and justify the capital investment. Put simply, the hospital staff will in future co-work and collaborate with robotic technologies in a shared workspace to deliver the same level of patient care if not better. For this to happen, there is a need to appreciate how the current human effort can be integrated seamlessly with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) activities in a hospital setting and to visually show to the operations/logistics personnel the attendant challenges/ bottlenecks. We study a Greenfield hospital in Singapore and provide a digital twin of its future operations with RPA solutions. Specifically, we design an efficient logistics system (central sterile services, materials management, food, pharmacy, linen), develop robust RPA solutions, and minimize the disruptions from automation introduction. The transportation system within the hospital, dispatching rule of the lifts and robots, are optimized through extensive simulation.","Digital twinning, Hospitals, Logistics, Simulation, Singapore",,,,,,,,"<""On the concept of health capital and the demand for health"", {eid: 0000252351}>, <""Managing health care organizations: where professionalism meets complexity science"", {eid: 0033995008}>, <6 big benefits of applying automation to healthcare, {eid: 85081401696}>, <""Robotics in Logistics: A DPDHL Perspective on Implications and Use Cases for the Logistics Industry"", {eid: 85063581690}>, <Population Health Management: A Roadmap for Provider-Based Automation in a New Era of Healthcare, {eid: 85081359339}>, <""Patient flow modelling and performance analysis of healthcare delivery processes in hospitals: A review and reflections"", {eid: 84912522613}>, <""A formal approach to workflow analysis"", {eid: 0034384404}>, <""On fair routing from emergency departments to hospital wards: QED queues with heterogeneous servers"", {eid: 84864074121}>, <""Digital twin-driven product design framework"", {eid: 85061021953}>",,,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research,,,2/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85081348883

Digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. Although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. The main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technologies in healthcare. After providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.","Agents, Digital twin, Healthcare, MAS, Trauma management",,,,,,,,"<On behalf of the Swedish digital twin consortium: digital twins to personalize medicine, {eid: 85077448104, doi: 10.1186/s13073-019-0701-3}>, <Multi-agent oriented programming with jacamo, {eid: 84875735836, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2011.10.004}>, <Digital twin—the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <A personal medical digital assistant agent for supporting human operators in emergency scenarios, {eid: 85036626515}>, <Bdi personal medical assistant agents: the case of trauma tracking and alerting, {eid: 85058662276, doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2018.12.002}>, <None, {eid: 0004197808}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A novel cloud-based framework for the elderly healthcare services using digital twin, {eid: 85065103886, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909828}>, <Synthetic ppg generation from haemodynamic model with baroreflex autoregulation: A digital twin of cardiovascular system, {eid: 85077890925}>, <Pervasive tracking for time-dependent acute patient flow: A case study in trauma management, {eid: 85070984457}>, <Real-time tracking and documentation in trauma management, {eid: 85061744374}>, <Agent-based modeling for the self-management of chronic diseases: an exploratory study, {eid: 85027678799, doi: 10.1177/0037549717712605}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <None, {eid: 85088935302}>, <Artifacts in the A&A meta-model for multi-agent systems, {eid: 52949149709}>, <Augmented societies with mirror worlds, {eid: 85039554084, doi: 10.1007/s00146-017-0788-2}>, <Mirror worlds as agent societies situated in mixed reality environments, {eid: 84951094941}>, <None, {eid: 84962306691}>, <Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <The digital twin: realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2016.11.152}>, <None, {eid: 85079052784}>",,,Springer,,,9/1/2020,,,,,,32748066,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85088988374
