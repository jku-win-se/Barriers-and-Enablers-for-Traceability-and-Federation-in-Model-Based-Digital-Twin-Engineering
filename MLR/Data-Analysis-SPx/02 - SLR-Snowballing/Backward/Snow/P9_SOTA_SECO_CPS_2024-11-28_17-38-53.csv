Zarb School of Business, Hofstra University>",,"© 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.With the technology development in cyber physical systems and big data, there are huge potential to apply them to achieve personalization and improve resource efficiency in Industry 4.0. As Industry 4.0 is the relatively new concept originated from an advanced manufacturing vision supported by the German government in 2011, there are only several existing surveys on either cyber physical systems or big data in Industry 4.0. In addition, there are much less surveys related to the intersection between cyber physical systems and big data in Industry 4.0. However, cyber physical systems are closely related to big data in nature. For example, cyber physical systems will continuously generate a large amount of data which requires the big data techniques to process and help to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. Therefore, we conduct this survey to bring more attention to this critical intersection and highlight the future research direction to achieve the fully autonomy in Industry 4.0.","big data, cloud

These decisions have a big impact on the resulting system design and realization. Making design decisions in this stage is a complex and risky task, because there are a lot of uncertainties regarding their impact on the system qualities. Moreover, in many cases, trade-offs have to be made when there are conflicting objectives. This paper presents a methodology to support decision making for evolutionary systems, to decide on the most suitable design. The focus is on the embedded part of a system. Information is structured with explicit relations, such that the realization of a design can be traced towards the concerns a stakeholder has for the system. This structure enables architects and designers to understand and reason about the impact of a design with a system-wide perspective. The method consists of a calibration step which imports a current design, a design exploration step in which designs are selected, and a decision step where the most suitable design is chosen. The methodology is demonstrated by exploring and revealing the trade-offs for platooning designs from the automotive domain.","Design decision support, Impact analysis, Model-based system design, Reasoning framework, Traceability",,,,,,,,"<Design reuse in manufacturing and services, {eid: 48549100340}>, <The growth of structural and functional complexity during evolution, {eid: 0002820310}>, <None, {eid: 84970018807}>, <None, {eid: 85081079649}>, <None, {eid: 27944498753}>, <The use of the key driver technique in the design of copiers, {eid: 84878053301}>, <Investigating relationships and semantic sets amongst system lifecycle properties (ilities), {eid: 84938572797}>, <None, {eid: 0003705586}>, <Scenario-based software architecture evaluation methods: An overview, {eid: 80051509722}>, <Architectural design decision: Existing models and tools, {eid: 74349083963}>, <A framework for classifying and comparing software architecture evaluation methods, {eid: 2942530486}>, <Boderc: Model-based design of high-tech systems: A collaborative research project for multi-disciplinary design analysis of high-tech systems, {eid: 84880914293}>, <A quality-driven systematic approach for architecting distributed software applications, {eid: 27844611786}>, <Multiple-domain design scorecards: A method for architecture generation and evaluation through interface characterization, {eid: 84866863585}>, <None, {eid: 84964966451}>, <Saam: A method for analyzing the properties of software architectures, {eid: 0028166456}>, <The architecture tradeoff analysis method, {eid: 84985008410}>, <None, {eid: 50249186591}>, <Introducing impact analysis for architectural decisions, {eid: 34250190997}>, <A knowledge domain structure to enable system wide reasoning and decision making, {eid: 85081083595}>, <None, {eid: 85028075723}>, <A fail-operational truck platooning architecture, {eid: 85028089927}>, <Exploring trade-offs between centralized versus decentralized automotive architectures using a virtual integration environment, {eid: 34047158786}>, <Systems and software engineering-Architecture description, {eid: 84928015555}>, <A methodology to design programmable embedded systems-the y-chart approach, {eid: 84949203155}>, <None, {eid: 85100683588}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081093306

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry.

Model inference techniques can be categorized as active or passive learning, constructing models by (dynamically) interacting with systems or (statically) analyzing traces, respectively. Application of those techniques in the industry is, however, hindered by the trade-off between learning time and completeness achieved (active learning) or by incomplete input logs (passive learning). We investigate the learning time/completeness achieved trade-off of active learning with a pilot study at ASML, provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. To resolve the trade-off we advocate extending active learning with execution logs and passive learning results.We apply the extended approach to eighteen components used in ASML TWINSCAN lithography machines. Compared to traditional active learning, our approach significantly reduces the active learning time. Moreover, it is capable of learning the behavior missed by the traditional active learning approach.","active learning, equivalence oracle, model inference, passive learning, reverse engineering, runtime logs",,,,,,,,"<Using finitestate models for log differencing, {eid: 85058335840}>, <Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples, {eid: 0023453626}>, <Refining active learning to increase behavioral coverage, {eid: 85064153511}>, <Interface protocol inference to aid understanding legacy software components, {eid: 85063091119}>, <Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, {eid: 0001677717}>, <Never-stop learning: Continuous validation of learned models for evolving systems through monitoring, {eid: 84903886826}>, <On the synthesis of finite-state machines from samples of their behavior, {eid: 84938806379}>, <Inference of regular languages using state merging algorithms with search, {eid: 19944414336}>, <None, {eid: 0003577917}>, <Test selection based on finite state models, {eid: 0026172995}>, <Language identification in the limit, {eid: 49949150022}>, <Formal verification of static software models in MDE: A systematic review, {eid: 84900008517}>, <None, {eid: 85056885539}>, <None, {eid: 0003620778}>, <Hybrid learning: Interface generation through static, dynamic, and symbolic analysis, {eid: 84881300723}>, <The TTT algorithm: A redundancy-free approach to active automata learning, {eid: 84921627713}>, <State-merging DFA induction algorithms with mandatory merge constraints, {eid: 56649105032}>, <Results of the abbadingo one DFA learning competition and a new evidence-driven state merging algorithm, {eid: 84947908042}>, <QUARK: Empirical assessment of automatonbased specification miners, {eid: 34948849748}>, <Learning extended FSA from software: An empirical assessment, {eid: 84863103938}>, <Efficient test-based model generation for legacy reactive systems, {eid: 19944391951}>, <Inferring regular languages in polynomial updated time, {eid: 0002655021}>, <Identifying regular languages in polynomial time, {eid: 0002655021}>, <Black box checking, {eid: 15844378350}>, <LearnLib: A framework for extrapolating behavioral models, {eid: 70350536587}>, <Inference of finite automata using homing sequences, {eid: 0001349185}>, <Guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering, {eid: 61849169018}>, <None, {eid: 85064173388}>, <Applying automata learning to embedded control software, {eid: 84949234963}>, <None, {eid: 85040588157}>, <Bigger is not always better: On the quality of hypotheses in active automata learning, {eid: 84949215167}>, <A survey of grammatical inference in software engineering, {eid: 84908351504}>, <Finite automata: Behavior and synthesis, {eid: 85064149373}>, <Model learning, {eid: 85010790123}>, <Enhancing automata learning by log-based metrics, {eid: 84977490093}>, <None, {eid: 84979530122}>, <Process discovery using integer linear programming, {eid: 77049092374}>, <None, {eid: 85064178054}>, <Flexfringe: A passive automaton learning package, {eid: 85040590726}>, <Inferring finite-state models with temporal constraints, {eid: 56249102132}>, <Automated comparison of statebased software models in terms of their language and structure, {eid: 84876138196}>, <Inferring extended finite state machine models from software executions, {eid: 84925003128}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2/24/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85064164636

Unlike existing approaches which normally rely on qualitative diagnosis models expressed in logic, our approach applies a learned quantitative model that is used to derive residuals. Based on these residuals a diagnosis model is generated and used for a root cause identification. The new solution has several advantages such as the easy integration of new machine learning algorithms into MBD, a seamless integration of qualitative models, and a significant speed-up of the diagnosis runtime.

The automated comparison of runtime execution metrics to reference ones provides a potential solution. We introduce the concept of software passports, intended to act as a signature construct for runtime performance behaviour of reference executions. Our software passport design is based on Extra-Functional Behaviour (EFB) metrics. Amongst such metrics, our focus has been especially on CPU time, read and write communication event counts of different processes. The notion of phases for systems with repetitive tasks during their execution and its fundamental role in our software passports has also been elaborated. We employ regression modelling of our collected data for comparative purposes. The comparison reveals inconsistencies between the execution at hand and the software passport, if present. Such inconsistencies are strong indicators for presence of performance anomalies. Our design is capable of detecting synthetically introduced performance anomalies to the real execution tracing data from a semiconductor photolithography machine.","Industrial cyber-physical systems, Performance anomaly detection, Regression modelling, Software passports",,,,,,,,"<A regression-based approach to scalability prediction, {eid: 57349116000}>, <Anomaly detection: A survey, {eid: 68049121093}>, <Model uncertainty, data mining and statistical inference, {eid: 1942422934}>, <Simultaneous wavelength selection and outlier detection in multivariate regression of near-infrared spectra, {eid: 14644414808}>, <Performance anomaly detection and bottleneck identification, {eid: 84938363675}>, <None, {eid: 0003454649}>, <Construction and use of linear regression models for processor performance analysis, {eid: 33748863916}>, <Accurate and efficient regression modeling for microar-chitectural performance and power prediction, {eid: 33846540871}>, <Methods of inference and learning for performance modeling of parallel applications, {eid: 34748909426}>, <On the effectiveness of communication-centric modelling of complex embedded systems, {eid: 85063871267}>, <Work-in-progress: Communication-centric analysis of complex embedded computing systems, {eid: 85059393560}>, <None, {eid: 85071515736}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,7/7/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85071500236

A Review of Hybrid Physics Guided Machine Learning Techniques with Cyber-Physical System (CPS) Focus,2020,IEEE Access,,,,,,,172,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987324,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987324,"<Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Manufacturing and Design Lab (MADLab), University at Buffalo>",,"© 2013 IEEE.A multitude of cyber-physical system (CPS) applications, including design, control, diagnosis, prognostics, and a host of other problems, are predicated on the assumption of model availability. There are mainly two approaches to modeling: Physics/Equation based modeling (Model-Based, MB) and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, there is a growing consensus that ML methodologies relying on data need to be coupled with prior scientific knowledge (or physics, MB) for modeling CPS. We refer to the paradigm that combines MB approaches with ML as hybrid learning methods. Hybrid modeling (HB) methods is a growing field within both the ML and scientific communities, and are recognized as an important emerging but nascent area of research. Recently, several works have attempted to merge MB and ML models for the complete exploitation of their combined potential. However, the research literature is scattered and unorganized. So, we make a meticulous and systematic attempt at organizing and standardizing the methods of combining ML and MB models. In addition to that, we outline five metrics for the comprehensive evaluation of hybrid models. Finally, we conclude by shedding some light on the challenges of hybrid models, which we, as a research community, should focus on for harnessing the full potential of hybrid models. An additional feature of this survey is that the hybrid modeling work has been discussed with a focus on modeling cyber-physical systems.","Cyber-physical systems, deep learning, deep neural networks,

One of these methodologies is set-based design (SBD), a concurrent design methodology well suited for complex systems subject to significant uncertainty. Since the 1990s, numerous private, public, and defense sector design programs have successfully implemented SBD. However, concerns regarding SBD's complexity, tendency toward qualitative methods, and lack of quantitative tools have limited its use. To address these issues, our research surveys 122 refereed journal articles and conference papers to assess SBD's state-of-practice and identify relevant research opportunities. To accomplish these tasks, we perform a structured literature review to identify and assess relevant and influential research. We found that SBD's state-of-practice relies heavily upon decision and tradespace analysis with increasing emphasis on uncertainty modeling and MBSE. We found that the majority of SBD research consists of quantitative methodologies focusing on component and small system applications. We also found that complex system applications used mostly qualitative methodologies. We identify SBD research opportunities for requirements development, MBSE, uncertainty modeling, multiresolution modeling, adversarial analysis, and program management. Finally, we recommend the development of a comprehensive SBD methodology and toolkit, suited for complex system design across all stages of the product development life cycle.","literature survey,

Manufacturing systems simulation has proven to be a powerful tool for designing and evaluating a manufacturing system due to its low cost, quick analysis, low risk and meaningful insight that it may provide, improving thus the understanding of the influence of each component. Simulation comprises an indispensable set of IT tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing. It allows experimentation and validation of product, process, and system design and configuration. This paper investigates the major historical milestones in the evolution of manufacturing systems simulation technologies and examines recent industrial and research approaches in key fields of manufacturing. It describes how the urge towards digitalisation of manufacturing in the context of the 4th Industrial revolution has shaped simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems and reviews the new approaches that have arisen in the literature. Particular focus is given to technologies in the digitalised factories of the future that are gaining ground in industrial applications simulation, offering multiple advantages.","digitalised manufacturing, information and communication technologies, manufacturing systems, review, simulation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85068586021}>, <None, {eid: 85068557679}>, <Modelling and Simulation of Manufacturing Process Chains, {eid: 84871691411}>, <Multidimensional Evaluation of the Changeability of Interlinked Production Processes with Material Flow Simulation, {eid: 84883895135}>, <ErgoToolkit: An Ergonomic Analysis Tool in a Virtual Manufacturing Environment, {eid: 84878686417}>, <Recent Advances in Augmented Reality, {eid: 0035503402}>, <None, {eid: 85068569873}>, <Developing and Applying AR Technology in Design, Production, Service and Training, {eid: 28244442026}>, <Hybrid Simulation for Complex Manufacturing Value-chain Environments, {eid: 85029845588}>, <Virtual Engineering of a Fusion Reactor: Application to Divertor Design, Manufacture, and Testing, {eid: 85052632583}>, <A roadmap for parametric CAD efficiency in the automotive industry, {eid: 84879198567}>, <Explicit Reference Modelling Methodology in Parametric CAD System, {eid: 84887995562}>, <Digital Twin—The Simulation Aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <None, {eid: 0004305643}>, <Advances in Modelling and Simulation of Grinding Processes, {eid: 72949124419}>, <Possibilities and Challenges for Proactive Manufacturing Ergonomics, {eid: 85052059498}>, <Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Five-link Underactuated 3-D Bipedal Robot, {eid: 60549118116}>, <MES Architecture for FMS Compatible to ERP, {eid: 0036574303}>, <None, {eid: 0004210859}>, <Verification of Human Factors in Manufacturing Process Design.

They differ from software antipatterns in their focus on the performance of the software. This paper addresses performance antipatterns that are common in today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). We describe the characteristics of today's CPS that cause performance problems that have been uncommon in real-time embedded systems of the past. Three new performance antipatterns are defined and their impact on CPS is described. Six previously defined performance antipatterns are described that are particularly relevant to today's CPS. The paper concludes with observations on how this work is useful in the design, implementation, and operation of CPS.","Cyber-physical systems design, Performance antipatterns, Software architecture, Software performance engineering (SPE)",,,,,,,,"<Performance-driven software model refactoring, {eid: 85029760730}>, <None, {eid: 84916610703}>, <Predicting the time to migrate into deadlock using a discrete time markov chain, {eid: 85052013230}>, <None, {eid: 0003885315}>, <None, {eid: 0004101993}>, <Wheres waldo: Uncovering hard-to-find application killers, {eid: 84883082487}>, <Digging into uml models to remove performance antipatterns, {eid: 77954569124}>, <A process to effectively identify ""guilty"" performance antipatterns, {eid: 77951262422}>, <Software performance antipatterns: Modeling and analysis, {eid: 84864361946}>, <None, {eid: 85006269717}>, <The sisyphus database retrieval performance antipattern, {eid: 0036992634}>, <None, {eid: 0004061016}>, <None, {eid: 0003880013}>, <Enabling performance modeling for the masses: Initial experiences, {eid: 85054884329}>, <Aggregate entity pattern, {eid: 84883076204}>, <None, {eid: 85085955792}>, <Engineering cyber-physical systems through performance-based modelling and analysis, {eid: 85085958854}>, <Detecting performance antipatterns in component based enterprise systems, {eid: 43049112407}>, <The more is less antipattern, {eid: 85085938729}>, <Software performance antipatterns, {eid: 0034593009}>, <New software performance antipatterns: More ways to shoot yourself in the foot, {eid: 85153673779}>, <None, {eid: 0003502856}>, <More new software antipatterns: Even more ways to shoot yourself in the foot, {eid: 84879766091}>, <None, {eid: 84883066208}>, <Detection and solution of software performance antipatterns in palladio architectural models, {eid: 79953880789}>, <Guilt-based handling of software performance antipatterns in palladio architectural models, {eid: 84905826841}>, <Exploiting load testing and profiling for performance antipattern detection, {eid: 85039063985}>, <Performance engineering of software architectures, {eid: 84944092741}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,4/20/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85085954136

An alternative approach consists of ensuring correctness by construction. We discuss the Rigorous System Design (RSD) approach, which relies on a sequence of semantics-preserving transformations to obtain an implementation of the system from a high-level model while preserving all the properties established along the way. In particular, we highlight some of the key requirements for the feasibility of such an approach, namely availability of (1) methods and tools for the design of correct-by-construction high-level models and (2) definition and proof of the validity of suitable domain-specific abstractions. We summarise the results of the extended versions of seven papers selected among those presented at the 1 st and the 2 nd International Workshops on Methods and Tools for Rigorous System Design (MeTRiD 2018–2019), indicating how they contribute to the advancement of the RSD approach.","Correct-by-construction, Domain-specific abstraction, High-level modelling, System design",,,,,,,,"<A general framework for architecture composability, {eid: 84950244711, doi: 10.1007/s00165-015-0349-8}>, <None, {eid: 85072855486}>, <CPSDebug: Automatic failure explanation in CPS models, {eid: 85099151119, doi: 10.1007/s10009-020-00599-4}>, <Software Architecture in Practice, {eid: 0004025223}>, <Modeling heterogeneous real-time components in BIP, {eid: 82655181592}>, <None, {eid: 84988555120}>, <Contracts for system design.

It requires the creation of system monitors, instrumentation for data collection, and the definition of constraints. All of these aspects need to evolve to accommodate changes in the system. However, most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors and constraints for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for evolving the monitoring infrastructure. Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS. In this 'new and emerging results' paper we propose a novel framework for model-integrated runtime monitoring. We combine model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate large parts of the monitoring framework and to reduce the maintenance effort necessary when parts of the monitored system change. We build a prototype and evaluate our approach against a system for controlling the flights of unmanned aerial vehicles.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Evolution, Model-Driven Engineering, Runtime Monitoring",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 3142731744}>, <The next generation of human-drone partnerships: Co-designing an emergency response system, {eid: 85086454234}>, <Model-driven requirements for humans-on-the-loop multi-uav missions, {eid: 85097308620}>, <Misuse cases: Use cases with hostile intent, {eid: 0037240812}>, <Fuzzy goals for requirementsdriven adaptation, {eid: 78650408637}>, <Models@run time: A guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955}>, <None, {eid: 85008066028}>, <Model-Driven software engineering in practice, second edition, {eid: 84880445741}>, <Distributed graph queries for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85045651901}>, <Distributed graph queries over models@ run time for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85074030886}>, <Java-MOP: A monitoring oriented programming environment for Java, {eid: 24644483315}>, <Dronology: An incubator for cyber-physical systems research, {eid: 85049695714}>, <None, {eid: 85115610627}>, <Flexible resource monitoring of Java programs, {eid: 84900816089}>, <Runtime verification for decentralised and distributed systems, {eid: 85042126523}>, <Goal-driven adaptation of servicebased systems from runtime monitoring data, {eid: 80054969989}>, <TemporalEMF: A temporal metamodeling framework, {eid: 85054785176}>, <Autonomous navigation of mobile robots in factory environment, {eid: 85083531436}>, <Creating user-specific business process monitoring dashboards with a model-driven approach, {eid: 85046689792}>, <Model-driven digital twin construction: Synthesizing the integration of cyber-physical systems with their information systems, {eid: 85096992990}>, <Coastal and environmental remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles: An overview, {eid: 84940913617}>, <Complex event processing in distributed systems, {eid: 0013176589}>, <Monitoring distributed systems, {eid: 0002587301}>, <Unmanned air vehicles for coastal and environmental research, {eid: 79953762168}>, <A domain analysis of resource and requirements monitoring: Towards a comprehensive model of the software monitoring domain, {eid: 85063754904}>, <Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): A survey on civil applications and key research challenges, {eid: 85065056485}>, <None, {eid: 85115638720}>, <Misbehaviour prediction for autonomous driving systems, {eid: 85094321490}>, <Varys: An agnostic model-driven monitoring-as-a-service framework for the cloud, {eid: 85071931151}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4, {eid: 85019987476}>, <The model transformation language of the VIATRA2 framework, {eid: 34548501253}>, <Monitoring CPS at runtime-A case study in the UAV domain, {eid: 85056510669}>, <Requirements monitoring frameworks: A systematic review, {eid: 84984972165}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,5/25/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85115603171

Adoption of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) continues to grow in industry and government, and MBSE continues to be a major research theme in the systems engineering community. In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.","literature review, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), value of systems engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85098444299}>, <None, {eid: 84969745906}>, <None, {eid: 85098450005}>, <None, {eid: 85095978973}>, <The SERC 5-year technical plan: designing the future of systems engineering research, {eid: 85098446608}>, <None, {eid: 85098444046}>, <A framework for agile development of simulation-based system design tools, {eid: 84883030308}>, <A model-based approach for requirements engineering for systems of systems, {eid: 85027919334}>, <MBSE in rail transportation–product families and product lines, {eid: 85063097750}>, <State-of-practice survey of model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85052963713}>, <Current modeling trends in systems engineering, {eid: 85044470320}>, <MBSE applicability analysis in Chinese industry, {eid: 85098450187}>, <MBSE applicability analysis, {eid: 84929802358}>, <Should I stay or should I go?
