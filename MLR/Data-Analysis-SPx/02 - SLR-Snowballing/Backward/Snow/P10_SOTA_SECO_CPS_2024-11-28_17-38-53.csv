Thereby, it reduces the required time and effort and enables new data-intensive use cases. This paper provides an abstract four-layer architecture pattern to construct digital twins and to incorporate information from various kinds of sources. The pattern is designed to be flexibly extensible with new information sources and can flexibly support new kinds of proprietary or standard information. We discuss various alternatives to implement the pattern and provide an example realization based on microservices and OPC UA.","Digital twin, Information model, Microservice, OPC UA",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85040537203}>, <None, {eid: 0004101993}>, <None, {eid: 85072820498}>, <Architectural aspects of Digital Twins in IIoT systems, {eid: 85055721125}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <A navigation framework for digital twins of factories based on building information modeling, {eid: 85044445847}>, <A digital twin based service oriented application for a 4.0 knowledge navigation in the smart factory, {eid: 85052893769}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <None, {eid: 85072845520}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,9/9/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85072820852

The most notable feature during this transition is the improvement of digitization and intelligence based on the massive data drives. In such a data-driven environment, the processing, storage, and utilization of the industry data get more and more important. Usually, the traditional data processing architecture runs as a one-way streamline, which cannot adapt to the different requirements of the multi-scenario application. This paper proposed a new industrial big data processing architecture called Phi architecture, which can realize many functions such as batch data processing and stream data processing, distributed storage and access, and real-time control. Compared with other data processing architecture, the Phi architecture combined with edge computing and feedback control has the ability to deal with the different demands in aviation manufacturing. Next, the new architecture is designed for microservices pattern, which improves the flexibility and stability of the architecture, and makes it independent operated in multi-scenarios, such as state monitoring of workshop, adaptive data acquisition, feedback control, and user-oriented information classification. As a proof of concept, the architecture has been tested in a simulation digital manufacturing workshop. The results verify the improved effectiveness of the Phi architecture on the data feedback control and real-time processing. And, the development of microservices architecture greatly improves the efficiency, adaptability, and extensibility of the manufacturing process.","Data processing architecture, edge computing, microservices, multi-scenario application, real-time feedback",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-physical microservices: An IoT-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602}>, <Intelligent manufacturing in the context of industry 4.0: A review, {eid: 85040743821}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <An ISA-95-based manufacturing intelligence system in support of lean initiatives, {eid: 84860902981}>, <Industry 4.0-An Introduction in the phenomenon, {eid: 85007014753}>, <Microservices, {eid: 84922850962}>, <None, {eid: 84877040956}>, <An improved cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0 smart factories, {eid: 85028538568}>, <A cloud-based cyber-physical system for adaptive shop-oor scheduling and condition-based maintenance, {eid: 85046843510}>, <Design and development of a CNC machining process knowledge base using cloud technology, {eid: 84983394789}>, <Data quality management, data usage experience and acquisition intention of big data analytics, {eid: 84899458050}>, <Survey of technologies for real time big data streams analytic, {eid: 85018567623}>, <A big data analytics architecture for cleaner manufacturing and maintenance processes of complex products, {eid: 84999036761}>, <A survey on real-time big data analytics: Applications and tools, {eid: 85017310925}>, <Benchmarking big data architectures for social networks data processing using public cloud platforms, {eid: 85049321697}>, <The lambda and the kappa, {eid: 85029792877}>, <Lambda architecture for real time big data analytic, {eid: 85018560206}>, <Lambda architecture for cost-effective batch and speed big data processing, {eid: 84963716008}>, <Ahab: A cloudbased distributed big data analytics framework for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84978970019}>, <Streaming process discovery for lambda architecture-based process monitoring platform, {eid: 85058024279}>, <Optimised Lambda Architecture for monitoring scienti-c infrastructure, {eid: 85068641426}>, <A manufacturing big data solution for active preventive maintenance, {eid: 85029445795}>, <Processing distributed Internet of Things data in clouds, {eid: 84928741396}>, <The emergence of edge computing, {eid: 85009446769}>, <Mobile-edge computing and the Internet of Things for consumers: Extending cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, {eid: 84989332751}>, <Secure data storage and searching for industrial IoT by integrating fog computing and cloud computing, {eid: 85041224602, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2793350}>, <Internet of Things and edge cloud computing roadmap for manufacturing, {eid: 84991248061}>, <Challenges and opportunities in edge computing, {eid: 85011060262}>, <Edge-centric computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 84977268028}>, <The promise of edge computing, {eid: 84969922595}>, <An edge computing architecture in the internet of things, {eid: 85051533206}>, <Fog computing for energy-aware load balancing and scheduling in smart factory, {eid: 85044350923}>, <Edge computing in IoT-based manufacturing, {eid: 85053451057}>, <EdgeIoT: Mobile edge computing for the Internet of Things, {eid: 85012981859}>, <A survey on the edge computing for the Internet of Things, {eid: 85037656743}>, <A cutting power model for tool wear monitoring in milling, {eid: 4544365515}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,1/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85068713238

Existing production architectures limit changeability, because programmable logic controllers (PLC) that are responsible for the execution of real-time production steps also define the order of production steps that are executed for every product. PLC programming therefore implicitly defines the production process. Consequently, any change of a production process requires changes in PLC code, causes potential side effects due to unknown controller dependencies, and requires extensive testing. We propose a service-based architecture approach that encapsulates production steps into re-useable services. Production cells invoke services, and comparable to multi-agent systems autonomously decide about optimal service invocations based on shared information. In this article, we outline our service-based architecture concept and describe a use-case that illustrates the decentral organization of production systems and the cooperative optimization of production steps.","Industrie 4.0, Self-optimizing, Self-reconfigurable, Service-based production, SoA",,,,,,,,"<The evolution of factory and building automation, {eid: 80054695924, doi: 10.1109/MIE.2011.942175}>, <Orchestration of service-oriented manufacturing processes, {eid: 33847276520}>, <Implementation of a process orchestration model in a service oriented holonic manufacturing system, {eid: 84992494534}>, <Towards a time-constrained web service infrastructure for industrial automation, {eid: 56349109468}>, <Separation of concerns on the orchestration of operations in flexible manufacturing, {eid: 84857583027, doi: 10.1108/01445151211198700}>, <Loosely-coupled automation systems using device-level SOA, {eid: 39749199109}>, <Plug & produce by modelling skills and service-oriented orchestration of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, {eid: 84946711970, doi: 10.1515/auto-2014-1157}>, <Context-based orchestration for control of resource-efficient manufacturing processes, {eid: 84887043308, doi: 10.3390/fi4030737}>, <Ontology-assisted engineering of cyberphysical production systems in the field of process technology, {eid: 85041839357, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2805320}>, <Details of the asset administration shell, {eid: 85088022986}>, <None, {eid: 71549160513}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,6/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85088024324

For existing buildings, the commissioned SCADA solutions provide historical trends, alarms management and setpoint curve adjustments, which are essential features for facility management personnel. The development in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, as well as software microservices enables higher system integration, data analytics and rich visualization to be integrated into the existing infrastructure. This paper presents the implementation of a technology stack, which can be used as a framework for improving existing and new building automation systems by increasing interconnection and integrating data analytics solutions.

Published by Elsevier B.V.More and more elements in a modern production system are becoming smart devices and it is reasonable to integrate them into a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) in a consistent manner. There is the broad goal of many industrial players to open the rich potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which has to be fast, secure and adaptive. The growing number of ""things"" in a production system requires satisfying connectivity solutions that are different to an easy coming ""Peer-to-Peer architecture (P2P)"". The approach followed at the smartfactory@tugraz - the Learning Factory of Graz University of Technology in Austria - to achieve such an integration is to deploy an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), which is at the core of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The goal is to integrate three main software applications including the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the Management Execution System (MES). The additional challenge in this project is that these mentioned main applications are all provided by different suppliers. The selected SOA approach provides the basis for a scalable and extensible solution via Connectivity Modules and standardized interfaces. The smartfactory@tugraz validates this SOA approach by applying it to a real and fully operational manufacturing line. The smartfactory@tugraz is not only a learning factory but rather an open ecosystem by offering both students and researchers as well as industrial partners the ability to perform research on this subject. It is thus the ideal place to study the challenges and to understand the benefits of pushing a CPPS to a mature level in terms of connectivity in a manufacturing context.","Connectivity, CPPS, ESB, OPC UA, Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P), Reference architecture, Service oriented architecture, Smart Factory, SOA Enterprise Service Bus",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise Architectures for the Digital Transformation in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, {eid: 85044637997}>, <Forschungsraum smartfactory@tugraz - Die Sichtbarmachung einer agilen Fertigung, {eid: 85065645479}>, <A critical review of smart manufacturing & Industry 4.0, {eid: 85055904167}>, <None, {eid: 85042671846}>, <None, {eid: 85065647748}>, <SOA and Web Services Interface Design, {eid: 85014273181}>, <Architecting Scalable Enterprise Web Applications, {eid: 85065660830}>, <None, {eid: 33744509965}>, <None, {eid: 85065665480}>, <Enterprise Service Bus, {eid: 85065635720}>, <Loose Coupling, {eid: 85065642717}>, <Whats in a Service?, {eid: 36749076301}>, <None, {eid: 85047244766}>, <None, {eid: 85065658338}>, <None, {eid: 85048818555}>, <Anwendungsbeispiele zur Integration heterogener Steuerungssysteme bei robotergestützten Industrieanlagen, {eid: 85068473205}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,3/26/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85065662522

Manufacturing systems and more specifically assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development, evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.","Assembly systems, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, IoT, Manufacturing system architecture, Microservices",,,,,,,,"<Analysis of the Methods Time Measurement (MTM) Methodology through its Application in Manufacturing Companies, {eid: 85063105349}>, <Decentralized control: Status and outlook, {eid: 84900474912}>, <Decision support for sequence generation in an assembly-oriented design environment, {eid: 2642553127}>, <Future trends in management and operation of assembly systems: From customized assembly systems to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85041918454}>, <Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing, {eid: 84900826011}>, <Assembly system design in the Industry 4.0 era: A general framework, {eid: 85031791393}>, <Multi-objective assembly line balancing considering component picking and ergonomic risk, {eid: 85028698266}>, <None, {eid: 85067527558}>, <IoT-based configurable information service platform for product lifecycle management, {eid: 84900809305}>, <Modelling and simulation of opportunistic IoT services with aggregate computing, {eid: 85053778744}>, <An advanced cyber physical framework for micro devices assembly, {eid: 85028458837}>, <Assembly system configuration through Industry 4.0 principles: The expected change in the actual paradigms, {eid: 85044859693}>, <A software platform for supporting the design and reconfiguration of versatile assembly systems, {eid: 85049560558}>, <A real-time service-oriented architecture for industrial automation, {eid: 69249218873}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Keeping track of the physical in assembly processes, {eid: 84992560957}>, <Toward opportunistic services for the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85044750246}>, <Assembly system design and operations for product variety, {eid: 80051668632}>, <Constraint-based interactive assembly planning, {eid: 0030675394}>, <Practical semantics for the Internet of Things: Physical states, device mashups, and open questions, {eid: 84962216157}>, <Product, process and system ontologies and knowledge base for managing knowledge between different clients, {eid: 70349108400}>, <Intelligent assembly system for mechanical products and key technology based on internet of things, {eid: 84908081564}>, <An ontology for the definition and validation of assembly processes for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 33746589988}>, <An integrated framework for design, management and operation of reconfigurable assembly systems, {eid: 85029542665}>, <None, {eid: 85063092036}>, <Configuration of smart environments made simple: Combining visual modeling with semantic metadata and reasoning, {eid: 84946175320}>, <Going solo: Hierarchical task analysis of the second driver in two-up (multi-person) freight rail operations, {eid: 85043606627}>, <Capability-based task allocation in human-robot collaboration, {eid: 85020859281}>, <Cyber-physical systems alter automation architectures, {eid: 84900498200}>, <AND/OR Graph representation of assembly plans, {eid: 0025418409}>, <None, {eid: 85063075495}>, <Hierarchical task analysis: Developments, applications, and extensions, {eid: 27744434006}>, <Secure integration of IoT and cloud computing, {eid: 85008227599}>, <A novel ontology-based service model for cyber physical system, {eid: 85039910158}>, <Extended liaison as an interface between product and process model in assembly, {eid: 84899671341}>, <Human-robot collaboration in cellular manufacturing: Design and development, {eid: 76249122509}>, <A Cyber-Physical system-based approach for industrial automation systems, {eid: 84931572168}>, <An open distributed architecture for flexible hybrid assembly systems: a model driven engineering approach, {eid: 84946771754}>, <A framework for MDE of IoT-based manufacturing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85063081388}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: An iot-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602}>, <Towards an IoT-based framework for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 85106545857}>, <Microservices, {eid: 84922850962}>, <Functional composition of sensor web APIs, {eid: 84892394014}>, <Efficient runtime service discovery and consumption with hyperlinked RESTdesc, {eid: 83755186092}>, <IoT and cloud computing in automation of assembly modelling systems, {eid: 84900815294}>, <Industry 4.0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <AutoAssem: An automated assembly planning system for complex products, {eid: 84864564598}>, <Object-oriented templates for automated assembly planning of complex products, {eid: 84898778091}>, <The internet of things for smart Manufacturing: a Review, IISE transactions, {eid: 85063081450}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,1/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85063085792

It became obvious that in modern days digitalization in each industry is an irreversible process and the speed of adopting of such kind of technologies in an appropriate manner will determine the evolution and survival of any business. Digital technologies play a crucial role in any domain of our life: from simple everyday activities, to such important domains like security, safety and health. We are the witnesses of so-called 'Industry 4.0 Revolution' which is dominated by Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Architectures with related technologies. When we think about big change or (r) evolution, we are looking mostly for advantages only, but don't care about challenges and what is happening under the hood. The truth is that 'reality is distributed' and the things are getting more complex with each passing day. The information systems are dealing with more and more (huge) amount of data, nevertheless, a quick response (in milliseconds) is expected and no downtime is accepted. In this context, the challenges consist first of all in designing and implementing a reliable (doing well what it was designed for), performant (quick reaction time), low-overhead (non-blocking and optimal use of resources) and flexible (adding new features with minimal effect upon production environment) systems. To implement a system with such kind of features a specific programming models need to be used. In this paper is proposed an architectural approach aimed to ensure scalability and extensibility of a distributed information systems using not fresh, but still very actual concept like Actor Model and REST. Modern Event-Driven, Asynchronous and non-blocking programming models are used.","Actor Model, Asynchronous, Cloud, Distributed Systems, Environment Monitoring, Event-Driven Architecture, Microservices, Reactive Systems, REST, Serverless Computing, System Architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003520264}>, <None, {eid: 84884364700}>, <None, {eid: 85056721278}>, <Software Evolution as SaaS: Evolution of Intelligent Design in Cloud, {eid: 85069168931}>, <None, {eid: 85069172306}>, <Cloud-based Architectures for Environment Monitoring, {eid: 85027520625}>, <Open Source Hardware as a Framework, {eid: 84890729757}>, <Sisteme Inteligente in Ecologie.

Management and connection to those things create integrability and usability issues. Hence, there is a need for a solution that facilitates the communication between different devices and platforms. The Web of Things (WoT) tries to handle interoperability issues by describing interfaces and interaction patterns among things. Thanks to the models proposed by the WoT, it is possible to decouple the description of things from the protocols handling the communication and implementation strategies. This article proposes Digital Dice as an abstraction of IoT devices inspired by the concept of Digital Twin, but capable of leveraging the advantages of microservices architectures. We focus on the creation of Digital Dices from WoT models. A Digital Dice consists in different facets that are able to handle a particular aspect of a thing, hence different WoT descriptions models will result in different microservices related to that particular thing. An architecture to handle multiple Digital Dices and their replicas is also proposed.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital Twins, IoT, Microservices, Web of Things",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075874070}>, <IoT middleware: A survey on issues and enabling technologies, {eid: 85015164749}>, <None, {eid: 85063569479}>, <None, {eid: 84855216556}>, <None, {eid: 85075858318}>, <None, {eid: 85075893888}>, <A survey on complex event definition languages in multimedia sensor networks, {eid: 85009817262}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <Feature-based survey of model transformation approaches, {eid: 33748289548}>, <None, {eid: 85011536918}>, <Microservice-based IoT for smart buildings, {eid: 85021424248}>, <An open IoT framework based on microservices architecture, {eid: 85015161312}>, <Architecture of an interoperable IoT platform based on microservices, {eid: 84983616702}>, <Niflheim: An end-to-end middleware for applications on a multi-tier IoT infrastructure, {eid: 85046428883}>, <None, {eid: 85075896851}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/28/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85075856524

It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry.

In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.","Data management framework, Factory floor, Industrial internet of things (IIoT), IoT middleware, Smart factory",,,,,,,,"<Challenges and research issues of data management in IoT for large-scale petrochemical plants, {eid: 85019839931}>, <Future IIOT in process automation-Latest trends of standardization in industrial automation, {eid: 84960194698}>, <An Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment, {eid: 84892717180}>, <An industrial big data pipeline for data-driven analytics maintenance applications in large-scale smart manufacturing facilities, {eid: 85013959166}>, <Failure detection and prevention for cyber-physical systems using ontology-based knowledge base, {eid: 85059283597}>, <Health assessment and life prediction of cutting tools based on support vector regression, {eid: 84925292228}>, <The evolution and future of manufacturing: A review, {eid: 84963772214}>, <Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems—Reviews, methodology and applications, {eid: 84887056149}>, <None, {eid: 55549116194}>, <None, {eid: 85070538697}>, <Restthing: A restful web service infrastructure for mash-up physical and web resources, {eid: 84862942051}>, <Data management for the Internet of Things: Design primitives and solution, {eid: 84887746858}>, <Middleware for internet of things: A survey, {eid: 84959420432}>, <Distributed data service for data management in internet of things middleware, {eid: 85018349860}>, <Part data integration in the Shop Floor Digital Twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201}>, <Smart factories in Industry 4.0: A review of the concept and of energy management approached in production based on the Internet of Things paradigm, {eid: 84988221092}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395}>, <None, {eid: 85070559440}>, <None, {eid: 84957605573}>, <None, {eid: 85070559277}>, <PwC 20 years inside the mind of the CEO . . .

The increasing connections of systems that produce high volumes of real time data have raised the need for advanced Data Exploration techniques able to face the impact of Big Data, in order to make remote monitoring services sustainable. In this paper, the IDEAaS (Interactive Data Exploration As-a-Service) approach is presented, apt to support and ease exploration of real time data in a dynamic context of interconnected systems, where large amounts of data must be incrementally collected, organised and analysed on-the-fly. The proposed approach relies on three main pillars: (i) a multi-dimensional organisation of data, for data exploration according to different analysis dimensions; (ii) data summarisation, based on incremental clustering algorithm, to provide summarised representation of collected data streams; (iii) data relevance evaluation techniques, to attract the users attention on relevant data only during exploration. Finally, the approach has been tested in a Smart Factory context, applying the interactive data exploration techniques in order to assist anomaly detection in remote monitoring services.","Big data, Data exploration, Industry 4.0, Internet of Services, Internet of Things, Service oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<A framework for clustering evolving data streams, {eid: 85012236181}>, <A relevance-based approach for big data exploration, {eid: 85067063206, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.05.056}>, <Interactive data exploration as a service for the smart factory, {eid: 85032351209}>, <A proposed architecture for big data driven syupply chain analytics, {eid: 85021202353}>, <Database challenges for exploratory computing, {eid: 84939798327}>, <None, {eid: 74549184898}>, <Data cube: A relational aggregation operator generalizing group-by, cross-tab, and sub-totals, {eid: 21744433274}>, <None, {eid: 0003585297}>, <Interactive data exploration using semantic windows, {eid: 84904345576}>, <A session-based approach to fast-butapproximate interactive data cube exploration, {eid: 85042527551}>, <The six pillars for building big data analytics ecosystems, {eid: 84981489553}>, <None, {eid: 77952377529}>, <Servitization of business: Adding value by adding services, {eid: 1642608922}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,7/8/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85072763330

The H2020 HyProCell project targets the design and industrial integration of interconnected hybrid production cells in the subtractive and additive manufacturing with aspects of retrofitting of legacy production machines. This work describes and enhances architectural approaches to fit industrial requirements by proposing generic principles that support the automation engineering, cell control and basic data-acquisition.

These characteristics allow the manufacturer to monitor operation and control systems to improve performance through effective, efficient, and flexible production methods. Industry 4.0 continues to drive the manufacturing sector to use smart manufacturing systems to meet companies' challenges. For example, a smart welding system can be created by integrating a robot welding part of a manufacturing operation with smart manufacturing, which enlists all the necessary manufacturing assets. Such a smart welding system can improve the uptime and performance of the operation and control systems. Here, the Reference Architectural Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) is applied as a service-oriented architecture to demonstrate how to transform a robot welding system to meet the challenges of smart manufacturing in a structured way. This paper proposes using certain characteristics of I4.0 technologies for a smart welding system, based on a RAMI 4.0 conceptual approach, and designs a platform for a smart welding station.","Industry 4.0, Platform, RAMI 4.0, Smart Manufacturing System",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84984655115}>, <None, {eid: 85181385491}>, <Smart manufacturing, {eid: 85044560573}>, <None, {eid: 84968904605}>, <Industrie 4.0 - Technical Assets: Basic terminology concepts, life cycles and administration models, {eid: 85083530670}>, <Review on cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85010065711}>, <Dynamic shopfloor scheduling in multi-agent manufacturing systems, {eid: 33744827670}>, <None, {eid: 84979668295}>, <An architecture based on RAMI 4.0 to discover equipment to process operations required by products, {eid: 85040100373}>, <None, {eid: 84960947072}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,6/24/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85083534816

Putting the light on Europe, the key priorities for manufacturing are aligned with the Industry 4.0 strategy/program where the proliferation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and technologies like predictive data analytics, cloud and edge computing are creating the foundation for smart factory, i.e. the efficient and effective connection between products, processes and their related services. However, even if the smart factory vision is quite clear, in practice, it is still unclear how it can be implemented in a way to allow the transparent data exchange between all the layers of a manufacturing company, as well as, between the manufacturing company and the value chain partners. Within the German Industrie4.0 program, the Asset Administration Shell concept is defined to create a standardized digital representation of the asset while ensuring interoperability between all the applications within the manufacturing ecosystem. In this paper, an implementation of the asset administration shell is provided - also called NOVAAS - based on the deep usage of internet technologies, languages and software engineering techniques and methods (such as DevOps, microservices, continuous integration, etc.).

With the existing technologies in industrial solutions, the implementation of partly automated collaborative work of decentralized devices is difficult to achieve. Current industrial solutions fulfill manufacturer specific requirements that are not transferable to other industrial challenges. These customized solutions do not allow a plug-and-produce approach or a dynamically scalable system network. This work presents an approach for this through the use of a proposed service-based Industry 4.0 middleware. An example of its use is introduced in the form of the collaborative work of cranes, which handle the mentioned challenges. The proposed middleware is based on the service-oriented architecture with an evaluation of the I4.0 middleware using a demonstrator of collaborative work between cranes.","collaborative work of cranes, cyber physical systems, Industry 4.0, plug and produce, service-based middleware",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85021868159}>, <None, {eid: 85048841026}>, <None, {eid: 85048880582}>, <None, {eid: 84990068382}>, <Control strategies for crane systems: A comprehensive review, {eid: 85018762546}>, <Priority rules for twin automated stacking cranes that collaborate, {eid: 84947030174}>, <Collaborative agent-based system for multiple crane operations, {eid: 84863001349}>, <Prozessorchestrierung mittels modularer Softwareanwendungen auf intelligenten Feldgeräten, {eid: 85048898073}>, <None, {eid: 51749108900}>, <None, {eid: 85066602087}>, <Real-time operating systems book 2-the practice using stm cube, freertos and stm32 discovery board, {eid: 85066607796}>, <None, {eid: 85066615355}>, <Tracing real-time apllication interface using the linux trace toolkit, {eid: 85066618661}>, <None, {eid: 85066619085}>, <None, {eid: 85066631176}>, <None, {eid: 85066612943}>, <A real-time system using the preempt-rt patch and the rm, pip and edf scheduling policies, {eid: 85066601873}>, <An application of real-time operating system in high speed and high precision motion control systems, {eid: 44449165615}>, <An intelligent object manipulation framework for industrial tasks, {eid: 84887984987}>, <None, {eid: 85066633567}>, <None, {eid: 84905690111}>, <None, {eid: 85032291783}>, <Micro-computer control for a fuel cell test bench for residential use, {eid: 1542304729}>, <None, {eid: 85050697737}>, <Tornado and VxWorks-Whats not in the Manual, {eid: 85066636275}>, <None, {eid: 85099550642}>, <None, {eid: 84987948547}>, <None, {eid: 85066635487}>, <Time-sensitive networking standards, {eid: 85102341113}>, <None, {eid: 85105887306}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,3/2/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85066628982

Not only does the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency secure sustainability through increased energy efficiency but it also improves the efficiency in terms of overall productivity. Dyeing and finishing industries consume massive amounts of energy and have large energy-related expenditures. The industry comprises small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have insufficient capital to pay for the energy-efficient equipment. This study proposes a service-oriented platform that can achieve process and systematic efficiency enhancement based on the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The platform reflects the requirements of dyeing and finishing shops in the industry and secures effective interoperability and services using a service-oriented architectural design. A smart operation enabled by the service-oriented platform to improve the efficiency of traditional processes is developed. The system architecture, P4R data model, and service composition are discussed to understand the proposed process. Results suggest that it is possible to provide dyeing and finishing shops with services for reducing energy costs and improving productivity. The proposed platform also provides high-level services that utilize analytical techniques and data from the IIoT, and it serves as a suitable solution for small- and medium-sized enterprises by reducing costs.","Digital twin, dyeing and finishing shop, energy efficiency, industrial Internet of Things, service-oriented architecture, sustainable manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<C2ps: A Digital Twin

Data exchange standards are playing an increasingly important role to reduce risks associated with investments in these Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and adoptions of those emerging manufacturing paradigms. This paper looks back into the history of the standards for carrying the semantics of data across systems (or things), how they are developed, maintained, and represented, and then presents an insight into the current trends. In particular, the paper discusses the emerging move in data exchange standards practices toward model-based development and usage. We present functional requirements for a system supporting the model-based approach and conclude with implications and future directions.","History, Integration, Model-Based, Requirements, Semantics, Service-Oriented architecture, Smart manufacturing, Standards",,,,,,,,"<Reference architectures for smart manufacturing: a critical review, {eid: 85056448761}>, <Cloud manufacturing: strategic vision and state-of-the-art, {eid: 84888362486}>, <Standards landscape and directions for smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 84952791946}>, <On architecting and composing engineering information services to enable smart manufacturing, {eid: 84983514549}>, <RPC: remote procedure call protocol specification version 2, {eid: 85069871818}>, <The common object request broker: architecture and specification version 1.0, {eid: 0039018435}>, <Initial graphics exchange specification (IGES) version 4.0.

In the same manner, mechanical machines of the 1800s drove the industrial revolution, now digitalized machines are driving another industrial revolution. Manufacturers are increasing the digital footprint on the factory floor. It is challenging to harness the vast amounts of data generated, stored, analyzed, archived, and returned. Data centralization has several well-known challenges, such as collection bottlenecks, secure retrieval, single point of failure, and data scheme fragility as data heterogeneity increases. This paper proposes a method of information distribution based on the principle of data at its source. It proposes that contextual data be used at runtime through the creation of dynamic queries that build compositions of different systems. Such system of systems (SoS) compositions handle the flow of data across its life cycle and present it as information to the initiating system. The proposal starts by creating a graph model of the Arrowhead framework. Then, building on the graph model, the query-based approach for specifying, validating, and forming the SoS is proposed. The proposed graph model allows for unambiguous description of systems and their interrelations, including security relations. The proposed composer operates on the edge computing hardware and gives the production floor the ability to extract information without impacting the overall operation of the factory.","Arrowhead framework (AF), edge computing, graph theory, Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), information centric networking, RAMI4.0, RESTful, service-oriented architecture, system of systems (SoS), systems theory",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 79958776761}>, <None, {eid: 85071443114}>, <None, {eid: 85075745088}>, <Agile software development, the people factor, {eid: 0035500136}>, <None, {eid: 85075748327}>, <None, {eid: 85075725060}>, <IoT mashups with the WoTKit, {eid: 84873557511}>, <None, {eid: 85063999646}>, <None, {eid: 85048465072}>, <None, {eid: 85075763892}>, <The arrowhead approach for SOA application development and documentation, {eid: 84949513541}>, <None, {eid: 0003520264}>, <TinyDB: An acquisitional query processing system for sensor networks, {eid: 23944487783}>, <None, {eid: 85046676810}>, <A survey of information-centric networking research, {eid: 84901242669}>, <Service-centric networking, {eid: 80051967471}>, <Service composition adaptation: An overview, {eid: 84874571862}>, <A petri net-based method for compatibility analysis and composition of web services in business process execution language, {eid: 58149495956}>, <Adaptation of web service interactions using complex event processing patterns, {eid: 82055196711}>, <Conditional importance networks: A graphical language for representing ordinal, monotonic preferences over sets of goods, {eid: 78751691701}>, <None, {eid: 85075719364}>, <In-network processing for context-aware SOA-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 85046654831}>, <None, {eid: 77954597116}>, <None, {eid: 84881399578}>, <Reusable interface definitions for constrained restful environments, {eid: 85056635511}>, <IoT interoperability-On-demand and low latency transparent multi-protocol translator, {eid: 85037051630}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,12/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85075753917

However, traditional automation and control systems are designed as static silos, which are generally configured once for a specific purpose. Hence, these systems lack the flexibility to efficiently adjust to dynamically changing system requirements, which includes the integration of heterogeneous devices and services on-request, or elastic features such as on-demand provisioning of computing and storage resources. In this work, we propose a reference architecture for implementing a cyber-physical infrastructure as-a-service (CPIaaS) framework. This framework is based on the concept of service-oriented virtualization and provides a level of flexibility and interoperability to CPS, that cannot be matched using traditional approaches for building highly integrated, cross-platform, inter-domain communication environments.","Automation, Control, CPS, Cyber-physical system, Digital twin, IaaS, Industry 4.0, Infrastructure as-a-service, Service-oriented architecture, SoA",,,,,,,,"<Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing, {eid: 12344308304}>, <None, {eid: 84966658958}>, <Software engineering for self-adaptive systems: A second research roadmap, {eid: 84879852118}>, <A survey on service-oriented network virtu-alization toward convergence of networking and cloud computing, {eid: 84871003529}>, <Everything as a service (XaaS) on the cloud: Origins, current and future trends.

In this context, the Osmotic Computing paradigm, theorized in 2016 as integration between a centralized Cloud layer and Edge and/or IoT layers, has further emphasized the Industry 4.0 objectives including productivity and Quality of Services (QoS). This emerging paradigm proposes a new elastic management model of microservices, where deployment and migration strategies are strongly related to the underlaying infrastructure requirements (i.e., load balancing, reliability, availability, and so on) and applications (i.e., anomalies detection, awareness of the context, proximity, QoS, and so on). Specifically, knowing that an Osmotic application must have a failover behavior (highly horizontally/vertically scalable, 24 hours 24 available, fault-tolerant and secure), this paper highlights the Osmotic ecosystem platform focusing on the implementation of a blue-green mechanism for the fast re-deployment of microservices, exploiting emerging technologies, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Agento and MongoDB. Experiments shows the time required to arrange, deploy and destroy microservices.","Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, IoT, Microservice., Orchestration, Osmotic Computing",,,,,,,,"<An approach for the secure management of hybrid cloudedge environments, {eid: 85050693613}>, <Edge computing in iot-based manufacturing, {eid: 85053451057}>, <A hybrid computing solution and resource scheduling strategy for edge computing in smart manufacturing, {eid: 85063689140}>, <Intelligent equipment design assisted by cognitive internet of things and industrial big data, {eid: 85083908466}>, <How to conceive future mobility services in smart cities according to the fiware frontiercities experience, {eid: 85055665791}>, <Osmotic computing: A new paradigm for edge/cloud integration, {eid: 85009108053}>, <None, {eid: 85078885834}>, <None, {eid: 85078885552}>, <Towards osmotic computing: Looking at basic principles and technologies, {eid: 85026326022}>, <None, {eid: 85034108245}>, <Computational offloading for efficient trust management in pervasive online social networks using osmotic computing, {eid: 85021842143}>, <None, {eid: 85019186519}>, <Reputation-based web service orchestration in cloud computing: A survey, {eid: 84929898066}>, <A note on resource orchestration for cloud computing, {eid: 84929913568}>, <None, {eid: 84949923258}>, <On multi-access edge computing: A survey of the emerging 5g network edge cloud architecture and orchestration, {eid: 85029488167}>, <None, {eid: 85027255273}>, <None, {eid: 84988836289}>, <A platform of scientific workflows for orchestration of parallel components in a cloud of high performance computing applications, {eid: 84989315863}>, <None, {eid: 84979543922}>, <None, {eid: 77954931133}>, <Echo: An adaptive orchestration platform for hybrid dataflows across cloud and edge, {eid: 85034088330}>, <None, {eid: 85011048660}>, <None, {eid: 85032866807}>, <A study on container virtualization for guarantee quality of service in cloud-of-things, {eid: 85065122940}>, <Distributed analytics in fog computing platforms using tensorflow and kubernetes, {eid: 85040552444}>, <Modelling performance & resource management in kubernetes, {eid: 85009084303}>, <None, {eid: 85078943135}>, <None, {eid: 85078874116}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/29/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85078938701

Intelligent manufacturing, as a core of Industry 4.0, represents a deep integration of new IT technologies, such as the industrial Internet of Things and service-oriented architecture, and manufacturing process. To realize intelligent manufacturing, this article introduces a cloud-assisted and edge-decision-making manufacturing architecture that contains a cloud and production edges. An intelligent production edge is designed to provide the traditional devices the abilities of data access and self-decision making. Besides, the proposed architecture is modeled as a multiagent system with the edge intelligence support, describing the agent-based reconfiguration mechanism from the three aspects, namely, agent interaction, agent behavior, and negotiation mechanism. The experimental results show that the reconfigurable method based on the proposed architecture can be used in the mixed-flow production scenario based on random orders, to improve the adaptability and robustness.","Edge computing, intelligent manufacturing, multiagent system (MAS)",,,,,,,,"<Edge computing in IoT-based manufacturing, {eid: 85053451057}>, <Renewable energy-Aware big data analytics in geo-distributed data centers with reinforcement learning, {eid: 85043380000, doi: 10.1109/TNSE.2018.2813333}>, <Scalability in manufacturing systems design and operation: State-of-The-Art and future developments roadmap, {eid: 84883246731}>, <Flexible manufacturing system selection using preference ranking methods: A comparative study, {eid: 84894138591}>, <Design of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, {eid: 79953281016}>, <Flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing systems paradigms, {eid: 33750016925}>, <Performance analysis of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), {eid: 85028641623, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2017.03.123}>, <Reconfiguration point decision method based on dynamic complexity for reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS), {eid: 85014640207}>, <An autonomous manufacturing system based on swarm of cognitive agents, {eid: 84865228099}>, <Matrix structures for high volumes and flexibility in production systems, {eid: 84904470248, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.040}>, <Agile manufacturing practices for new product development: Industrial case studies, {eid: 84971265275}>, <Erlang-based control implementation for a holonic manufacturing cell, {eid: 84976299612}>, <CPROSA-holarchy: An enhanced PROSA model to enable worker-Cobot agile manufacturing, {eid: 85045201524}>, <None, {eid: 85006193516}>, <A big data enabled load-balancing control for smart manufacturing of industry 4.0, {eid: 85017518536}>, <Design of reconfiguration mechanism for holonic manufacturing systems based on formal models, {eid: 77957879698}>, <Cloud-based smart manufacturing for personalized candy packing application, {eid: 84988422263}>, <ADACOR: A holonic architecture for agile and adaptive manufacturing control, {eid: 30544441225}>, <Fog computing for energy-Aware load balancing and scheduling in smart factory, {eid: 85044350923}>, <A hybrid computing solution and resource scheduling strategy for edge computing in smart manufacturing, {eid: 85063689140}>, <Traffic and computation co-offloading with reinforcement learning in fog computing for industrial applications, {eid: 85057892451}>, <Improving cognitive ability of edge intelligent IIoT through machine learning, {eid: 85073325061}>, <Making big data open in edges: A resource-efficient blockchain-based approach, {eid: 85053613865}>, <CASOA: An architecture for agent-based manufacturing system in the context of Industry 4.0, {eid: 85030752081}>, <A multi-Agent system for sharing distributed manufacturing resources, {eid: 85041480290}>, <Analysis of multi-Agent activity using Petri nets, {eid: 74449092288}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85084926323

Published by Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.In the context of Industry 4.0, an emerging trend is to increase the reliability of industrial process by using machine learning (ML) to detect anomalies of production machines. The main advantages of ML are in the ability to (1) capture non-linear phenomena, (2) adapt to many different processes without human intervention and (3) learn incrementally and improve over time. In this paper, we take the perspective of IT system architects and analyse the implications of the inclusion of ML components into a traditional anomaly detection systems. Through a prototype that we deployed for chemical reactors, our findings are that such ML components are impacting drastically the architecture of classical alarm systems. First, there is a need for long-term storage of the data that are used to train the models. Second, the training and usage of ML models can be CPU intensive and may request using specific resources. Third, there is no single algorithm that can detect machine errors. Fourth, human crafted alarm rules can now also include a learning process to improve these rules, for example by using active learning with a human-in-the-loop approach. These reasons are the motivations behind a microservice-based architecture for an alarm system in industrial machinery.","Anomaly Detection, Industry 4.0, Monitoring, Rule Engine, System Architecture",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4.0 -Technological approaches, use cases, implementation, {eid: 84946746011, doi: 10.1515/auto-2015-0025}>, <None, {eid: 85071113982}>, <Anomaly detection, {eid: 68049121093}>, <A data-driven approach to predict NOx-emissions of gas turbines, {eid: 85047853289, doi: 10.1109/BigData.2017.8258056}>, <Anomaly detection in cyber physical systems using recurrent neural networks, {eid: 85019260937, doi: 10.1109/HASE.2017.36}>, <Toward supervised anomaly detection, {eid: 84875512265, doi: 10.1613/jair.3623,arXiv:1401.6424}>, <None, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Enabling community health care with microservices, {eid: 85048355382, doi: 10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00220}>, <Machine learning for predictive maintenance of industrial machines using IoT sensor data, {eid: 85047001673, doi: 10.1109/ICSESS.2017.8342870}>, <None, {eid: 85085561640}>, <Designing a smart city internet of things platform with microservice architecture, {eid: 84959050879, doi: 10.1109/FiCloud.2015.55}>, <Cassandra: A decentralized structured storage system, {eid: 77955933052}>, <Big data: Dimensions, evolution, impacts, challenges, {eid: 85012284270}>, <OPC UA Service-oriented Architecture for Industrial Applications, {eid: 79960024539}>, <Bbdata, a big data platform for smart buildings, {eid: 85085573805}>, <Big Building Data-a Big Data Platform for Smart Buildings, {eid: 85029904612}>, <Machine learning for internet of things data analysis: A survey, {eid: 85049099526}>, <None, {eid: 85031676638}>, <Anomaly detection based on sensor data in petroleum industry applications, {eid: 84921904704, doi: 10.3390/s150202774}>, <Weather data analysis and sensor fault detection using an extended IoT framework with semantics, big data, machine learning, {eid: 85047833066, doi: 10.1109/BigData.2017.8258150}>, <Machine learning for anomaly detection in time-series produced by industrial processes, {eid: 85085548506}>, <Microservice-based iot for smart buildings, {eid: 85021424248, doi: 10.1109/WAINA.2017.77}>, <Big-data-driven anomaly detection in industry (4.0): An approach and a case study, {eid: 85015218171, doi: 10.1109/BigData.2016.7840777}>, <Processes, Motivations, Issues for Migrating to Microservices Architectures: An Empirical Investigation, {eid: 85038613047, doi: 10.1109/MCC.2017.4250931}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: An IoT-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602, doi: 10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387665}>, <Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing, {eid: 85040175609, doi: 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2005.00662.x}>, <Spark: Cluster computing with working sets, {eid: 85085251984}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,4/6/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85085557038

The adoption of this concept is related to a high number of challenges and risks. A possible solution to address these challenges and risks is the adoption or implementation of this concept using the maturity models. The maturity models use various approaches to Industry 4.0 with concepts and procedures varying in every maturity model. However, there still exist divergences in terms of their impact on the organizational units. This research conducts the comparative analysis of significant maturity models to identify generally shared traits of Industry 4.0 that are common to the majority of the analyzed maturity models.

The service-oriented architecture is an approach in the context of I4.0, which can be used to implement the decentralized task distribution. The high agility and changing customer requirements associated with I4.0 pose a major challenge to the previous phase-oriented development process of industry plants. Furthermore, the existing development process can only deal with static industry architecture, in the form of implemented functionality. In this paper, we propose a model driven development process of a service-oriented I4.0 system, which helps to deal with the above mentioned challenges. We extended and implemented a detailed I4.0 service metamodel based on the reference model of service architecture (RM-SA) for I4.0 to model the service-oriented architecture. The resulted model can be connected with the system model and later used for code generation. The proposed approach helps to increase the reusability of service and system design and accelerates the reconfiguration process in case of changing customer requirement. Our result show that an industry 4.0 system can be described in a service-oriented way with the help of a service metamodel and a faster deployment can be achieved with model based tool support.","industry 4.0, model-driven development, service modeling, service-oriented systems, system modeling",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4.0: Ein praxisorientierter Ansatz"", {eid: 85020591285}>, <Design principles for industrie 4.0 scenarios, {eid: 84975454820}>, <Model-based planning and configuration of distributed functions in the field"", {eid: 85084949557}>, <VDI/VDE,Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0), {eid: 85084950477}>, <An AutomationML/OPC UA-based Industry 4.0 solution for a manufacturing system, {eid: 85057287351}>, <Service-Based industry 4.0 middleware for partly automated collaborative work of cranes, {eid: 85066628982}>, <Reference model of Industrie 4.0 service architectures"", {eid: 84946746922}>, <Why or why not service oriented architecture, {eid: 70350561722}>, <Service oriented Architecture and Cloud Manufacturing, {eid: 85011105399}>, <Model-based development tool for the design and analysis of secure industry 4.0 systems, {eid: 85084959032}>, <Scenario-Based Development of an Industry 4.0 Domain Description Language for a Plant Architecture, {eid: 85050564814}>, <Model-Driven design of tools for multi-domain systems with loosely coupled metamodels, {eid: 85073150955}>, <Interdisziplin are modellbasierte Entwicklung mechatronischer Systeme basierend auf SysML zur Steigerung der Wiederverwendung"", {eid: 85006478690}>, <None, {eid: 84867643299}>, <None, {eid: 85084959957}>, <Linking intrusion detection system information and system model to redesign security architecture, {eid: 85084949998}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2/11/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85084951783

Utilizing the microservice approach, tests were performed with devices communicating through the Zigbee, Bluetooth LE, and Wi-fi protocols. The results were compared with tests using the same protocols in isolation. It was possible to perceive a low percentage of timeouts and invalid packages. In some cases, the use of multiple protocols had presented a lower performance compared with the isolated experiments, using Omniconn in a testbed environment was considered feasible.

Simulations are frequently used to increase this type of efficiency through diagnosis and evaluation of a physical asset. In particular, digital twin (DT) is currently attracting considerable attention as it provides technical functionality at the type and instance stages of a work center. In addition, DT can support efficient control and decision making with less gap in the site through vertical integration and horizontal coordination. Moreover, DT can contribute to prevent energy-related inefficiency by providing the functionalities required for the service composition of the technical functionalities that are defined for the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency. However, in terms of the provision of service-composition-based technical functionality of DT, no research has defined each step of the operation procedures of work-center-level DT application at a detailed level. This study proposes detailed operation procedures to create, synchronize, and utilize a work-center-level DT to provide appropriate service-composition-based technical functionality. To this end, the technical requirements were derived from the analysis of the service-composition-based technical functionality. This study systematically defined the various service-composition-based technical functionalities through a combination of various types of operation procedures. Each type is defined for three steps, namely creation, synchronization, and utilization. In addition, a case study was conducted to clarify DT and provide a suitable definition for the requirements.","Asset administration shell, Digital twin, Process and systematic efficiency enhancement,

The cooperation and coordination of smart things are a promising strategy for satisfying requirements that are beyond the capacity of a single smart thing. One of the major challenges for today's software engineering is the management of large and complex computing systems characterized by a high degree of physical distribution. Examples of such systems arise in many application domains. The number of connected devices grows from billions to hundreds of billions, so a maximum of automatisms must be integrated in IoT architectures in order to control and manage them. Software architects migrate to service oriented architecture and applications are now being constructed as service compositions. Since each IoT device includes one or more microservices, the increasing number of devices around the user makes them difficult to assemble in order to achieve a common goal. In this paper, we propose a self-assembling solution based on self-controlled service components taking into account non-functional requirements concerning the offered quality of services and the structuration of the resulting assembly. Its aim is to build and maintain an assembly of services (taking into account arrival of new peers or failure of existing ones) that, besides functional requirements, also fulfills global quality-of-service and structural requirements.","Internet of Things, Quality of service, Self-assembly, Service component, Service composition, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<User-assisted semantic interoperability in Internet of Things: visuallyfacilitated ontology alignment through visually-enriched ontology and thing descriptions, {eid: 84881423990}>, <IBM cloud, {eid: 85084938014}>, <Amazon web services, {eid: 85081548120}>, <Microsoft azure, {eid: 85081561000}>, <Adaptive video transmission control system based on reinforcement learning approach over heterogeneous networks, {eid: 85027958784, doi: 10.1109/TASE.2014.2387212}>, <Energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation for delay-constrained video over heterogeneous wireless networks, {eid: 85009971384, doi: 10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632599}>, <Constructing distributed time-critical applications using cognitive enabled services, {eid: 85065664842, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.010}>, <SWITCH workbench: A novel approach for the development and deployment of time-critical microservice-based cloud-native applications, {eid: 85064939462, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.008}>, <An overview of cloud middleware services for interconnection of healthcare platforms, {eid: 84907342232, doi: 10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866753}>, <None, {eid: 85084940100}>, <Autonomic Computing: Principles, Design and Implementation, {eid: 84890106421}>, <Internet of smart things -

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have affected several research fields, leading to improvements that could not have been possible with conventional optimization techniques. Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human–machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.","Anomaly detection, Fault detection, Human-Machine interaction, Industry 4.0, Machine learning, Predictive

Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Indiana University of Pennsylvania>, <Department of Information Systems, Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>, <Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>",,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.","Information systems, Service-Oriented Architecture, SOA, Success factors, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<An exploratory study for investigating the issues and current practices of service-oriented architecture adoption, {eid: 85068423836, doi: 10.32890/jict2019.18.3.3}>, <A research on SOA in the IT industry of Pakistan, {eid: 85066803017, doi: 10.1145/3323933.3324080}>, <State of the practice in service identification for SOA migration in industry, {eid: 85056896158, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_46}>, <Energy-aware services composition for Internet of Things, {eid: 85050466884, doi: 10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355213}>, <Event-driven SOA-based iot architecture, {eid: 85040241178, doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-5520-1_24}>, <SOAP-based web service for localization of multi-robot system in cloud, {eid: 85057109748, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-01177-2_29}>, <Cloud computing as a facilitator for web service composition in factory automation, {eid: 84994218554, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1277-z}>, <A case-based reasoning approach to reuse quality-driven designs in service-oriented architectures, {eid: 85049518388, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2018.06.003}>, <Service-oriented architecture: myths, realities, and a maturity model, {eid: 79951897344}>, <Critical factors in the effective of service-oriented architecture, {eid: 84902963791}>, <A proposition of critical success factors influencing SOA implementation in healthcare, {eid: 84905748849}>, <Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and Technology, {eid: 34548309673}>, <Web services architecture w3c working group note 11, {eid: 0142074003}>, <Service-oriented architecture scenario, {eid: 33646928571, doi: 10.2111/REM-D-09-00117.1}>, <Defining SOA as an architectural style: Align your business model with technology, {eid: 41949090570}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture Compass: Business Value, Planning, and Enterprise Roadmap, {eid: 29744464022}>, <Enterprise SOA: Service-oriented architecture best practices, {eid: 33744509965}>, <Service-oriented architecture unlocking hidden value in insurance systems, {eid: 85078544363}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, {eid: 4644300495}>, <SOA: Principles of Service Design, Vol. 1, {eid: 35549003927}>, <Enterprise Service Oriented Architectures: Concepts, Challenges, Recommendations, {eid: 38549091817}>, <Reference model for service oriented architecture 1.0.

Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.","Attack Patterns, CVSS, Cybersecurity pillars, IIoT, Industrial Internet of Things, Industrial Security, Information Technologies, Operational Technologies, Risk

In this tutorial, we explain the fundamental elements of blockchains. We discuss their ability to achieve availability, consistency, and data integrity as well as their inherent limitations. Using Ethereum as a case study, we describe the inner workings of blockchains in detail before comparing blockchains to traditional distributed systems. In the second part of our tutorial, we discuss the major challenges facing blockchains and summarize ongoing research and commercial offerings that seek to address these challenges.","Blockchain,

107,,,,A comparison of fog and cloud computing cyberphysical interfaces for Industry 4.0 real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations. However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the clouds highly scalable processing capacity, the fogs decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85065718296
