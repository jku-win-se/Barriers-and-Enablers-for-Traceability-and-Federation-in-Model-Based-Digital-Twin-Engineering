All right reserved.As an enabling technology for implementing smart manufacturing, industrial 4.0, industrial internet and smart city, digital twin has received great attention from both academics and industry, especially its industrial applications. Model is the foundation and core of digital twin theories and technologies, but the traditional three-dimension digital twin model can no longer meet the new application requirements and technology development trends. To promote the application of digital twin in more fields, a five-dimension digital twin model was put forward in authors' previous research to digital twin shop-floor. In view of the new demands on digital twin and based on the previous research, a more systematic five-dimension digital twin model was presented. Furthermore, its applications in ten fields were discussed, including satellite/space communication network, ships, vehicles, power plant, aircraft, complex equipment, stereoscopic warehouse, medical, shop-floor and smart city, which could provide theoretical and methodological references for the application of digital twin in the future.","Applications, Digital twin, Five-dimension digital twin model, Ten fields",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85126961301}>, <Digital twin workshop: a new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: a new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152}>, <Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <Digital twin and its potential application exploration, {eid: 85046337978}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85042921933, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2018.1443229}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <Digital twin and big data towards smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: 360 degree comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <IIHub: An Industrial Internet-Of-Things Hub towards Smart Manufacturing Based on Cyber-Physical system, {eid: 85030779624}>, <Equipment energy consumption management in digital twin shop-floor: a framework and potential applications, {eid: 85048222217}>, <Data-driven smart manufacturing, {eid: 85040599054}>, <Connotation, architecture and trends of product digital twin, {eid: 85021844855}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex system, {eid: 85016450943}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.

The data accumulated during system operation can provide information for further state evaluation and fault diagnosis to ensure safe and stable operation of power system. However, these data are uncertain and the evaluation is based on experience, which makes the state evaluation of transformer still a challenge. At present, digital twin, which could represent the features of any objects or subjects, has received widely attentions from various regions, while its application in power system is still limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a transformer state evaluation approach based on the digital twin. This approach establishes a digital twin model of power transformer, and acquires the sample data and labels from the simulation process and state evaluation under various condition. These sample data and labels will guide the decision making of state evaluation in the real situation. This paper compares the sample data and labels from the digital twin model with those from the physical system, so that the performance of digital twin model and real system would be promoted during this mutual amendment progress.","D-S Evidence Theory, Digital Twin Model, Power Transformer, State Evaluation, Subjective and Objective Comprehensive Empowerment",,,,,,,,"<Challenges and prospects of fault prognostic and health management for power transformer, {eid: 85040570387}>, <Integration of macro energy thinking and big data thinking part one big data and power big data, {eid: 84966644200}>, <Study on the technology of the on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis for transformer insulation using the character value of oil-dissolved gases, {eid: 85080382354}>, <Aging condition assessment of oil-paper based on principal component and factor analysis of partial discharge, {eid: 33748692745}>, <Application of infrared thermal imaging technology to condition-based maintenance of power equipment, {eid: 84873944164}>, <Furan analysis for liquid power transformers, {eid: 84858166582}>, <Operational condition assessment of in-service distribution transformers, {eid: 85080432538}>, <Transformer winding hot-spot temperature prediction model of support vector machine optimized by genetic algorithm, {eid: 84897688632}>, <Predictive diagnosis of high-power transformer faults by networking vibration measuring nodes with integrated signal processing, {eid: 85006091228}>, <Transformer condition assessment based on support vector machine and dga, {eid: 77954734390}>, <Running state and its risk evaluation of transmission line based on markov chain model, {eid: 84938095789}>, <Condition assessment model for power transformer in service based on fuzzy synthetic evaluation, {eid: 40749122511}>, <Evaluation of security state in grounding grid based on DT method and rough set, {eid: 85017629996}>, <Application of artificial neural network and information fusion technology in power transformer condition assessment, {eid: 84898686125}>, <Condition evaluation of transformer based on combined weight and d-s evidence theory, {eid: 84943422167}>, <Research status of condition assessment method for power equipment, {eid: 85061970555}>, <Optimized throughput improvement of assembly flow line with digital twin online analytics, {eid: 85049873745}>, <Digital twin for energy optimization in an SMT-PCB assembly line, {eid: 85061704099}>, <Interactive analysis and visualization of digital twins in high-dimensional state spaces, {eid: 85060820360}>, <A digital twin method for automated behavior analysis of large-scale distributed iot systems, {eid: 85069795719}>, <A digital twin architecture based on the industrial internet of things technologies, {eid: 85063782240}>, <Experimentable digital twins for a modeling and simulation-based engineering approach, {eid: 85059987023}>, <A digital twin for cyber-physical energy systems, {eid: 85068844872}>, <Time-varying transformer outage model for operational risk assessment, Part one: Condition based failure rate estimation method for transformer internal latent fault estimation, {eid: 77956003048}>, <Study on fault diagnose method of transformer DGA with fuzzy model hiberarchy classification, {eid: 0035243909}>, <Analysis of key electrical test indexes in power transformer state evaluation, {eid: 85080369832}>, <Evaluation and analysis of weighting method in multi-index comprehensive evaluation, {eid: 84901652750}>, <An optimal combination weighting method that synthesizes subjective and objective weight information, {eid: 70350475320}>, <Data fusion algorithm based on DS evidential theory and its application for circuit fault diagnosis, {eid: 0036485992}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/6/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85078834715

This paper presents the design methodology, mathematical analysis, simulation study, and experimental validation of a digital twin approach for fault diagnosis. We develop a digital twin that estimates the measurable characteristic outputs of a PV energy conversion unit (PVECU) in real time. The PVECU constitutes a PV source and a source-level power converter. The fault diagnosis is performed by generating and evaluating an error residual vector, which is the difference between the estimated and measured outputs. A PV panel-level power converter prototype is built to demonstrate how the sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities of the converter can enable effective fault diagnosis in real time. The experimental results show detection and identification of ten different faults in the PVECU. The time to fault detection (FD) in the power converter and the electrical sensors is less than 290 μs and the identification time is less than 4 ms. The time to FD and identification in the PV panel are less than 80 ms and 1.2 s, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates higher fault sensitivity than that of existing approaches. It can diagnose a 20% drift in the electrical sensor gains and a 20% shading of a solar cell in the PV panel.","Converters, estimation, fault diagnosis, fault location, solar power generation",,,,,,,,"<Fault diagnosis via PV panel-integrated power electronics, {eid: 84988942953}>, <Cascaded DC-DC converter connection of photovoltaic modules, {eid: 3843069865}>, <Improved energy capture in series string photovoltaics via smart distributed power electronics, {eid: 65949099327}>, <building america case study: Photovoltaic systems with modulelevel power electronics. technology solutions for new and existing homes, energy efficiency &renewable energy (EERE), {eid: 85074191405}>, <None, {eid: 85074198863}>, <Differential power processing for increased energy production and reliability of photovoltaic systems, {eid: 84882935460}>, <Impact of distributed power electronics on the lifetime and reliability of PV systems, {eid: 85018665385}>, <Classification and comparative evaluation of PV panel-integrated DC-DC converter concepts, {eid: 84893073315}>, <Fault impacts on solar power unit reliability, {eid: 79955783982}>, <Failure modes and effect analysis of module level power electronics, {eid: 84961653984}>, <Assessment of photovoltaic module failures in the field, {eid: 85047081933}>, <None, {eid: 0003781221}>, <Fault-tolerant strategy for a photovoltaic DC-DC converter, {eid: 84880910882}>, <Photovoltaic systems reliability improvement by real-time FPGA-based switch failure diagnosis and faulttolerant DC-DC converter, {eid: 84943769930}>, <Model-based fault detection and identification for switching power converters, {eid: 84999233018}>, <Photovoltaic hot-spot detection for solar panel substrings using ac parameter characterization, {eid: 84944096315}>, <Automatic fault diagnosis in PV systems with distributed MPPT, {eid: 84884888322}>, <Fault diagnosis of photovoltaic panels using dynamic current-voltage characteristics, {eid: 84988241284}>, <PV faults: Overview, modeling, prevention, and detection techniques, {eid: 85074203240}>, <Performance and degradation analysis for long term reliability of solar photovoltaic systems: A review, {eid: 84882260617}>, <Toward reliable power electronics: Challenges, design tools, and opportunities, {eid: 84879957467}>, <Transitioning to physics-of-failure as a reliability driver in power electronics, {eid: 84930246599}>, <Condition monitoring for device reliability in power electronic converters:Areview, {eid: 79952599891}>, <None, {eid: 85074207263}>, <None, {eid: 85074191099}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <High efficiency wide load range buck/boost/bridge photovoltaic microconverter, {eid: 79955755269}>, <None, {eid: 0004107121}>, <Comprehensive approach to modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays, {eid: 67349141404}>, <Modelling power output in photovoltaic modules for outdoor operating conditions, {eid: 33646437532}>, <Potential-induced degradation in photovoltaic modules: A critical review, {eid: 85009975869}>, <FPGA-based real-time power converter failure diagnosis for wind energy conversion systems, {eid: 57749193475}>, <State observer-based sensor fault detection and isolation, and fault tolerant control of a singlephase PWM rectifier for electric railway traction, {eid: 84879110850}>, <Fault diagnosis of PWM DC-DC converters based on magnetic component voltages equation, {eid: 84900421175}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,1/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85074215768

With the increasing complexity of the power grid, the state estimation is more needed to maintain the stability of operation. The availability of digital twin model can assist in estimating the status of the power grid. Based on the measured data from the phasor measurement unit (PMU), the DT can monitor the power grid condition. Additionally, it can estimate the possible states in the power grid with the future event. In this paper, the state estimation of the inverter dominated grid by DT model is formulated. To build the DT model, the neural network (NN) is utilized to emulate the dynamic feature of the inverter. The training data of NN in DT is obtained from the reference model. The reference model is created based on traditional dynamic state equations of inverter and power grid. To validate the accuracy of DT model, the simulation results of the reference model are firstly compared with the results of the DT model after the training process. Afterwards, two additional scenarios are simulated initially by DT based on the Cigré benchmark grid to validate the accuracy of state estimation in the power grid. The results illustrate that the state estimation by DT has high similarity degree with the reference model.","Digital twin, neural network, state estimation",,,,,,,,"<Long-term global warming scenarios computed with an efficient coupled climate model, climatic change ausgabe 2, {eid: 0032821316}>, <A digital twin for the production planning based on cyber-physiscal systems, {eid: 85057272855}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <None, {eid: 84957886602}>, <A case study for a digital twin of body-in-white production systems general concept for automated updating of planning projects in the digital factory"" in, {eid: 85057237609}>, <Parameter tuning for dynamic digital twins in inverter-dominated distribution grid, {eid: 85083448511, doi: 10.1049/iet-rpg.2019.0163}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943, doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.26367.61609}>, <None, {eid: 0004133171}>, <None, {eid: 0642363227}>, <None, {eid: 0003413187}>, <A novel radial basis function neural network based intelligent adaptive architecture for power system stabilizer, {eid: 77954794496}>, <None, {eid: 85075856908}>, <None, {eid: 0003444646}>, <None, {eid: 85095602040}>, <Rodic industry 4 0 and the new simulation modelling paradigm, {eid: 85028767217}>, <Automatically identifying and predicting unplanned wind turbine stoppages using scada and alarms system data: Case study and results, {eid: 85037979909}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the.

First, preprocessing and visualization operation are performed on the original error data. Then, the data fitting and short-term prediction of electronic transformer error are made on the basis of the backpropagation neural network and the Prophet model, and the fitting and prediction results of the two methods are compared and analysed in combination with four evaluation indexes.

This work proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset–twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The formal definition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems and control theory. The declarative and general nature of the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision-making is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight damage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data. The graphical model foundation ensures that the digital twin calibration and updating process is principled, unified and able to scale to an entire fleet of digital twins.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85125284750}>, <Digital twin: values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <Reengineering aircraft structural life prediction using a digital twin, {eid: 84855216556, doi: 10.1155/2011/154798}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US air force vehicles, {eid: 85125249451}>, <Dynamic Bayesian network for aircraft wing health monitoring digital twin, {eid: 85014566387, doi: 10.2514/1.J055201}>, <Digital twin for operations—present applications and future digital thread, {eid: 85086229898}>, <Digital twins in health care: ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524, doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00031}>, <Towards continuous monitoring in personalized healthcare through digital twins, {eid: 85081157740}>, <Human digital twin for fitness management, {eid: 85081154665, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971576}>, <Towards AI-powered personalization in MOOC learning, {eid: 85105745635, doi: 10.1038/s41539-017-0016-3}>, <Smart city digital twins, {eid: 85046124603}>, <Dynamic data driven applications systems: A new paradigm for application simulations and measurements, {eid: 35048873249}>, <None, {eid: 85125237279}>, <None, {eid: 85125263620}>, <None, {eid: 85125233389}>, <Data-driven physics-based digital twins via a library of component-based reduced-order models, {eid: 85087210398}>, <None, {eid: 85132470588}>, <A Bayesian state-space approach for damage detection and classification, {eid: 85019084733, doi: 10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.03.043}>, <Learning about physical parameters: the importance of model discrepancy, {eid: 84908582437, doi: 10.1088/0266-5611/30/11/114007}>, <None, {eid: 85053527918}>, <A hardware testbed for dynamic data-driven aerospace digital twins, {eid: 85097431033}>, <Integrated simulation model for preliminary aerodynamic, structural and control-law design of aircraft, {eid: 0032659848}>, <None, {eid: 0004070667}>, <None, {eid: 77957352104}>, <A survey of point-based POMDP solvers, {eid: 84873747053, doi: 10.1007/s10458-012-9200-2}>, <None, {eid: 84899438881}>, <A Bayesian approach for learning and planning in partially observable Markov decision processes, {eid: 79960110381}>, <Active learning in partially observable Markov decision processes, {eid: 33646410076}>, <None, {eid: 85125277556}>, <None, {eid: 85106412888}>, <None, {eid: 85106416780}>",,,Springer Nature,,,5/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85115144191

Eng.Driven by energy transition and technological progress, power system industry is undergoing a rapid development with an important trend or key feature, i. e., high penetration of renewable energy plus high penetration of power electronic equipment (namely, ""double high""), which, however, brings significant changes to the dynamic behavior of the system and causes new issues of stability. In this paper, the new features of ""double high"" power systems were summarized first. Next, their impacts on the various aspects of classical power system stability were briefly reviewed. Then, we surveyed the emerging stability issues in the context of ""double high"". After an examination of applicability of the classical and extended classification of power system stability by IEEE/Cigre, a new classification framework was finally proposed to get with the new scenario of ""double high"", while maintaining the classical logic of classification. Hopefully, this work helps to promote the researches on modeling, analysis and control of the stability of ""double high"" power systems.","Classification, Power electronics, Power system stability, Renewable energy",,,,,,,,"<Impact of high penetration of renewable resources on power system transient stability, {eid: 85079031059}>, <Renewables 2020 global status report, {eid: 85090503548}>, <World wind power generation development in 2000, {eid: 85101081781}>, <None, {eid: 85101060872}>, <None, {eid: 85101103468}>, <None, {eid: 85101169124}>, <None, {eid: 85101154220}>, <Multi-time scale voltage and power angle dynamics in power electronics dominated large power systems, {eid: 84991740196}>, <Power electronics, smart grid, and renewable energy systemsJ, {eid: 85030787585}>, <Multi-time scale transients in power-electronized power systems considering multi-time scale switching control schemes of power electronics apparatus, {eid: 85074891621}>, <Global wind energy outlook 2016, {eid: 79951517694}>, <Technology roadmap-solar photovoltaic energy, 2014, {eid: 78751509103}>, <China renewable energy outlook 2019, {eid: 85101131934}>, <None, {eid: 85101164362}>, <Technology features of the new generation power system in China, {eid: 85051245830}>, <Comparison of the grid support capability of DFIG-based wind farms and conventional power plants with synchronous generators, {eid: 71849092708}>, <Study on technical bottleneck of new energy development, {eid: 85018777877}>, <Framework of problems in large scale wind integration, {eid: 84897126368}>, <Key scientific issues and theoretical research framework for power systems with high proportion of renewable energy, {eid: 85021001702}>, <The impact of power electronics interfaces on power system frequency control: a review, {eid: 85074953109}>, <Power systems with high renewable energy sources: a review of inertia and frequency control strategies over time, {eid: 85071919439}>, <Stability definitions and characterization of dynamic behavior in systems with high penetration of power electronic interfaced technologies, {eid: 85089553256}>, <Comparison of short-circuit current contribution of Doubly-fed induction generator based wind turbines and synchronous generator, {eid: 84890884122}>, <Practice and challenge of renewable energy development based on interconnected power grids, {eid: 85035144735}>, <GB 38755-2019 Code on security and stability for power system, {eid: 85091210618}>, <Effects of increasing power electronics on system stability: results from MIGRATE questionnaire, {eid: 85062832628}>, <Studies on the stability issues about large scale wind farm grid integration, {eid: 77951475532}>, <Definition and classification of power system stability IEEE/CIGRE joint task force on stability terms and definitions, {eid: 4043101022}>, <System stability impact of large-scale and distributed solar photovoltaic generation: the case of Ontario, Canada, {eid: 84880272691}>, <Small-signal stability of wind power system with full-load converter interfaced wind turbines, {eid: 84866665828}>, <Effect of variable speed wind turbine generator on stability of a weak grid, {eid: 33947625133}>, <Impact of grid connection of large-scale wind farms on power system small-signal angular stability, {eid: 84971240476}>, <Assessment and enhancement of small signal stability of a renewable-energy-based electricity distribution system, {eid: 84883251233}>, <Voltage and transient stability support by wind farms complying with the E.

All right reserved.In view of the volatility of the wind farm output and the inaccuracy of the wind prediction, a digital twin hybrid energy storage (DTHES) based control strategy is proposed to optimize the operating efficiency of the energy storage equipment. The strategy considers the fluctuation of the wind power grid connection, the error of the prediction results and the efficiency of the energy storage equipment. Firstly, the Attention-GRU prediction model is established by introducing the Attention mechanism into the gated recurrent unit. Then, combined with the grid-connected power fluctuation standard and the response characteristics of different energy storage devices, the virtual variational mode decomposition (VVMD) is performed on the digital twin prediction data to obtain the primary distributed power. Finally, considering the limitations of the operating efficiency and service life of the energy storage equipment, the hybrid energy storage service system is used to modify the primary distributed power of the virtual hybrid energy storage to obtain the final distributed power. Experiments based on the wind power plant data in a certain area of Northeast China have verified that the strategy can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the wind power prediction, suppress the fluctuation of the wind power grid connection effectively, and enhance the utilization efficiency of the energy storage equipment.","Digital twin, Hybrid energy storage, Power fluctuation, Wind power prediction",,,,,,,,"<Value of nas energy storage toward integrating wind: results from the wind to battery project, {eid: 84872850231}>, <Hybrid energy storage for smoothing wind power fluctuations based on fuzzy control, {eid: 85007021030}>, <A review on the selected applications of forecasting models in renewable power systems, {eid: 85055283929}>, <Forecasting energy consumption using ensemble ARIMA-ANFIS hybrid algorithm, {eid: 84961825685}>, <Current status and future advances for wind speed and power forecasting, {eid: 84892960976}>, <Short-term wind speed prediction based on robust Kalman filtering: an experimental comparison, {eid: 84937875109}>, <Review on wind speed prediction based on spatial correlation, {eid: 85021357809}>, <A review on wind power prediction based on spatial correlation approach, {eid: 84905124758}>, <Research prospects of improvement in wind power forecasting based on characteristics of monsoons, {eid: 84946415497}>, <A hybrid forecasting method for wind power ramp based on Orthogonal Test and Support Vector Machine (OT-SVM), {eid: 85027516547}>, <A new method based on Type-2 fuzzy neural network for accurate wind power forecasting under uncertain data, {eid: 85039847236}>, <A short-term load forecasting based on LSTM neural network, {eid: 85059899062}>, <Short-term load forecasting model based on Attention-LSTM in electricity market, {eid: 85068861614}>, <None, {eid: 85109488104}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: a new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Opportunities and challenges of the digital twin in power system applications, {eid: 85086633400}>, <Digital twin framework and its application to power grid online analysis, {eid: 85077253897}>, <Ultra-short-term prediction of photovoltaic power generation based on digital twins, {eid: 85104510501}>, <Machine health monitoring using local feature-based gated recurrent unit networks, {eid: 85028972254}>, <A sequence-to-sequence air quality predictor based on the n-step recurrent prediction, {eid: 85064813982}>, <Variational mode decomposition, {eid: 84893418756}>, <Application of hybrid energy storage technology based on wavelet packet decomposition in smoothing the fluctuations of wind power, {eid: 84881590954}>, <Optimal control of wind ramp based on very short-term wind forecast and hybrid ESS, {eid: 85018582884}>, <The spectral kurtosis: a useful tool for characterising non-stationary signals, {eid: 27744587461}>, <None, {eid: 85109556419}>",,,Power System Technology Press,,,7/5/2021,,,,,,,chi,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85109478754

Based on the main characteristics of DT, five performance indices for maturity evaluation of DT projects were proposed. By reviewing the history of power system simulation tools, reasons why the power system could not breed the concept of DT were discussed, and differences between DT and traditional power system simulation were concluded. On this basis, both direction and enabling fields of DT in power systems were predicted. Following this, several main construction techniques of DT were also introduced. Finally, a case study on the heat pump switching control based on DT of the heating system was conducted, which aimed to show the basic characteristics of DT, and to illustrate the proposed maturity evaluation method.","Digital twin, Maturity evaluation, New power system",,,,,,,,"<Theory of digital twin modeling and its application, {eid: 85100967892}>, <Digital twin: manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <DRAFT modeling, simulation, information technology & processing roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <Digital twin workshop: a new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <Five-dimension digital twin model and its ten applications, {eid: 85064443425}>, <A systematic review of a digital twin city: a new pattern of urban governance toward smart cities, {eid: 85103699862}>, <An ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework for health and well-being in smart cities, {eid: 85086741550}>, <Human digital twin for fitness management, {eid: 85081154665}>, <Introducing digital twins to agriculture, {eid: 85102421457}>, <Opportunities and challenges of the digital twin in power system applications, {eid: 85086633400}>, <When smart grid meets digital twin, {eid: 85124799517}>, <Digital twin technology for smart power generation and its application modes, {eid: 85151135156}>, <Application status and development prospects of digital twin technology in condition assessment of power transmission and transformation equipment, {eid: 85107428869}>, <Digital twin of the energy internet and its application, {eid: 85170566694}>, <Framework design and application prospect for digital twins system of energy internet, {eid: 85112775217}>, <Real-time online analysis of power grid, {eid: 85091591739}>, <Application of digital twin assistant-system in state estimation for inverter dominated grid, {eid: 85095575749}>, <Multi agent coordinated optimal control strategy for smart microgrid based on digital twin drive, {eid: 85107597542}>, <A digital twin approach for fault diagnosis in distributed photovoltaic systems, {eid: 85074215768}>, <On the implementation of Iot-based digital twin for networked microgrids resiliency against cyber attacks, {eid: 85094810910}>, <Pilot protection of flexible DC grid based on digital twin, {eid: 85124804803, doi: 10.13334/j.0258-8013.pcsee.202045}>, <For a digital twin of the grid: Siemens solution enables a single digital grid model of the Finnish power system, {eid: 85064141464}>, <Analytic engine for the digital power plant, {eid: 85086269269}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Virtually intelligent product systems: digital and physical twins, {eid: 85075725280}>, <Digital twin: transform your operations with data-driven and simulation-based digital twin software, {eid: 85124787315}>, <Cold thinking about digital twin and modeling and simulation techniques behind it, {eid: 85106371818}>, <Discussing digital twin from of modeling and simulation, {eid: 85106363686}>, <Digital twins: the convergence of multimedia technologies, {eid: 85051272175}>, <Customer experience challenges: bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twins for iot applications, {eid: 85124793650}>, <Digital power system, {eid: 0001550337}>",,,Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering,,,1/20/2022,,,,,,,chi,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85124807412

Based on advanced control, metering, and communication technologies, the virtual power plant (VPP) aggregates massive diversified and distributed energy resources (DERs) on the demand side, which can provide necessary flexible support for the power system through diversified adjustment methods, and simultaneously facilitate renewable energy integration. The digital twin (DT) uses digital technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence to model the characteristics, behavior, process, and performance of the physical entities of DERs, which is an ideal way to optimize the operation of VPP. In this article, firstly, the technology development of VPP is prospected. Then, based on the concept, architecture, and characteristics of DT, a DT VPP system (DTVPPS) is proposed. The connotation of the DTVPPS is explained in-depth, and a framework based on physical entities, virtual spaces, DT data, connections, and intelligent applications is projected. Finally, the key technologies of DTVPPS are analyzed, and its future application practices are summarized and prospected.","digital power grid, digital twin, frame design, virtual power
