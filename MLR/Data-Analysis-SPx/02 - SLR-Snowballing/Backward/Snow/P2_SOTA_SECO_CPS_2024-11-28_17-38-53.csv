All rights reserved.Large-scale cyber-physical systems such as manufacturing lines generate vast amounts of data to guarantee precise control of their machinery. Visions such as the Industrial Internet of Things aim at making this data available also to computation systems outside the lines to increase productivity and product quality. However, rising amounts and complexities of data and control decisions push existing infrastructure for data transmission, storage, and processing to its limits. In this paper, we exemplarily study a fine blanking line which can produce up to 6.2 Gbit/s worth of data to showcase the extreme requirements found in modern manufacturing. We consequently propose integrated data processing which keeps inherently local and small-scale tasks close to the processes while at the same time centralizing tasks relying on more complex decision procedures and remote data sources. Our approach thus allows for both maintaining control of field-level processes and leveraging the benefits of “big data” applications.",,,,,,,,,"<Industrial cyberphysical systems: A backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, {eid: 85017598124}>, <Industrial internet of things and cyber manufacturing systems, {eid: 85002143570}>, <Drivers of digital transformation in manufacturing, {eid: 85065769623}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Industrial big data analytics and cyber-physical systems for future maintenance & service innovation, {eid: 84964030208}>, <Promoting work-based learning through INDUSTRY 4.0, {eid: 84939782065}>, <Concept of predictive maintenance of production systems in accordance with industry 4.0, {eid: 85017601893}>, <A comprehensive approach to privacy in the cloud-based internet of things, {eid: 84958927315}>, <Value creation in big data scenarios: A literature survey, {eid: 85032867605}>, <Networking for big data: A survey, {eid: 85014086530}>, <Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity, {eid: 84864030546}>, <None, {eid: 84876494973}>, <Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics, {eid: 84919389514}>, <The three generations of field-level networks - Evolution and compatibility issues, {eid: 77957990921}>, <Secure low latency communication for constrained industrial IoT scenarios, {eid: 85081223224}>, <None, {eid: 79956288646}>, <None, {eid: 57949086855}>, <Dependencies of the die-roll height during fine blanking of case hardening steel 16mncr5 without v-ring using a nesting strategy, {eid: 85037145302}>, <Application of the finite-element deformation method in the fine blanking process, {eid: 0030783406}>, <Setup of a parameterized FE model for the die roll prediction in fine blanking using artificial neural networks, {eid: 85032456354}>, <A study on the effect of V-ring position on the die roll height in fine blanking for special automobile seat recliner gear, {eid: 85108289415}>, <Finite element analysis on the effect of die clearance on shear planes in fine blanking, {eid: 0037147015}>, <None, {eid: 0012432442}>, <In-line characterisation of microstructure and mechanical properties in the manufacturing of steel strip for the purpose of product uniformity con, {eid: 85029182269}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling innovation in campus networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <Outlier detection techniques for wireless sensor networks: A survey, {eid: 77955082590}>, <P4: Programming protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <None, {eid: 85108297203}>, <None, {eid: 33845345317}>, <IEC 61499: Back to the well proven practice of IEC 61131?, {eid: 84876359222}>, <None, {eid: 84881178310}>, <NetSlices: Scalable multi-core packet processing in user-space, {eid: 84962239212}>, <PacketShader: A GPU-accelerated software router, {eid: 78149305172}>, <Santa: Faster packet delivery for commonly wished replies, {eid: 85070885862}>, <NetMap: A novel framework for fast packet I/O, {eid: 84869422868}>, <The BSD packet filter: A new architecture for user-level packet capture, {eid: 85077206746}>, <Demo: Towards in-network processing for low-latency industrial control, {eid: 85090495125}>, <Towards in-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <Symperf: Predicting network function performance, {eid: 85029674747}>, <Arbitrary packet matching in OpenFlow, {eid: 85045691393}>, <Tasklets:”Better than best-effort” computing, {eid: 85108302073}>, <Quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for convexity, {eid: 80053166276}>, <A trust point-based security architecture for sensor data in the cloud, {eid: 84930362469}>, <Network security and privacy for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85048338526}>, <The 8 requirements of real-time stream processing, {eid: 31444440239}>, <Edge computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 84987842183}>, <Intelligent workload factoring for a hybrid cloud computing model, {eid: 72849118793}>, <Big data: Principles and best practices of scalable real-time data systems, {eid: 84959055122}>, <Streaming big data processing in datacenter clouds, {eid: 84961627543}>, <RDBMS to NoSQL: Reviewing some next-generation non-relational databases, {eid: 84877775758}>, <None, {eid: 85092746391}>, <Brewers conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services, {eid: 1542640153}>, <Perspectives on the cap theorem, {eid: 84869219414}>, <A survey of open source tools for machine learning with big data in the Hadoop ecosystem, {eid: 85013974691}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,1/8/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85108268408

All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

Based on these findings, we point to future research needs, highlighting the need for further empirical evidence and improved collaboration between the academic fields of Industry 4.0, human factors, and ergonomics, as well as with practitioners.","Cyber Physical Systems, Digitalization, Ergonomics, Human factors, Industry 4.0, Literature review",,,,,,,,"<The work system method: connecting people,

The IDS represents a multi-sided platform (MSP) for secure and trusted data exchange, which is governed by an institutionalized alliance of different stakeholder organizations. The paper delivers insights gained during the early stages of the platform’s lifecycle (i.e. the platform design process). More specifically, it provides answers to three research questions, namely how alliance-driven MSPs come into existence and evolve, how different stakeholder groups use certain governance mechanisms during the platform design process, and how this process is influenced by regulatory instruments. By contrasting the case of an alliance-driven MSP with the more common approach of the keystone-driven MSP, the results of the case study suggest that different evolutionary paths can be pursued during the early stages of an MSP’s lifecycle. Furthermore, the IDS initiative considers trust and data sovereignty more relevant regulatory instruments compared to pricing, for example. Finally, the study advances the body of scientific knowledge with regard to data being a boundary resource on MSPs.","Alliance-driven platform, Case study research, Data resource, Data sovereignty, International Data Spaces, Multi-sided data platform",,,,,,,,"<Ecosystem as structure, {eid: 85004107267, doi: 10.1177/0149206316678451}>, <The architecture of platforms: A unified view, {eid: 71949126345}>, <Investigating information systems with action research, {eid: 0002437413}>, <Developing multi-sided platforms for public-private information sharing, {eid: 84880563255}>, <Open platform strategies and innovation: granting access vs. devolving control, {eid: 77958033399, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.1100.1215}>, <Platform rules: multi-sided platforms as regulators, {eid: 77958062188}>, <Data Provenance: Some Basic Issues, {eid: 84947733945, doi: 10.1007/3-540-44450-5_6}>, <The evolution of platform thinking, {eid: 73649131660, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629189}>, <The role of platform boundary resources in software ecosystems: A case study, {eid: 84903734525}>, <The digital platform: a research agenda, {eid: 85018241471, doi: 10.1057/s41265-016-0033-3}>, <Defining architecture components of the big data ecosystem, {eid: 84906250101}>, <Generalizability and the single-case study, {eid: 0002228543}>, <None, {eid: 41849141359}>, <Distributed tuning of boundary resources: the case of Apples iOS service system, {eid: 84939781260, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2015/39.1.10}>, <Opening platforms: how, when and why?, {eid: 77958042047}>, <None, {eid: 85063569734}>, <The antitrust economics of multi-sided platform markets, {eid: 33846819331}>, <None, {eid: 84923304921, doi: 10.3386/w18783}>, <From databases to dataspaces, {eid: 31444453796, doi: 10.1145/1107499.1107502}>, <Platform dynamics and strategies: from products to services, {eid: 85040190478, doi: 10.4337/9781849803311}>, <Bridging differing perspectives on technological platforms: Toward an integrative framework, {eid: 84902550958, doi: 10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006}>, <Industry platforms and ecosystem innovation, {eid: 84898004011, doi: 10.1111/jpim.12105}>, <Governing third-party development through platform boundary resources, {eid: 84870963683}>, <A paradigmatic analysis of digital application marketplaces, {eid: 84939806687, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.16}>, <Context interchange: new features and formalisms for the intelligent integration of information, {eid: 0000876805, doi: 10.1145/314516.314520}>, <Two-sided platforms: product variety and pricing structures, {eid: 70350278738, doi: 10.1111/j.1530-9134.2009.00236.x}>, <Principles of dataspace systems, {eid: 34250660624}>, <VoCol: An Integrated Environment to Support Version-Controlled Vocabulary Development, {eid: 84997132390, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_20}>, <The generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution, {eid: 84887414769, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.3.11}>, <A Policy Language for Distributed Usage Control, {eid: 38049040380, doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-74835-9_35}>, <Requirements engineering as a success factor in software projects, {eid: 0035393371, doi: 10.1109/MS.2001.936219}>, <Requirements of an open data based business ecosystem, {eid: 84910094976, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2302872}>, <Data-centric intelligent information integration—from concepts to automation, {eid: 84949106206, doi: 10.1007/s10844-014-0340-5}>, <Towards a policy enforcement infrastructure for distributed usage control, {eid: 84864041384}>, <Designing data governance, {eid: 73649138928, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629210}>, <Energy disclosure, market behavior, and the building data ecosystem, {eid: 84881546623, doi: 10.1111/nyas.12163}>, <None, {eid: 85050213166}>, <A review and future direction of agile, business intelligence, analytics and data science, {eid: 84966326638, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.04.013}>, <Towards a user-centric personal data ecosystem: The role of the bank of individuals data, {eid: 84871909125}>, <Management of the master data lifecycle: a framework for analysis, {eid: 84879700770, doi: 10.1108/JEIM-05-2013-0026}>, <The impact of openness on the market potential of multi-sided platforms: a case study of mobile payment platforms, {eid: 84939798226, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.7}>, <None, {eid: 85007218223}>, <None, {eid: 85020490036}>, <None, {eid: 85072047817}>, <Open source as enabler for OPC UA in industrial automation, {eid: 84952898892}>, <A design science research methodology for information systems research, {eid: 39749104751, doi: 10.2753/MIS0742-1222240302}>, <Distributed usage control, {eid: 33748543201, doi: 10.1145/1151030.1151053}>, <The theory contribution of case study research designs, {eid: 85050626091, doi: 10.1007/s40685-017-0045-z}>, <FIWARE Open Source Standard Platform in Smart Farming -

All rights reserved.Goal: The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of inserting a collaborative robot in a production line of a factory of the automotive sector. Design / Methodology / Approach: Two simulation environments were developed. The first one models the original operation without the collaborative robot. The second one evaluates the impact of inserting the robot. This work is quantitative. Results: The paper presents the use of digital manufacturing tools in a simulation of a collaborative operation between a human and a collaborative robot. The simulations with and without the collaborative robot were performed, and they make it possible to empha-size the benefits of the collaborative operation in a real production line. Limitations of the investigation: The first simulation scenario was validated from the real data provided by the factory. However, the second scenario is a suggestion, emphasizing the benefits of collaborative operation. Implementation of the second scenario was not conducted. Practical implications: Since its completion depended on support from the automotive sector, this work is noticeably practical. The real data used in the first scenario as well as the assumptions made in the second scenario allow one to conclude that it is possible to implement the propositions with the collaborative robot in the chosen line. Originality / Value: The use of the collaborative robot in Brazil was forbidden by regula-tion until recently. Even in other countries decision makers still find have difficulty decid-ing for this new technology. For this reason, the benefits of using collaborative robots, mainly in Brazilian companies, is still not clear. This work contributes to the collaborative robot discussion and consequently to Industry 4.0 implementation by creating a digital twin of an existing process and inserting a collaborative robot in it. The results should be used by decision makers to decide for inserting this technology in their factories.","Collaborative robotics, Digital manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Integration of a Skill-based Collaborative Mobile Robot in a Smart Cyber--physical Environment, {eid: 85029951065}>, <Formal model of human erroneous behavior for safety analysis in collaborative robotics, {eid: 85059693851}>, <Dynamic task classifica-tion and assignment for the management of human-robot collaborative teams in workcells, {eid: 85049641196}>, <Learning-based endovascular navigation through the use of non-rigid registration for collaborative robotic cathe-terization, {eid: 85045278827}>, <Interactive Simulation of Human-robot Collaboration Using a Force Feed-back Device, {eid: 85029889560}>, <Industrie 4.0: Hit or Hype?, {eid: 84903134983}>, <Language-free graphical signa-ge improves human performance and reduces anxiety when working collaboratively with robots, {eid: 85053812237}>, <Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios, {eid: 84975454820}>, <None, {eid: 0003884788}>, <None, {eid: 0004253213}>, <None, {eid: 85060532808}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Security framework for industrial collaborative robotic cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85042714903}>, <A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing sys-tems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Past, present and future of Industry 4.0-a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal, {eid: 85018651607}>, <A framework for human collaborative robots, operations in South African automotive industry, {eid: 84962018637}>, <Flexible programming and orchestration of collaborative robotic manufacturing systems, {eid: 85055563658}>, <None, {eid: 85147182923}>, <Application of mixed reality in robot manipulator programming, {eid: 85058018578}>, <Hu-man-oriented design of collaborative robots, {eid: 85007487613}>, <How connectivity and search for producers impact production in industry 4.0 networks, {eid: 85095680577}>, <Industry 4.0: glitter or gold?

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.","Data fusion, digital twin (DT), industry application, modeling",,,,,,,,"<Smart manufacturing must

We claim that these directions can be effectively and efficiently addressed through the adoption of innovative quality-aware edge cloud computing platforms for the design, implementation, and runtime support of distributed AI solutions that execute on both global cloud resources and edge nodes in industrial plant premises. In particular, the paper presents the first experiences that we are doing within the framework of the H2020 Innovation Action IoTwins, for the implementation and optimization of distributed hybrid twins in the IIoT application domains of predictive maintenance and manufacturing optimization. IoTwins exploits distributed hybrid twins, partly executing at edge cloud nodes in industrial plant localities, to perform process/fault predictions and manufacturing line reconfigurations under time constraints, also by enabling some forms of sovereignty on industrial monitoring data. In addition, the paper overviews our original taxonomy of the stateof-the-art research literature about distributed AI for decentralized learning, with specific focus on federated settings and on emerging trends for the IIoT domain.","Decentralized Learning, Distributed Digital Twins, Edge Cloud Computing, Industrial Internet of Things, IoTwins",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075919336}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <ERDT: Energy-efficient reliable decision transmission for intelligent cooperative spectrum sensing in industrial lot, {eid: 84961080078}>, <A development approach for collective opportunistic Edge-of-Things services, {eid: 85066250704}>, <The Promise of Edge Computing, {eid: 84969922595}>, <None, {eid: 85075912345}>, <Enabling smart cities through a cognitive management framework for the internet of things, {eid: 84879097737}>, <None, {eid: 85075950973}>, <None, {eid: 85075942628}>, <None, {eid: 85070075435}>, <None, {eid: 85075946335}>, <None, {eid: 85075908970}>, <Large scale distributed deep networks, {eid: 84877760312}>, <Deep learning with elastic averaging SGD, {eid: 84965152276}>, <None, {eid: 85011018077}>, <None, {eid: 85037742095}>, <None, {eid: 85071319404}>, <None, {eid: 84997445201}>, <Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis, {eid: 33745556605}>, <Our data, ourselves: Privacy via distributed noise generation, {eid: 33746037200}>, <The algorithmic foundations of differential privacy, {eid: 84905991151}>, <Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data, {eid: 85083937116}>, <None, {eid: 85064803536}>, <Deep Models under the GAN: Information leakage from collaborative deep learning, {eid: 85041437863}>, <None, {eid: 85072921653}>, <None, {eid: 85050988696}>, <None, {eid: 85060311764}>, <Practical secure aggregation for privacy-preserving machine learning, {eid: 85041432607}>, <Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Additively Homomorphic Encryption, {eid: 85040063992}>, <None, {eid: 85061175448}>, <None, {eid: 85075934363}>, <None, {eid: 85075954814}>, <None, {eid: 85072559936}>, <None, {eid: 85061192207}>, <None, {eid: 85072110535}>, <None, {eid: 85045348132}>, <None, {eid: 85084160327}>, <CPSGD: Communication-efficient and differentially-private distributed SGD, {eid: 85064805388}>, <None, {eid: 85075914667}>, <None, {eid: 85073230150}>, <None, {eid: 85075921960}>, <None, {eid: 85075923069}>, <Gossip learning as a decentralized alternative to federated learning.

As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.","CAD, Model-Driven Systems Engineering, SysML, Tool Integration",,,,,,,,"<Model-driven development of complex software: a research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Software language engineering in the large: Towards composing and deriving languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <SysML is the point of departure for mbse, not the destination, {eid: 80052623372}>, <None, {eid: 84919373075}>, <None, {eid: 0342781123}>, <Systems engineering manual, {eid: 85075954900}>, <None, {eid: 0003600234}>, <INCOSE, {eid: 85075953189}>, <None, {eid: 84954540930}>, <Model-based systems engineering: An emerging approach for modern systems, {eid: 84655170010}>, <None, {eid: 85068588523}>, <None, {eid: 77953971545}>, <Applying model based systems engineering (MBSE) to A standard CubeSat, {eid: 84861121452}>, <None, {eid: 85051164680}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <None, {eid: 0003717921}>, <None, {eid: 0041161422}>, <Enabling multi-view modeling with sysml profiles and model transformations, {eid: 80054075181}>, <Multiview modeling to support embedded systems engineering in sysml, {eid: 78649514950}>, <An introduction to multi-paradigm modelling and simulation, {eid: 0012303245}>, <A sysml-based methodology for manufacturing machinery modeling and design, {eid: 80052622398}>, <Effort to accelerate mbse adoption and usage at JSC, {eid: 85044445140}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,9/15/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85075936044

To accommodate the increasing demand of agility, flexibility, and low cost in healthcare sector, a data-driven reconfigurable production mode of Smart Factory for pharmaceutical manufacturing is proposed in this paper. The architecture of the Smart Factory is consisted of three primary layers, namely perception layer, deployment layer, and executing layer. A Manufacturing's Semantics Ontology based knowledgebase is introduced in the perception layer, which is responsible for plan scheduling of pharmaceutical production.

To further functionality reconfiguration and low-level controlling, the IEC 61499 standard is also introduced for functionality modeling and machine controlling.

So far, single stakeholders only had to consider their local view on security. However, for a global lab, we identify several fundamental research challenges in (dynamic) scenarios with multiple stakeholders: While information security mandates that models must be adapted wrt. confidentiality to address these new influences on business secrets, from a network perspective, the drastically increasing amount of possible attack vectors challenges today's approaches.

In such environments, attackers can derive sensitive private information of IoT device owners, e.g., daily routines or secret supply chain procedures, when sniffing on IoT communication and linking IoT devices and owner. Furthermore, untrusted networks do not provide IoT devices with any protection against attacks from the Internet. Anonymous communication using onion routing provides a well-proven mechanism to keep the relationshIP between communication partners secret and (optionally) protect against network attacks. However, the application of onion routing is challenged by protocol incompatibilities and demanding cryptographic processing on constrained IoT devices, rendering its use infeasible. To close this gap, we tailor onion routing to the IoT by bridging protocol incompatibilities and offloading expensive cryptographic processing to a router or web server of the IoT device owner. Thus, we realize resource-conserving access control and end-toend security for IoT devices. To prove applicability, we deploy onion routing for the IoT within the well-established Tor network enabling IoT devices to leverage its resources to achieve the same grade of anonymity as readily available to traditional devices.",,,,,,,,,"<The study and application of the IoT in pet systems, {eid: 85054182736}>, <Iot based localization and tracking, {eid: 85039970096}>, <Using internet of

Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND licenseThe high availability of data as well as intelligent analysis methods are central points of “Industrie 4.0”. However, companies often miss their opportunities because they are not able use available information. In times of a dynamic market environment, it is essential for companies to build up a detailed understanding of the influences on their business based on data. Especially in product development and life cycle management, the use of data-generated knowledge can significantly increase the productivity. The problem is not a lack of information but an information overload, as companies are generating more data than they are actually able to use. At the same time, it is crucial that decision-makers have access to the right information for the right purpose at the right time. Which means, the primarily reason for a lack of data-based decisions is the availability of suitable data. Especially the identification and preparation of data for certain analyses causes a high delay and therefore a decrease of decision quality. A multi-perspective and database-overarching information model of products is necessary to overcome incomprehensibility of information, undefined data structures and inflexibility of systems. The methodology presented in this paper describes the derivation of such an information model, which is collecting and merging selected information from existing databases for business intelligence applications. Key element of the method is the choice of a suitable data source for the required information. Therefore, a data-information-fit-indicator is introduced to enable the assignment of data sources to information of the information model.","Data analytics, Life cycle management, Product information",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84858817001}>, <Making advanced analytics work for you, {eid: 84866692693}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <A knowledge management framework for identifying innovation potentials from use phase information, {eid: 84980043476}>, <Big Data consumer analytics and the transformation of marketing, {eid: 84949320986}>, <Design of a data structure for the order processing as a basis for data analytics methods, {eid: 85016193370}>, <Reconfiguration of smart products during their use phase based on virtual product twins, {eid: 85018758116}>, <Herausforderung electronic business, {eid: 85067206526}>, <None, {eid: 85018936265}>, <An incident information management framework based on data integration, data mining, and multi-criteria decision making, {eid: 79953753719}>, <Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment, {eid: 84892717180}>, <Product relationships management enabler for concurrent engineering and product lifecycle management, {eid: 84881546901}>, <None, {eid: 85006966292}>, <Towards a smart services enabling information architecture for installed base management in manufacturing, {eid: 85061344670}>, <None, {eid: 85067183324}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <The challenges of data quality and data quality assessment in the big data era, {eid: 84973293300}>, <Requirements for data quality metrics, {eid: 85041435827}>, <None, {eid: 79961039499}>, <Data-based determination of the product-oriented complexity degree, {eid: 85051260573}>, <None, {eid: 84869476353}>, <A framework for Big Data driven product lifecycle management, {eid: 85020025572}>, <Informationsqualität - Definitionen, Dimensionen und Begriffe, {eid: 84870628200}>, <None, {eid: 85038121385}>, <Reconstructing the giant, {eid: 79955849845}>, <Digital Twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85016450943}>, <Digital Shadow - From production to product, {eid: 85049153402}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Product avatar as digital counterpart of a physical individual product, {eid: 85056510533}>, <Enabling smart manufacturing research and development using a product lifecycle test bed, {eid: 85013432286}>, <Testing the digital thread in support of model-based manufacturing and inspection, {eid: 84963830373}>, <The digital shadow of production, {eid: 85049581408}>, <Der Digitale Schatten in der Auftragsabwicklung, {eid: 84992547436}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85067203327}>, <None, {eid: 0141619679}>, <None, {eid: 84886783889}>, <A method for demand-driven information requirements analysis in data warehousing projects, {eid: 84969556051}>, <None, {eid: 2442463710}>, <Methodology for the derivation of a digital shadow for engineering management, {eid: 85056551092}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,5/7/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85067176432

Enabling a fine-grained sharing and analysis of data among different stakeholders in an automated manner, such a vision of an Internet of Production (IoP) introduces demanding challenges to the communication, storage, and computation infrastructure in production environments. In this work, we present three example cases that would benefit from an IoP (a fine blanking line, a high pressure die casting process, and a connected job shop) and derive requirements that cannot be met by today's infrastructure. In particular, we identify three orthogonal research objectives: (i) real-time control of tightly integrated production processes to offer seamless low-latency analysis and execution, (ii) storing and processing heterogeneous production data to support scalable data stream processing and storage, and (iii) secure privacy-aware collaboration in production to provide a basis for secure industrial collaboration. Based on a discussion of state-of-the-art approaches for these three objectives, we create a blueprint for an infrastructure acting as an enabler for an IoP.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Processing, Internet of Production, Low Latency, Secure Industrial Collaboration",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 81055138684}>, <Drivers of digital transformation in manufacturing, {eid: 85065769623}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <None, {eid: 85002143570}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <None, {eid: 79956288646}>, <None, {eid: 57949086855}>, <Dependencies of the die-roll height during fine blanking of case hardening steel 16MnCr5 without V-ring using a nesting strategy, {eid: 85037145302}>, <None, {eid: 0012432442}>, <A predictive model for die roll height in fine blanking using machine learning methods, {eid: 85063770278}>, <Concept of predictive maintenance of production systems in accordance with industry 4.0, {eid: 85017601893}>, <Lightweight of a cross beam for commercial vehicles: Development, testing and validation, {eid: 85045427430}>, <High-pressure die-casting: Contradictions and challenges, {eid: 84939939090}>, <None, {eid: 85052894615}>, <An agile information processing framework for high pressure die casting applications in modern manufacturing systems, {eid: 84968732836}>, <Process-parallel virtual quality evaluation for metal cutting in series production, {eid: 85108303167}>, <Network security and privacy for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85048338526}>, <Open flow: Enabling innovation in campus networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <P4: Programming Protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <Towards In-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <Edge computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 84987842183}>, <Netmap: A Novel framework for Fast Packet I/O, {eid: 84869422868}>, <Santa: Faster packet delivery for commonly wished replies, {eid: 85070885862}>, <Requirements and current solutions of wireless communication in industrial automation, {eid: 85062860931}>, <Quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for convexity, {eid: 80053166276}>, <Big Data Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data Systems, 1st ed, {eid: 84959055122}>, <None, {eid: 84957632624}>, <Samza: Stateful scalable stream processing at linkedin, {eid: 85036620015}>, <None, {eid: 85036661936}>, <Data wrangling: The challenging journey from the wild to the lake, {eid: 84962769228}>, <Managing Googles data lake: An overview of the Goods system, {eid: 85021243177}>, <Azure data lake store: A hyperscale distributed file service for big data analytics, {eid: 85021237374}>, <Constance: An intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <CLAMS: Bringing quality to data lakes, {eid: 84979715990}>, <Personal data lake with data gravity pull, {eid: 84962738960}>, <Crossing the finish line faster when paddling the Data Lake with Kayak, {eid: 85036628576}>, <The semantic web, {eid: 79551602978}>, <Query rewriting for heterogeneous data lakes, {eid: 85070871891}>, <Applying semantics to reduce the time to analytics within complex heterogeneous infrastructures, {eid: 85064130056}>, <Introduction to secure outsourcing computation, {eid: 85019176675}>, <Secure multiparty computation for privacy-preserving data mining, {eid: 85056056886}>, <Privacy-Preserving comparison of cloud exposure induced by mobile apps, {eid: 85052500678}>, <Blockchain-based database to ensure data integrity in cloud computing environments, {eid: 85049069762}>, <ABY-A framework for efficient mixed-protocol secure two-party computation, {eid: 85004105441}>, <Schema extraction for privacy preserving processing of sensitive data, {eid: 85049686273}>, <Incentives build robustness in BitTorrent, {eid: 85070863299}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/6/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85070900711

Real-time Computer Vision (CV), with its high data rates and often mission- and safety-critical roles in the control of autonomous vehicles and industrial machinery, could particularly benefit from executing parts of its logic within network elements. In this paper, we thus explore what it takes to bring CV to the network. We present our work-in-progress efforts of implementing a line-following algorithm based on convolution filters on a P4-programmable NIC. We find that by appropriately identifying regions of interest in the image data and by diligently distributing the necessary calculations among the various match/action stages of the ingress- and egress pipelines of the NIC, our prototypical implementation can achieve over 19 decisions per second on 640x480 px grayscale images with filters large enough to guide a small autonomous car through various courses.","Computer vision, Convolution filters, In-network processing, P4",,,,,,,,"<An FPGA 2D-convolution unit based on the CAPH language, {eid: 84944710381}>, <Color-to-grayscale algorithms effect on edge detection - A comparative study, {eid: 85048578798}>, <None, {eid: 85059875579}>, <P4: Programming protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <Forwarding metamorphosis: Fast programmable match-action processing in hardware for SDN, {eid: 84891621909}>, <Orbital edge computing: Machine inference in space, {eid: 85064643670}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <Project AutoVIsion: Localization and 3D scene perception for an autonomous vehicle with a multi-camera system, {eid: 85071462448}>, <None, {eid: 85030212949}>, <None, {eid: 84988340112}>, <NetCache: Balancing key-value stores with fast in-network caching, {eid: 85041680951}>, <A FPGA parameterizable multi-layer architecture for CNNs, {eid: 85073423134}>, <Real time vision-based measurements for quality control of industrial rods on a moving conveyor, {eid: 85020502429}>, <Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, {eid: 84876231242}>, <Online reprogrammable multi tenant switches, {eid: 85078934823}>, <Offloading real-time DDoS attack detection to programmable data planes, {eid: 85067068832}>, <The case for network-accelerated query processing, {eid: 85084016581}>, <Just say no to Paxos overhead: Replacing consensus with network ordering, {eid: 85076943541}>, <The three Rs of computer vision: Recognition, reconstruction and reorganization, {eid: 84961138317}>, <Silkroad: Making stateful layer-4 load balancing fast and cheap using switching ASICs, {eid: 85029443821}>, <None, {eid: 85080370169}>, <Passive vision region-based road detection: A literature review, {eid: 85063336759}>, <Towards in-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <In-network computation is a dumb idea whose time has come, {eid: 85041220007}>, <None, {eid: 85066886801}>, <Visual SLAM and structure from motion in dynamic environments: A survey, {eid: 85042601417}>, <Edge detection of color images using directional operators, {eid: 0031120983}>, <Smart packets: Applying active networks to network management, {eid: 0041080781}>, <Heavy-hitter detection entirely in the data plane, {eid: 85018957154}>, <Towards an active network architecture, {eid: 0030124838}>, <None, {eid: 85055083615}>, <Progression and evaluation of a camera-based measurement system for multifuel burners under industrial process conditions, {eid: 85073360927}>, <Bandwidth-efficient live video analytics for drones via edge computing, {eid: 85060257755}>, <The SoftNet project: A retrospect, {eid: 0024122048}>, <Object class detection: A survey, {eid: 84887503589}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,12/9/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85078956735

However, collecting, storing and processing data is going to be a standard procedure in this domain. This includes data from sensors, machines, and processes as well as individual data about people. Recent approaches such as assistive systems for human-computer and human-machine interaction need more personal data than ever before to provide purposeful, tailored support. For MDE approaches it is important to consider privacy already on model level. This paper discusses a way to create privacy-preserving IoT systems using an MDE approach to support privacy and data transparency. We show the relevance and application on a use case from industrial production processes. Additionally, we discuss abilities for practical realization and its limitation.","Domain-Specific Languages, Generated Enterprise Information Systems, Information Portals, Internet of Things, Model-Based Software Engineering Privacy-By-Design, Privacy Modeling",,,,,,,,"<Model-based systems engineering: An emerging approach for modern systems, {eid: 84655170010}>, <Innovations in model-based software and systems engineering, {eid: 85071393498}>, <Privacy challenges for process mining in human-centered industrial environments, {eid: 85057105229}>, <Digitalisierungsansätze ergonomischer analysen und interventionen am beispiel der markerlosen erfassung von körperhaltungen bei arbeitst ätigkeiten in der produktion, {eid: 85016905395}>, <Distance learning and assistance using smart glasses, {eid: 85053395956}>, <Privacy design strategies, {eid: 84926486372}>, <A critical analysis of privacy design strategies, {eid: 85008700680}>, <User-centered and privacy-driven process mining system design for iot, {eid: 85066787588}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a mbse project, {eid: 85071367473}>, <None, {eid: 85066791326}>, <Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Overview and vocabulary, {eid: 84890069861}>, <Privacy aware access control for big data: A research roadmap, {eid: 84947043463}>, <A logic-based framework for attribute based access control, {eid: 20444479906}>, <Adding attributes to role-based access control, {eid: 77953350247}>, <Fine-grained trust assertions for privacy management in the social semantic web, {eid: 84893442329}>, <Blockchain technology in healthcare: The revolution starts here, {eid: 85006489341}>, <Privacy and human behavior in the age of information, {eid: 84921898213}>, <Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (GDPR), {eid: 85013462015}>, <Privacy by design, {eid: 79955131496}>, <None, {eid: 84903651620}>, <Stress-sensitive it-systems at work: Insights from an empirical investigation, {eid: 85068145300}>, <None, {eid: 84952304000}>, <Context modeling for active assistance, {eid: 85035035587}>, <None, {eid: 85125489900}>, <Conceptual modeling for ambient assistance, {eid: 84894148040}>, <Domain specific models as system links, {eid: 85055442265}>, <None, {eid: 84868359117}>, <Environment-integrated human machine interface framework for multimodal system interaction on the shopfloor, {eid: 85049613343}>, <Security, privacy and trust in internet of things: The road ahead, {eid: 84919372488}>, <Security and privacy in the internet of things: Current status and open issues, {eid: 84936802475}>, <On the security and privacy of internet of things architectures and systems, {eid: 84964677884}>, <A security-and quality-aware system architecture for internet of things, {eid: 84908425489}>, <Privacy in the digital age: A review of information privacy research in information systems, {eid: 81355150547}>, <Engineering privacy, {eid: 60449120378}>, <Model-driven approach for privacy management in business ecosystem, {eid: 85044440804}>, <A model driven approach to data privacy verification in e-health systems, {eid: 84949775424}>, <Privacy-preserving process mining: Differential privacy for event logs, {eid: 85070967446}>",,,CEUR-WS,,,9/15/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85072779130

Such systems help reduce complexity for operators by automating data integration tasks and recommending actions. However, these systems are sometimes flawed. It is not sufficiently understood whether, when and why operators comply with such systems in erroneous or correct cases. We empirically investigate compliance with correct and defective DSSs, the influence of correct and erroneous DSS's on performance and subjective factors related to compliance. In the study, a business game was used as an experimental setting in which 40 users took part. The impact of system correctness on user acceptance, trust, compliance and overall performance was investigated. The results show that the defective system reduces trust in automation (−47%), reduces usefulness (−58%), reduces acceptance (−62%) and reduces overall performance (−32%). Overall, the defective system was less user-friendly (−27%). Nevertheless, users who rated the system's usability higher, outperformed users who rated it lower. Usability is therefore an intermediary that compensates for the negative influence of erroneous DSSs.","automation bias, business simulation game, Decision support system, supply chain management, technology acceptance, trust in automation, usability",,,,,,,,"<The Theory of Planned Behavior, {eid: 44949274046, doi: 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}>, <Understanding Age Differences in PDA Acceptance and Performance, {eid: 34249947611, doi: 10.1016/j.chb.2006.06.005}>, <Ironies of Automation, {eid: 0020843464, doi: 10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8}>, <Self-Efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency, {eid: 33746878674, doi: 10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122}>, <Kontrollüberzeugungen im Umgang mit Technik Locus of Control when Interacting with Technology, {eid: 0345388189}>, <The Efficacy of Business Simulation Games in Creating Decision Support Systems: An Experimental Investigation, {eid: 76849117289, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2010.01.002}>, <Measuring the Perceived Effectiveness of Decision Support Systems and their Impact on Performance, {eid: 84868640683, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.033}>, <An Empirically Derived Agenda of Critical Research Issues for Managing Supply-Chain Disruptions, {eid: 27844542118, doi: 10.1080/00207540500151549}>, <The Future of Construction Automation: Technological Disruption and the Upcoming Ubiquity of Robotics, {eid: 84944442053, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.022}>, <None, {eid: 84978863655}>, <None, {eid: 85075090527}>, <A Game-Based Approach to Meet the Challenges of Decision Processes in Ramp-Up Management, {eid: 84958191101, doi: 10.1080/10686967.2016.11918462}>, <None, {eid: 84986277922}>, <None, {eid: 85062367303}>, <None, {eid: 85062329889}>, <How Virtualization, Decentralization and Network Building Change the Manufacturing Landscape: An Industry 4.0 Perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction, {eid: 84948512218, doi: 10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2}>, <Evaluating AmazonS Mechanical Turk as a Tool for Experimental Behavioral Research, {eid: 84874841717, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057410}>, <The New Statistics: Why and How, {eid: 84891940182, doi: 10.1177/0956797613504966}>, <Automated Decision Making Comes of Age, {eid: 23444456914}>, <Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology, {eid: 55249087535, doi: 10.2307/249008}>, <Simulation Games in Engineering Education: A State-of-the-Art Review, {eid: 78149303408, doi: 10.1002/cae.20323}>, <The Effects of Errors on System Trust, Self-Confidence, and the Allocation of Control in Route Planning, {eid: 0038615897, doi: 10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00039-9}>, <None, {eid: 0032689906}>, <None, {eid: 0004278738}>, <Towards Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems in Production Networks, {eid: 84883852241, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2013.05.009}>, <Effects of Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems on Practitioner Performance and Patient Outcomes: A Systematic Review, {eid: 14544305532, doi: 10.1001/jama.293.10.1223}>, <None, {eid: 0003718482}>, <Automation Bias: A systematic Review of Frequency, Effect Mediators, and Mitigators, {eid: 84856788472, doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089}>, <None, {eid: 0003398482}>, <A Framework For Management Information Systems, {eid: 0002959189}>, <Foundations for an Empirically Determined Scale of Trust in Automated System, {eid: 0001803767, doi: 10.1207/S15327566IJCE0401_04}>, <The Role of Human Factors in Agile Supply Chains, {eid: 57349097261, doi: 10.1504/EJIE.2009.021582}>, <On Effect Size, {eid: 84866442229, doi: 10.1037/a0028086}>, <Managing Disruption Risks in Global Supply Chains, {eid: 19844381688, doi: 10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00009.x}>, <None, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect, {eid: 0031108822, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.43.4.546}>, <Trust in Automation: Designing for Appropriate Reliance, {eid: 85010007963, doi: 10.1518/hfes.46.1.50.30392}>, <The Role of Absorptive Capacity, Communication and Trust in ERP Adoption, {eid: 84973925883, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2016.05.025}>, <None, {eid: 85062326574}>, <Cyber-Physical Production Systems: Roots, Expectations and R&D Challenges, {eid: 84904510850, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2014.03.115}>, <Chapter 10: Human Decision Makers and Automated Decision Aids: Made for Each Other?, {eid: 85052397348}>, <Trust in Automation.

This raises a gap between the generic modeling languages and the domains of experience of the engineers using these. Engineering truly domain-specific languages (DSLs) for experts of these domains still is too challenging for their wide-spread adoption. One major obstacle, the inability to reuse multi-dimensional (encapsulating constituents of syntax and semantics) language components in a black-box fashion, prevents the effective engineering of novel DSLs. To facilitate engineering DSLs, we devised a concept of 3D components for textual, external, and translational DSLs that relies on systematic reuse through systematic closed and open variability in which DSL syntaxes can be embedded, well-formedness rules joined, and code generators integrated in a black-box fashion. We present this concept, a method for its systematic application, an integrated collection of modeling languages supporting systematic language reuse, and an extensible framework that leverages these languages to derive novel DSLs from language product lines. These can greatly mitigate many of the challenges in DSL reuse and, hence, can advance the engineering of truly domain-specific modeling languages.","DSL, modeling language, reuse, variability",,,,,,,,"<Feature models, grammars, and propositional formulas, {eid: 33646190894}>, <Functional modelling and simulation of overall system ship-virtual methods for engineering and commissioning in shipbuilding, {eid: 84938682810}>, <None, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Variability management with feature models, {eid: 5144222844}>, <The smach high-level executive, {eid: 78650257169}>, <Controlled and extensible variability of concrete and abstract syntax with independent language features, {eid: 85044388976}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <Systematic composition of independent language features, {eid: 85062348521}>, <Modeling reusable, platform-independent robot assembly processes, {eid: 85071365924}>, <Neverlang 2-componentised language development for the jvm, {eid: 84883342791}>, <Variability within modeling language de?nitions, {eid: 77249172339}>, <Conceptual model of the globalization for domain-speci?c languages, {eid: 84951875201}>, <Concern-oriented language development (cold): Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 84958237938}>, <Mind the gap: Lessons learned from translating grammars between monticore and xtext, {eid: 85077180479}>, <Melange: A meta-language for modular and reusable development of dsls, {eid: 84962587279}>, <Automating generation of the assembly line models in aircraft manufacturing simulation, {eid: 84890853908}>, <Xtext-implement your language faster than the quick and dirty way, {eid: 78650158701}>, <Towards e?ective management of inconsistencies in model-based engineering of automated production systems, {eid: 84953867216}>, <None, {eid: 85052020111}>, <The aadl behaviour annex-experiments and roadmap, {eid: 44149092088}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <Using state machines for a model driven development of web service-based sensor network applications, {eid: 77955827775}>, <A comparison of mechanisms for integrating handwritten and generated code for object-oriented programming languages, {eid: 84939532216}>, <None, {eid: 50949102921}>, <Meaningful modeling: Whats the semantics of ""semantics""?, {eid: 7244261750}>, <Integrating ocl and textual modelling languages, {eid: 79957644161}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Software language engineering in the large: Towards composing and deriving languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <Semantic virtual factory supporting interoperable modelling and evaluation of production systems, {eid: 84878842766}>, <Vcu: The three dimensions of reuse, {eid: 84977507448}>, <None, {eid: 67649962577}>, <Choosy and picky: Con?guration of language product lines, {eid: 84982855913}>, <Technological spaces: An initial appraisal, {eid: 18144421716}>, <None, {eid: 84919732308}>, <Feature-oriented language families: A case study, {eid: 84921051501}>, <Gramosa framework for graphical modelling and simulation-based analysis of complex production processes, {eid: 84942371630}>, <None, {eid: 85096984750}>, <None, {eid: 84949846008}>, <Model-based design process for the early phases of manufacturing system planning using sysml, {eid: 85019992214}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Abstract features in feature modeling, {eid: 80054080510}>, <Metaedit+: De?ning and using integrated domain-speci?c modeling languages, {eid: 72249095680}>, <Neverlang: A framework for feature-oriented language development, {eid: 84938739142}>, <Language modularization and composition with projectional language workbenches illustrated with mps, {eid: 81455159767}>, <Language extension and composition with language workbenches, {eid: 78650085881}>, <Language design with the spoofax language workbench, {eid: 84907989410}>, <Improving domain-speci?c language reuse with software product line techniques, {eid: 67650445765}>, <Modeling languages in industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>, <Domain-speci?c metamodelling languages for software language engineering, {eid: 77951542786}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,10/18/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096955321

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud/edge computing integration. This work sets out to be a guide to the status of DT development and application in today’s academic and industrial environment.","Business model, Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Product lifecycle management, Review",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.051}>, <PSS business model conceptualization and application, {eid: 85027857673, doi: 10.1080/09537287.2017.1363924}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.10.003}>, <Cyber-physical system framework for measurement and analysis of physical activities, {eid: 85063520336, doi: 10.3390/electronics8020248}>, <Sustainable and flexible industrial human machine interfaces to support adaptable applications in the Industry 4.0 paradigm, {eid: 85061078981, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1572932}>, <Business models as models, {eid: 77952564431, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.02.005}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1526324}>, <Warehouse management system customization and information availability in 3pl companies: A decision-support tool, {eid: 85053068565, doi: 10.1108/imds-01-2018-0033}>, <Radial basis functions update of digital models on actual manufactured shapes, {eid: 85059948011, doi: 10.1115/1.4041680}>, <Digital twin driven human–robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2019.04.011}>, <Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291, doi: 10.1108/josm-04-2018-0113}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Digital Twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524, doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00031}>, <Digital twins to enhance the integration of ergonomics in the workplace design, {eid: 85061523003, doi: 10.1016/j.ergon.2019.02.001}>, <From strategy to business models and onto tactics, {eid: 77952561844, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.01.004}>, <A supervised machine learning approach to data-driven simulation of resilient supplier selection in digital manufacturing, {eid: 85063342587, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.03.004}>, <Cyber-physical integration for moving digital factories forward towards smart manufacturing: a survey, {eid: 85045842061, doi: 10.1007/s00170-018-2001-2}>, <Cyber-physical systems: A case study of development for manufacturing industry, {eid: 85028566642, doi: 10.1504/ijcat.2017.10006845}>, <The relation between systematic reviews and practice guidelines methods for developing guidelines: An overview, {eid: 0030761938, doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-127-3-199708010-00006}>, <Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling, {eid: 85067817812, doi: 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.05.045}>, <Part data integration in the shop floor digital twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.02.002}>, <An open source approach to the design and implementation of digital twins for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85064532610, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2019.1599436}>, <Meet Virtual Singapore, the city’s 3D digital twin, {eid: 85086996479}>, <Emergence of digital twins - is this the march of reason?, {eid: 85048741165, doi: 10.24840/2183-0606_005.003_0003}>, <Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance, {eid: 84869487494, doi: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037}>, <Digital twins probe into food cooling and biochemical quality changes for reducing losses in refrigerated supply chains, {eid: 85070210024, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.002}>, <Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites, {eid: 85052228223, doi: 10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.08.024}>, <BIOSOARM: A bio-inspired self-organising architecture for manufacturing cyber-physical shopfloors, {eid: 84986268581, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1258-2}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1566661}>, <Ergonomic rationalization of lighting in the working environment.

There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.","Digital Twin, Virtual

All rights reserved.This paper presents our approach to create an executable prototype of an enterprise information system based only on a data structure model. This prototype, which is still easily adaptable and extendable, can be used for analysis exploration and builds a solid foundation for the final system. The presented approach transforms a data structure model to changeable and extendable graphical user interface models. In a second step, the data structure model and the GUI models are used to generate the resulting system. This approach allows the developer to generate (a) persistence, (b) basic application logic, (c) transportation layers, and (d) a variety of possible graphical representations for the prototype based only on a data structure model. Extensions and changes of the GUI are still possible on model and code level. This is possible by synthetization of GUI models and change operations defined in the same domain-specific language.","Domain-Specific Languages, Generative Software Engineering, Graphical User Interfaces, Model-Driven Software Engineering, MontiGEM",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85097718458}>, <Model-Based Generation of Enterprise Information Systems, {eid: 85048362638}>, <A rails/django comparison, {eid: 80052282664}>, <Ruby on Rails, {eid: 36348991909}>, <UMLtoGraphDB: Mapping Conceptual Schemas to Graph Databases, {eid: 84997418634}>, <Model Based Rapid Prototyping and Evolution of Web Application, {eid: 85047993715}>, <Generated Enterprise Information Systems: MDSE for Maintainable Co-Development of Frontend and Backend, {eid: 85080937709}>, <Comparison of two model driven architecture approaches for automating business processes, Moskitt Framework and Bizagi Process Management Suite, {eid: 84924235705}>, <Engineering Tagging Languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Modeling variants of automotive systems using views, {eid: 84873324699}>, <Integration of Heterogeneous Modeling Languages via Extensible and Composable Language Components, {eid: 84939549902}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Automatic Source Code Generation for Web-based Process-oriented Information Systems, {eid: 85025475389}>, <Applying a Generative Technique for Enhanced Genericity and Maintainability on the J2EE Platform.

In Europe, even the legal concept of data ownership is unclear. We reflect on requirements analyses, reference architectures and solution concepts pursued by the International Data Spaces Initiative to address these issues. The second part will more deeply explore our current interdisciplinary research in a visionary “Internet of Production” with 27 research groups from production and materials engineering, computer science, business and social sciences. In this setting, massive amounts of heterogeneous data must be exchanged and analyzed across organizational and disciplinary boundaries, throughout the lifecycle from (re-)engineering, to production, usage and recycling, under hard resource and time constraints. A shared metaphor, borrowed from Plato’s famous Cave Allegory, serves as the core modeling and data management approach from conceptual, logical, physical, and business perspectives.","Data sovereignty, Data spaces, Digital shadows, Internet of Production",,,,,,,,"<Product oriented integration of heterogeneous mobility services, {eid: 84937130548}>, <Data ecosystems–sovereign data exchange among organizations, {eid: 85107616537}>, <Model-driven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85129989625}>, <Usage control in the industrial data space, {eid: 85074817575}>, <Continuous requirements management for organization networks – a (Dis-)trustful approach, {eid: 26944484554}>, <Bridging different perspectives on technological platforms—towards and integrative framework, {eid: 84902550958}>, <FactDAG – formalizing data interoperability in an internet of production, {eid: 85083740453}>, <Relaxed functional dependency discovery in heterogeneous data lakes, {eid: 85076141961}>, <Principles of data space systems, {eid: 34250660624}>, <Data spaces: Combining goal-driven and data-driven approaches in community decision and negotiation support, {eid: 85028346174}>, <The brave new world of design requirements, {eid: 79958086098}>, <On warehouses, lakes, and spaces – the changing role of conceptual modeling for data integration, {eid: 85051091635}>, <Information systems engineering with digital shadows – concept and case studies, {eid: 85086264603}>, <Requirements engineering for cyber physical production systems, {eid: 85067369691}>, <Designing a multi-sided data platform: Findings from the international data spaces case, {eid: 85072032697}>, <None, {eid: 85020490036}>, <Service-oriented business model framework – a service-dominant logic based approach for business modeling in the digital era, {eid: 85023194756}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <None, {eid: 85086269804}>, <Distributed usage control, {eid: 33748543201}>, <Platform evolution – co-evolution of platform architecture, governance, and environmental dynamics, {eid: 78650659690}>, <Process Mining – Discovery, Conformance, and Enhancement of Business Processes, {eid: 79955792399}>, <The new organizing logic of digital innovation – an agenda for information systems research, {eid: 78650630327}>, <Modeling strategic relationships for process reengineering, {eid: 80052800851}>",,,Springer,,,6/8/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85086271667

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

However, securely setting up OPC UA, the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate configuration for security-featuring protocols.","industrial communication, network security, security configuration",,,,,,,,"<Mission accomplished?

A service oriented production architecture can enable this goal. However, it demands changes in the software-based systems that compose the different levels of automation in a factory. Additionally, it requires a multitude of data to reflect the demands of service-oriented manufacturing processes. In this paper, we detail the minimal data to be contained in digital twins to enable an Industry 4.0 service-oriented architecture. We use two central Industry 4.0 use cases as drivers for deriving this data. We describe services by detailing their capabilities and their quality of service in terms of time, money and resulting product quality. Using these descriptions, we detail customer’s order and the included product to be manufactured. Additionally, we describe challenges of the orchestration process like incompleteness of business processes and detail, how they can be solved using digital twins of the product, the service providers and the plant. Finally, we validate the proposed models by implementing the use cases on two model plants and give an experience report.","Asset Administration Shell, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Service-based production, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Service-oriented paradigms in industrial automation, {eid: 17444427689}>, <None, {eid: 0004081350}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <None, {eid: 85091535231}>, <None, {eid: 85059292185}>, <None, {eid: 0003711260}>, <Turning software into a service, {eid: 0142091714}>, <Service-oriented architecture, {eid: 4644319922}>, <None, {eid: 11144327305}>, <A unifying semantics for sequential function charts, {eid: 33847187319}>, <Software engineering in industrial automation: state-of-the-art review, {eid: 84883037727}>, <Industrial internet reference architecture, {eid: 84952899781}>, <None, {eid: 85091515062}>, <The Stuttgart IT architecture for manufacturing, {eid: 85025142333}>, <Implementing smart factory of Industrie 4.0: an outlook, {eid: 84958581089}>, <Challenges in the engineering of adaptable and flexible industrial factories, {eid: 85044385954}>, <None, {eid: 0003063517}>, <None, {eid: 85091504721}>, <None, {eid: 85091482237}>, <Industrie 4.0 virtual automation bus, {eid: 85091521284}>, <Towards a semantic administrative shell for industry 4.0 components, {eid: 84968909041}>, <Factory of the future: a service-oriented system of modular, dynamic reconfigurable and collaborative systems, {eid: 85151551291}>, <A SOA-based architecture for empowering future collaborative cloud-based industrial automation, {eid: 84872933340}>, <Examples of the Asset Administration Shell for Industrie 4.0 Components–Basic Part, {eid: 85062688797}>, <Orchestration of service-oriented manufacturing processes, {eid: 33847276520}>, <Service-oriented device communications using the devices profile for web services, {eid: 50349085799}>, <Service-orientation and flexible service binding in distributed automation and control systems, {eid: 50249084996}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: an IoT-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <Loosely-coupled automation systems using device-level SOA, {eid: 39749199109}>, <Making system of systems interoperable–the core components of the arrowhead framework, {eid: 84994852297}>, <Embedded-software architects: it’s not only about the software, {eid: 84994408854}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85091500311

While hundreds of isolated solutions exist to utilize these data, e.g., optimizing processes or monitoring machine conditions, the lack of a unified data handling and exchange mechanism hinders the implementation of approaches to improve the quality of decisions and processes in such an interconnected environment. The vision of an Internet of Production promises the establishment of a Worldwide Lab, where data from every process in the network can be utilized, even interorganizational and across domains. While numerous existing approaches consider interoperability from an interface and communication system perspective, fundamental questions of data and information interoperability remain insufficiently addressed. In this article, we identify ten key issues, derived from three distinctive real-world use cases that hinder large-scale data interoperability for industrial processes. Based on these issues, we derive a set of five key requirements for future (IoT) data layers, building upon the FAIR data principles. We propose to address them by creating FactDAG, a conceptual data layer model for maintaining a provenance-based, directed acyclic graph of facts, inspired by successful distributed version-control and collaboration systems. Eventually, such a standardization should greatly shape the future of interoperability in an interconnected production industry.","Data management, data versioning, Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), interoperability, Worldwide Lab (WWL)",,,,,,,,"<Industrial Internet of Things and cyber manufacturing systems, {eid: 85002143570, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-42559-7-1}>, <Acyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <IoTplatforms for the Internet of production, {eid: 85054607819}>, <The rise of big Dataon cloud computing: Review and open research issues, {eid: 84907325157}>, <Acase for integrated Data processing in Large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85070870764}>, <Industrie 4.0-Advanced engineering of smart products and smart production, {eid: 84955457957}>, <Designing and implementing cross-sector collaborations: Needed and challenging, {eid: 84940439992}>, <Supply chain collaboration: Astate-of-The-Art Literature review, {eid: 85030173815}>, <Industrial Internet of Things: Challenges, opportunities, and Directions, {eid: 85049358359}>, <Dataflow challenges in an Internet of production: Asecurity & privacy perspective, {eid: 85075014511}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the Internet of production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <None, {eid: 85046784387}>, <None, {eid: 77954051808}>, <The internet of things: Asurvey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <Enabling IoTecosystems through platform interoperability, {eid: 85010468529}>, <Interoperability for industrial cyber-physical systems: An approach for Legacy systems, {eid: 85028505206}>, <Amodular interoperability Layer for connecting the business and manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050033063}>, <Enabling IoTplatform interoperability using a systematic Development approach by example, {eid: 85059081352}>, <Semantic interoperability in industry 4.0: Survey of recent Developments and outlook, {eid: 85055539075}>, <OMGData-distribution service: Architectural overview, {eid: 79251639232}>, <Improving machine tool interoperability using standardized interface protocols: MTconnect, {eid: 77955553954}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <None, {eid: 85007218223}>, <Measuring tool chain interoperability in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84985987164}>, <EXPRESS: AData extraction, processing, and restructuring system, {eid: 84976700402}>, <Asurvey of extract-Transform-load technology, {eid: 70349388050}>, <None, {eid: 79956288646}>, <State-of-The-Art and future challenge in fine-blanking technology, {eid: 85048279177}>, <Dependencies of the Die-roll height During fine blanking of case hardening steel 16MnCr5 without V-ring using a nesting strategy, {eid: 85037145302}>, <Influence of scattering material properties on the robustness of Deep Drawing processes, {eid: 85054251197}>, <Stamping process modelling in an Internet of production, {eid: 85076105638}>, <Process-parallel Virtual quality evaluation for metal cutting in series production, {eid: 85052855345}>, <Control from the cloud: Edge computing, services and Digital shadow for automation technologies, {eid: 85071422816}>, <Named graphs, provenance and trust, {eid: 27344444574}>, <Data provenance in SOA: Security, reliability, and integrity, {eid: 36749051012}>, <Looking ahead in pervasive computing: Challenges and opportunities in the era of cyber-physical convergence, {eid: 80255136670}>, <If we share Data, will anyone use them?

By mobilization of multipurpose resources and dynamic planning, Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems (LMASs) offer organizational reconfigurability. By proposing a holarchy to combine LMASs with the concept of an Internet of Production (IoP), we enable LMASs to source valuable information from cross-level production networks, physical resources, software nodes, and data stores that are interconnected in an IoP. The presented holarchy provides a concept of how to address future challenges, meet the requirements of shorter lead times, and unique lifecycle support. The paper suggests an application of decision making, distributed sensor services, recommender-based data reduction, and in-network computing while considering safety and human usability alike.","Industrial assembly, Internet of Production, Line-less Mobile Assembly System, Smart factory",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 33749989322}>, <Towards an Infrastructure Enabling Internet of Production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <Adaptation of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems for Industrial Assembly-Review of Flexibility Paradigms, Concepts, and Outlook, {eid: 84992549254}>, <Multi-Staged, Multi-Objective Optimization for Operation Management in Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems (LMAS), {eid: 85092435978}>, <Assessment of IS Integration Eff-orts to Implement the Internet of Production Reference Architecture, {eid: 85053759975}>, <None, {eid: 85080691753}>, <The industrial internet of things: An analysis framework, {eid: 85047947260}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Digital Shadows in the Internet of Production, {eid: 85074214541}>, <The Digital Shadow as Enabler for Data Analytics in PLM, {eid: 85067176432}>, <Control from the Cloud: Edge Computing, Services and Digital Shadow for Automation Technologies, {eid: 85071422816}>, <Requirements for the Design of Flexible and Changeable Manufacturing and Assembly Systems: A SME-survey, {eid: 84968835322}>, <Transformability: Key factor for future factories, {eid: 0012592812}>, <A Review on Manufacturing Flexibility, {eid: 77949810686}>, <The Management of Manufacturing Flexibility, {eid: 84968118669}>, <Integrative selbstoptimierende Prozessketten, {eid: 85106430488}>, <Assignment, Sequencing and Location Planning in Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems, {eid: 85092434146}>, <Modelling and Assessing Line-less Mobile Assembly Systems, {eid: 85068461888}>, <Scanning the Industry 4.0, {eid: 85060756114}>, <Comparison of emerging manufacturing concepts, {eid: 0032272888}>, <Fog/Edge Computing-Based IoT (FECIoT), {eid: 85054696546}>, <IoTDoc: A Docker-Container Based Architecture of IoT-Enabled Cloud System, {eid: 85070622037}>, <Optimization and deployment of CNNs at the edge, {eid: 85066029325}>, <FactDAG: Formalizing Data Interoperability in an Internet of Production, {eid: 85083740453}>, <In-Network Computation is a Dumb Idea Whose Time Has Come, {eid: 85041220007}>, <On Warehouses, Lakes, and Spaces: The Changing Role of Conceptual Modeling for Data Integration, {eid: 85051091635}>, <Dataflow Challenges in an Internet of Production, {eid: 85075014511}>, <Model-based interfacing of large-scale metrology instruments, {eid: 85106399580}>, <Artifact-free coordinate registration of heterogeneous Large-Scale Metrology systems, {eid: 85065591925}>, <Sensor information as a service-component of networked production, {eid: 85047360163}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,7/15/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85106412122

It is a challenge to create an adaptive, unobtrusive system with high accuracy of supporting actions. Previous work assumes that either a concrete goal is preset for a whole support application, or is chosen from a finite set of goals by the user or is calculated over a finite set of goals by heuristic algorithms. This novel directions paper discusses ideas to reduce the solution space for assistive systems by using observations of human behavior together with domain-specific and general knowledge. We discuss especially challenges for creating goal models, how to combine them with other existing models, and how to use them in model-based software engineering approaches with automatic code generation. A concrete realization of these ideas enables a variety of design decisions regarding modeling languages, the interplay of different languages, and how to handle goals at run-time.","Assistive Systems, Behavior Goals, Goal Modeling, Model-Driven Software Engineering",,,,,,,,"<Model-Based Generation of Enterprise Information Systems, {eid: 85048362638}>, <Enterprise Information Systems in Academia and Practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE Project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <Behavior Modeling and Reasoning for Ambient Support: HCM-L Modeler, {eid: 85094193466}>, <Goal-based requirements analysis, {eid: 0029707819}>, <Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches, {eid: 0028401306}>, <GORO 2.0: Evolving an Ontology for Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, {eid: 85094213491}>, <MEMO GoalML: A Context-Enriched Modeling Language to Support Reflective Organizational Goal Planning and Decision Processes, {eid: 84997294424}>, <Goal Representation for BDI Agent Systems, {eid: 26444590427}>, <Modeling the user’s plans and goals, {eid: 84936204801}>, <Integrating exception handling in goal models, {eid: 84909982794}>, <Goal-directed requirements acquisition, {eid: 0027574423}>, <Motivational beliefs, values, and goals, {eid: 0036407793}>, <A Modeling Ontology for Integrating Vulnerabilities into Security Requirements Conceptual Foundations, {eid: 77954833995}>, <From event logs to goals: a systematic literature review of goal-oriented process mining, {eid: 85059740814}>, <Generated Enterprise Information Systems: MDSE for Maintainable Co-Development of Frontend and Backend, {eid: 85080937709}>, <A Systematic Literature Review of iStar extensions, {eid: 85034790900}>, <Engineering Tagging Languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Modeling Robot and World Interfaces for Reusable Tasks, {eid: 84958162708}>, <Creativity and Goal Modeling for Software Requirements Engineering, {eid: 84962071137}>, <Using Goal Models Downstream, {eid: 84927511642}>, <Interactive Goal Model Analysis for Early Requirements Engineering, {eid: 85027948067}>, <Activity theory: implications for human-computer interaction, {eid: 0040860784}>, <Goal Modeling in Requirements Engineering, {eid: 33751567345}>, <Using EEML for Combined Goal and Process Oriented Modeling: Evaluation through a Case Study, {eid: 85094191976}>, <Zuhoor: Mapping from MAP Models to BPMN Processes, {eid: 84904690175}>, <None, {eid: 84907286102}>, <A model for notification systems evaluation—assessing user goals for multitasking activity, {eid: 3042734130}>, <Representing and using nonfunctional requirements: a process-oriented approach, {eid: 0026883734}>, <The HBMS Story - Past and Future of an Active Assistance Approach, {eid: 85055426220}>, <Conceptual Modeling for Ambient Assistance, {eid: 84894148040}>, <Context Modeling for Active Assistance, {eid: 85035035587}>, <Using Goals to Identify Aspects in Business Process Models, {eid: 79955148652}>, <A language for multi-perspective goal modelling: Challenges, requirements and solutions, {eid: 84913529033}>, <A review on applications of activity recognition systems with regard to performance and evaluation, {eid: 84985994140}>, <Modeling Goals and Reasoning with Them, {eid: 33846562267}>, <Using Semantic Markup to Boost Context Awareness for Assistive Systems, {eid: 85071393161}>, <Modeling Personalized Adaptive Systems, {eid: 84879849668}>, <An Actor Dependency Model of Organizational Work: With Application to Business Process Reengineering, {eid: 0027830216}>",,,CEUR-WS,,,5/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85094179134

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Injection molding, Model-driven development, Reference architecture",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Digital behavioral twins for safe connected cars, {eid: 85056832496}>, <Machinability assessment of inconel 718 by factorial design of experiment coupled with response surface methodology, {eid: 0343168164}>, <Practical applications of Taguchi method for optimization of processing parameters for plastic injection moulding: A retrospective review, {eid: 84923316802}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Constance: an intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <Injection molding setup by means of machine learning based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85072959161}>, <Combined learning processes for injection moulding based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85097342280}>, <Flexibilisation of injection moulding manufacture through digitisation, {eid: 85086233825}>, <Approaches of self-optimising systems in manufacturing, {eid: 85149036760}>, <None, {eid: 85086227181}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85054903830}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <None, {eid: 84905811248}>, <Abstraction and refinement in hierarchically decomposable and underspecified CPS-architectures, {eid: 85052702289}>, <Jenseits menschlicher fähigkeiten.

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.","cyber-physical systems, digital twins, information systems, model-driven software engineering, software architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85096954089}>, <None, {eid: 85085475406}>, <None,

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELS’17), IEEE, pp 281–291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.","Industry 4.0, Modeling languages, Smart

There is large consensus on the fact that work will change and different skills will be needed. However, whether the organization of work will evolve towards higher responsibility and decision-making of the employees or towards higher technological control is still an open question. The challenge is how to govern this evolution and purposely guide the process of integrating people within CPSs in order to move towards the desired scenario. This paper addresses this challenge, by proposing a methodology to support the design and assessment of different work configurations, jointly considering the uniqueness of human labour and the characteristics of cyber-physical production within a comprehensive framework. The method covers ordinary production as well as irregular scenarios, such as failure detection or maintenance intervention, particularly interesting for human work. The applicability of the method is illustrated through two industrial cases, leading to suggestions for training the personnel and for enhancing the whole cyber- physical-social system. Results include human-centric Key Performance indicators (KPIs) and general guidelines for work design. The approach encourages managers and engineers to clarify their strategy for human resources; develops a multi-perspective awareness on the role of workers; fosters an early detection of possible misalignment between the high-level strategies and the technical interventions on the shop floor. The modelling, analysis and assessment technique developed aims at representing a first step towards formal and quantitative methods to support the design of human work integrated within cyber-physical-systems.","Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Human-centric KPIs, Human-centric manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Modelling and simulation, Work design",,,,,,,,"<Trusted autonomy and cognitive cyber symbiosis: Open challenges, {eid: 84951817439, doi: 10.1007/s12559-015-9365-5}>, <The skill content of recent technological change: An empirical exploration, {eid: 0345016471, doi: 10.3386/w8337}>, <Artificial cognition in production systems, {eid: 78651075251, doi: 10.1109/TASE.2010.2053534}>, <Real-time personal protective equipment monitoring system, {eid: 84869085980, doi: 10.1016/j.comcom.2012.01.005}>, <Did the Computer Revolution shift the fortunes of U.S. cities?

Besides the technical implementation, aspects such as lacking trust, unclear benefits for suppliers and different perceptions of Industry 4.0 hamper digital information sharing, especially by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In response, this paper investigates social capital and further influential factors as prerequisites for information sharing between buyers and suppliers in the context of Industry 4.0. Further, the paper aims to find the targets that suppliers pursue in digital information sharing, presenting possible incentives that could be provided by their customers. Regional and data-specific differences shall further be uncovered. The research model developed is based on established constructs and was further refined by integrating the expert knowledge of an industrial enterprise regarded. A structural equation model is tested with empirical data, collected from a final sample of 957 of its suppliers worldwide. Among others, the paper uncovers that digital information sharing for German suppliers shows high correlations with social interaction, trust, and benefit sharing. Further, several targets are identified that suppliers pursue by digital information sharing, for instance showing particularly high correlations for suppliers from China and Southern Europe. Among different data types, trust is especially important for sharing production and process data.

Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.","Bloom filter, Internet of Production, oblivious transfer, secure industrial collaboration",,,,,,,,"<Optimization of injection molding process parameters by a hybrid of artificial neural network and artificial bee colony algorithm, {eid: 84884569132}>, <More efficient oblivious transfer and extensions for faster secure computation, {eid: 84889059259}>, <Correlated pseudorandomness and the complexity of private computations, {eid: 0029702967}>, <Cython: The best of both worlds, {eid: 79952600759}>, <State of the internet report - Q1 2017 report.

While adaptability is vastly increased, these more dynamic associations necessitate more extensive data sharing among different stakeholders while simultaneously overturning previously established levels of trust. Hence, manufacturers' demand to track goods and to investigate root causes of issues across their supply chains becomes more challenging to satisfy within these now untrusted environments. Complementarily, suppliers need to keep any data irrelevant to such routine checks secret to remain competitive. To bridge the needs of contractors and suppliers in increasingly flexible supply chains, we thus propose to establish a privacy-preserving and distributed multi-hop accountability log among the involved stakeholders based on Attribute-based Encryption and backed by a blockchain. Our large-scale feasibility study is motivated by a real-world manufacturing process, i.e., a fine blanking line, and reveals only modest costs for multi-hop tracing and tracking of goods.","Attribute-based encryption, Blockchain, Internet of Production, Multi-hop tracking and tracing, Supply chain",,,,,,,,"<The impact of supply chain integration on performance: A contingency and configuration approach, {eid: 71349087209}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85075007871}>, <Dataflow challenges in an internet of production: A security & privacy perspective, {eid: 85075014511}>, <Security considerations for collaborations in an industrial iot-based lab of labs, {eid: 85083694152}>, <A journey in applying blockchain for cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85082175369}>, <The collaborative supply chain, {eid: 84992930161}>, <Information sharing as a coordination mechanism for reducing the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, {eid: 34247280386}>, <Building successful logistics partnerships, {eid: 0012566419}>, <Collaborative supply chain management: The most promising practice for building efficient and sustainable supply chains, {eid: 34249789030}>, <Digital supply chain transformation toward blockchain integration, {eid: 85061159764}>, <Blockchain in logistics and supply chain: Trick or treat?, {eid: 85044348960}>, <Do you need a blockchain?, {eid: 85058290284}>, <Productchain: Scalable blockchain framework to support provenance in supply chains, {eid: 85113258875}>, <Trustchain: Trust management in blockchain and iot supported supply chains, {eid: 85078703339}>, <Blockchain ready manufacturing supply chain using distributed ledger, {eid: 85028593103}>, <Toward an ontology-driven blockchain design for supply-chain provenance, {eid: 85044518392}>, <Blockchain-based supply chain traceability: Token recipes model manufacturing processes, {eid: 85067872571}>, <Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84857214669}>, <Decentralizing attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84864536476}>, <Cryptographic cloud storage, {eid: 84988890715}>, <Towards secure mobile cloud computing: A survey, {eid: 84866668858}>, <Easier: Encryption-based access control in social networks with efficient revocation, {eid: 84863649032}>, <Security and privacy in smart health: Efficient policy-hiding attribute-based access control, {eid: 85045344537}>, <Smart contract-based car insurance policies, {eid: 85076109663}>, <Adaptable key-policy attribute-based encryption with time interval, {eid: 84975129943}>, <Charm: A framework for rapidly prototyping cryptosystems, {eid: 84881234170}>, <None, {eid: 85090266623}>, <None, {eid: 85071622151}>, <None, {eid: 85075916236}>, <None, {eid: 85070610572}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <None, {eid: 2342639859}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85090159235

This paper aims to identify perspectives, principles and prospects of production logistics visibility (PLV). The study is based on a literature review of articles presenting definitions, development trends and the future role of PLV. It is concluded that visibility is generally defined by availability, quality, accessibility and usefulness of information. PLV could refer to the extent to which actors within the production systems have access to timely and accurate information considered useful to their operations. According to the findings, antecedents of PLV include digitalisation, IoT and connectivity. These steps are required to turn data into meaningful information that can be used for decision making in production and logistics setting to improve operational and business performance. Furthermore, to fully benefit from PLV, there has to be an integration of external and internal perspectives. Concluding, the paper defines future research efforts including four lines of exploration and development: (1) Intra-site visibility for material management including dynamic synchronisation, takt and resource planning. (2) Supply-oriented visibility for dynamic status and prediction of supply network status. These two initial lines of enquiry should include the perspectives of stakeholders, parameter, enabling technologies and potential impact. (3) A synthesised framework for Production Logistics Visibility, relying on utilizing antecedents and enabling multi-criteria decision in production logistics based on visibility, where performance in terms of efficiency, sustainability and flexibility is ensured. (4) To specifically detail and exploit the potential in production logistics visibility in the aspect of environmental sustainability and closed material and product loops.","Digitalization, Production logistics, Supply Chain, Visibility",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85182103068}>, <Digital supply chain transformation: Visualizing the possibilities, {eid: 85098647439}>, <Conducting a literature review, {eid: 84993029626}>, <None, {eid: 85182109660}>, <CIRP Nomenclature and Definitions for Manufacturing Systems (English Language Version), {eid: 0347367819}>, <Exploring internal and external supply chain linkages: Evidence from the field, {eid: 79955068420}>, <Leveraging supply chain visibility for responsiveness: The moderating role of internal integration, {eid: 84887009587}>, <Supply chain practice and information sharing, {eid: 34547682716}>, <Managing product quality risk and visibility in multi-layer supply chain, {eid: 84863186409}>, <Information-sharing in supply chains: Five proposals on how to proceed, {eid: 84986156114}>, <Defining and assessing requisite supply chain visibility in regulated industries, {eid: 84877825051}>, <An empirical investigation of supply chain strategy typologies and relationships to performance, {eid: 51749125229}>, <Information visibility non differentiated products, {eid: 0036489962}>, <Improving supply chain performance through improved visibility, {eid: 84986105967}>, <Performance measurement in a supply chain, {eid: 0038046206}>, <The effect of controversial global sourcing practices on ethical judgements and intentions of US consumers, {eid: 84939944218}>, <The value of sharing planning information in supply chains, {eid: 84878249883}>, <Antecedents of supply chain visibility in retail supply chains: A resource-based theory perspective, {eid: 34548713468}>, <None, {eid: 84982208424}>, <Improving supply chain visibility using iot-internet of things, {eid: 85063897267}>, <A Hybrid Blockchain Ledger for Supply Chain Visibility, {eid: 85053935830}>, <None, {eid: 85063867101}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility and supply chain performance, {eid: 84897115235}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility in buyer-supplier relationshps: The case of telecommunication equipment component manufacturing industry, {eid: 79953161073}>, <Supply chain visibility: A decision making perspective, {eid: 70349320049}>, <The benefits of supply chain visibility: A value assessment model, {eid: 84896361906}>, <An investigation of visibility and flexibility as complements to supply chain analytics: An organizational information processing theory perspective, {eid: 85026783047}>, <Characterizing supply chain visibility-A literature review, {eid: 85042486901}>, <Does supply chain visibility affect operating performance?-Evidence from conflict minerals disclosures, {eid: 85064002720}>, <Sustainability-related supply chain risks: Conceptualization and management, {eid: 84896395922}>, <Extending the supply chain visibility boundry, Utilizing stakeholders for identifying supply chain sustainability risks, {eid: 85009446793}>, <Role-Tailored map dashboards-A new approach for enhancing the forest-based supply chain, {eid: 85061348901}>, <None, {eid: 85084767126}>",,,IOS Press BV,,,10/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85098635883

However, in case of sudden changes in the operational area, such as unexpected obstacles or humans, robots have to be continuously monitored by powerful controllers for swift interventions (i.e., send emergency stop signals). As in the case of many verticals (e.g., transportation, shopping), the proliferation of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has started to captivate industry 4.0 as well in order to benefit from low infrastructure costs, and flexible management and resource provisioning. Besides all the advantages of the centralized approach, however, in critical situations (e.g., possible collisions, actuator damages or human injuries) the required ultra-low latency between the robots and the controller becomes an all-important factor, and one of the main concerns, at the same time, for industry leaders making the decision towards this paradigm shift. In this paper, we argue that by relying on recently emerged stateful and programmable data planes, it is possible to fill this gap by offloading latency-critical applications to the network, thereby bringing some intelligence much closer the robots. We present the first in-network robotic control application that is capable to intercept the communication between the robot and the controller and craft responses immediately if needed. In particular, we show that we can detect position threshold violations entirely in the data plane, close to the robot, and deliver emergency stop commands within no time with full compliance to the actual TCP session and application states.","Low Latency applications, P4, Robotic control",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4. 0: Towards future industrial opportunities and challenges, {eid: 84966558951}>, <Silkroad: Making stateful layer-4 load balancing fast and cheap using switching asics, {eid: 85029443821}>, <Heavy-hitter detection entirely in the data plane, {eid: 85018957154}>, <Offloading real-time ddos attack detection to programmable data planes, {eid: 85067068832}>, <In-network p4-based low latency robot arm control, {eid: 85077959040}>, <P4: Programming protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <Innetwork computation is a dumb idea whose time has come, {eid: 85041220007}>, <Towards in-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <Towards executing computer vision functionality on programmable network devices, {eid: 85078956735}>, <Towards human-robot collaboration: An industry 4. 0 vr platform with clouds under the hood, {eid: 85091973407}>, <Mobile edge computing a key technology towards 5g, {eid: 84963757817}>, <None, {eid: 85091988639}>, <TCP veto: A novel network attack and its application to scada protocols, {eid: 84876943601}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/29/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85091982375

Due to resource limitations, mainly in network bandwidth, data scientists need to reduce the data collected from machines. The amount of data can currently be reduced in breadth (number of values) or depth (frequency/precision of values), which both reduce the quality of subsequent analysis. In this paper, we propose an optimized data load via process-driven data collection. With our method, data providers can (i) split their production process into phases, (ii) for each phase precisely define what data to collect and how, and (iii) model transitions between phases via a data-driven method. This approach allows a complete focus on a certain part of the available machine data during one process phase, and a completely different focus in phases with different characteristics.

We propose a conceptual model to describe digital shadows, data structures tailored to exploit models and data in smart manufacturing, through a metamodel and its notion space. This conceptual model was established through interdisciplinary research in the German excellence cluster “Internet of Production” and evaluated in various real-world manufacturing scenarios. This foundation for an understanding helps to manage complexity, automated analyses, and syntheses, and, ultimately, facilitates cross-domain collaboration.","Conceptual model, Digital shadow, Internet of production, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85118185901}>, <None, {eid: 85118182187}>, <None, {eid: 85102731930}>, <A generalized data meta-model for production companies ontology definition, {eid: 79959666549}>, <None, {eid: 85098244055}>, <None, {eid: 85118125482}>, <Development of efficient high-fidelity solutions for virtual fatigue testing, {eid: 85071877419}>, <None, {eid: 84872247517}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with MT connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <A knowledge-based digital shadow for machining industry in a digital twin perspective, {eid: 85089084575}>, <Digital twin concept for smart injection molding, {eid: 85046263291}>, <None, {eid: 85102731930}>, <None, {eid: 85111407304}>, <Digital twin for CNC machine tool: Modeling and using strategy, {eid: 85050765931}>, <The triptych of conceptual modeling, {eid: 85096851500}>, <Virtual reality applications in manufacturing process simulation, {eid: 10044285235}>, <A framework for model-driven engineering of resilient software-controlled systems, {eid: 85090186086}>, <Metadata extraction and management in data lakes with GEMMS, {eid: 85029800130}>, <None, {eid: 85118156810}>, <None, {eid: 85086227308}>, <Data structure of the digital shadow for systematic knowledge management systems in single and small batch production, {eid: 85076726266}>, <Internet of production: Rethinking production management, {eid: 85091465012}>, <None, {eid: 0010246953}>, <Part data integration in the shop floor digital twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201}>, <None, {eid: 84964252876}>, <None, {eid: 85143558202}>, <None, {eid: 85118165549}>, <Modeling languages in industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>, <A digital twin for composite parts manufacturing: Effects of defects analysis based on manufacturing data, {eid: 85055549997}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/18/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85118142665

This uncertainty manifests itself in significant changes that tend to occur over the lifetime of a process and possibly affect its performance. It is important to understand the root causes of such changes since this allows us to react to change or anticipate future changes. Research in process mining has so far only focused on detecting, locating and characterizing significant changes in aprocess and not on finding root causes of such changes. In this paper, we aim to close this gap. We propose a framework that adds an explainability level onto concept drift detection in process mining and provides insights into the cause-effect relationships behind significant changes. We define different perspectives of a process, detect concept drifts in these perspectives and plug the perspectives into a causality check that determines whether these concept drifts can be causal to each other. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework by evaluating it on both synthetic and real event data. Our experiments show that our approach unravels cause-effect relationships and provides novel insights into executed processes.","Cause-effect analysis, Concept drift, Process mining",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84979530122}>, <None, {eid: 85107340093}>, <Workflow mining: Discovering process models from event logs, {eid: 4544353101}>, <None, {eid: 85115127406}>, <A survey of methods for time series change point detection, {eid: 84986255561}>, <None, {eid: 85115120829}>, <Van Zelst, S.J., van der Aalst, {eid: 85112083154}>, <Handling concept drift in process mining, {eid: 79960288084}>, <Dealing with concept drifts in process mining, {eid: 84891164329}>, <Process mining meets causal machine learning: Discovering causal rules from event logs, {eid: 85094844163}>, <Time-aware concept drift detection using the earth mover’s distance, {eid: 85096616091}>, <Online techniques for dealing with concept drift in process mining, {eid: 84868029147}>, <None, {eid: 85115165109}>, <The power of the pruned exact linear time (PELT) test in multiple changepoint detection, {eid: 85055817086}>, <Some recent development in a concept of causality, {eid: 28144459550}>, <A generic framework for context-aware process performance analysis, {eid: 84995922821}>, <Detecting change in processes using comparative trace clustering, {eid: 84962593588}>, <Discovering causal factors explaining business process performance variation, {eid: 85021196385}>, <A general process mining framework for correlating, predicting and clustering dynamic behavior based on event logs, {eid: 84949624881}>, <Complex symbolic sequence encodings for predictive monitoring of business processes, {eid: 84944674745}>, <Fast and accurate business process drift detection, {eid: 84944710205}>, <Detecting sudden and gradual drifts in business processes from execution traces, {eid: 85021917768}>, <Handling concept drift in predictive process monitoring, {eid: 85032375987}>, <Change point detection and dealing with gradual and multi-order dynamics in process mining, {eid: 84951276380}>, <Process mining: Extending the α-algorithm to mine short loops, {eid: 32144447557}>, <Analyzing resource behavior using process mining, {eid: 77954005040}>, <Characterizing drift from event streams of business processes, {eid: 85021252076}>, <Data-aware remaining time prediction of business process instances, {eid: 84908472113}>, <None, {eid: 85092657668}>, <Scenario-based prediction of business processes using system dynamics, {eid: 85077907729}>, <Supporting automatic system dynamics model generation for simulation in the context of process mining, {eid: 85089220959}>, <CPN tools for editing, simulating, and analysing coloured petri nets, {eid: 35248843991}>, <Detecting concept drift in processes using graph metrics on process graphs, {eid: 85021972833}>, <Root cause analysis with enriched process logs, {eid: 84873144149}>, <Selective review of offline change point detection methods, {eid: 85072881390}>, <None, {eid: 85115138145}>, <Process mining with the heuristics miner-algorithm, {eid: 40549143268}>, <Comprehensive process drift detection with visual analytics, {eid: 85076191162}>, <Detecting process concept drifts from event logs, {eid: 85032701222}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/6/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85115178805

This behavior model is continuously enriched by direct or derived learning, in order to improve the digital twin. The proposed DS relies on data analytics (based on unsupervised learning) and on a knowledge inference engine. It enables the incidents to be detected and it is also able to decipher its operational context. An example of this application in the aeronautic machining industry is provided to stress both the feasibility of the proposition and its potential impact on shop floor performance.","Data and knowledge management, Digital shadow, Digital twin, Machining",,,,,,,,"<Manufacturing data analytics using a virtual factory representation, {eid: 85021925713}>, <How virtualization, decentralization and network building change the manufacturing landscape: an industry 4.0 perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <The future of industrial communication: automation networks in the era of the internet of things and industry 4.0, {eid: 85017596114}>, <The digital twin: realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <Digital twin-driven smart manufacturing: connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Data structure of the digital shadow for systematic knowledge management systems in single and small batch production, {eid: 85076726266}>, <The application center industrie 4.0-industry-driven manufacturing, research and development, {eid: 85006966970}>, <Data-driven smart manufacturing, {eid: 85040599054}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85101788388}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85101789242}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <Automation systems and integration -

Increasingly, machine data is not only collected but also processed and translated into actionable decisions influencing production parameters in real-time. However, heterogeneous hardware in the Internet of Things prevents the adoption of consistent development and deployment structures as known from service containers. WebAssembly is a recent hardware-agnostic bytecode format that is capable of running not only in the browser, but also on microcontrollers and in cloud environments. In this article, we argue that this web technology can have a real impact by leveraging tools and programming languages that web engineers are familiar with. As a first step, we present a proof-of-concept integrated development and deployment environment to execute WebAssembly modules on microcontrollers. Its key feature is a built-in web server that provides a self-contained browser-based IDE to directly develop, compile and flash AssemblyScript code to a device. In this sense, the Web of Things will unfold a streamlined development and deployment context for the agile and low-latency operationalization of adjustable data streaming and action-oriented process adaptations for industrial devices.","Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, WebAssembly",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85111155359}>, <Understanding code mobility, {eid: 4544373958}>, <An execution model for serverless functions at the edge, {eid: 85066038506}>, <Not so fast: Analyzing the performance of WebAssembly vs. Native Code, {eid: 85076772981}>, <None, {eid: 85111081159}>, <None, {eid: 85111094538}>, <None, {eid: 85075605004}>, <None, {eid: 85070900711}>, <Increasing data integrity for improving decision making in production planning and control, {eid: 85018627497}>, <Opportunities of Sustainable Manufacturing in Industry 4.0, {eid: 84966671373}>, <Data aware web-assembly function placement, {eid: 85091700015}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,5/18/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85111153954

However, with the shift toward more dynamic and flexible supply chains, privacy concerns severely challenge the required information retrieval. A lack of trust between the different involved stakeholders inhibits advanced, multi-hop information flows, as valuable information for tracking and tracing products and parts is either unavailable or only retained locally. Our extensive literature review of previous approaches shows that these needs for cross-company information retrieval are widely acknowledged, but related work currently only addresses them insufficiently. To overcome these concerns, we present PrivAccIChain, a secure, privacy-preserving architecture for improving the multi-hop information retrieval with stakeholder accountability along supply chains. To address use case-specific needs, we particularly introduce an adaptable configuration of transparency and data privacy within our design. Hence, we enable the benefits of information sharing as well as multi-hop tracking and tracing even in supply chains that include mutually distrusting stakeholders. We evaluate the performance of PrivAccIChain and demonstrate its real-world feasibility based on the information of a purchasable automobile, the e.GO Life. We further conduct an in-depth security analysis and propose tunable mitigations against common attacks. As such, we attest PrivAccIChain's practicability for information management even in complex supply chains with flexible and dynamic business relationships.","Attribute-based encryption, e.GO,

These, in turn, allow for data-driven analysis that has the potential for deepening the process understanding by discovering previously unknown connections between process components and parameters. With these opportunities, however, come substantial challenges as current industrial settings are inadequately equipped for handling these large amounts of data. While setting up a local processing infrastructure is challenging, the limited bandwidth within many shop floors as well as their network access also make an upload of all data to external compute capacities infeasible. What is needed are local, process-aware filters that allow for significant data reduction while retaining data of value that can be used for the subsequent analysis. In this paper, we thus propose to leverage In-Network Computing to dynamically detect different states of the physical processes and then filter the sensor values on the data path. Our presented architecture maps the state detection to the switch-local controlplane while fast filtering decisions are performed at line-rate in the dataplane, thus enabling flexible and quick adjustments of the chosen sensor filtering. At the example of a fine-blanking line, we consequently demonstrate that In-Network Computing can sensibly support previously infeasible data analysis techniques in the industrial production landscape.","Clustering methods, Communication systems, Condition monitoring, Edge computing, Industrial communication, Pattern recognition, Process monitoring, Software defined networking",,,,,,,,"<Industrial internet of things: Challenges, opportunities, and directions, {eid: 85049358359}>, <Industry 4. 0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <A survey on network methodologies for real-time analytics of massive iot data and open research issues, {eid: 85029487083}>, <Enabling wide area data analytics with collaborative distributed processing pipelines (cdpps), {eid: 85027252344}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <None, {eid: 79956288646}>, <Punch-to-punch variations in stamping processes, {eid: 85087072182}>, <Using stamping punch force variation for the identification of changes in lubrication and wear mechanism, {eid: 85032448650}>, <Estimating product-to-product variations in metal forming using force measurements, {eid: 85037677782}>, <Fault diagnosis of stamping process based on empirical mode decomposition and learning vector quantization, {eid: 35348897459}>, <Stamping process modelling in an internet of production, {eid: 85090495871}>, <An spc monitoring system for cycle-based waveform signals using haar transform, {eid: 33947184273}>, <When to collect what?

To reduce complexity in this concern, the authors propose the SensOr Interfacing Language (SOIL), a domain-specific programming language for sensor interface definition and exchange of metrological data. Based on a meta-model, the functional interface can be designed without prior knowledge of the underlying communication details. It is composed of instances of components, parameters, functions and measurements as core elements of SOIL. Subsequently, the interface is automatically defined on protocol level and its software implementation is generated, leaving only the hardware-specific implementation to the developer. The domain-specific language is prototyped and evaluated by implementing and integrating interfaces for a virtual laser tracker and a distributed temperature measurement system, confirming the envisaged benefits.","Data analytics, Domain-specific language, Internet of production, Sensor",,,,,,,,"<Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <Sensor information as a service -component of networked production, {eid: 85047360163, doi: 10.5194/jsss-7-389-2018}>, <UML4IoT-A UML-based approach to exploit IoT in cyber-physical manufacturing systems, {eid: 84995741402}>, <None, {eid: 55749096123}>, <None, {eid: 85166000525}>, <When and how to develop domain-specific languages, {eid: 33745167684, doi: 10.1145/1118890.1118892}>, <A study on the suitability of visual languages for non-expert robot programmers, {eid: 85061816279, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895913}>, <Midgar: Generation of heterogeneous objects interconnecting applications.

Building on literature in moral and legal philosophy, and ethics of technology, the paper proposes a broader and more comprehensive analysis of the responsibility gap. The responsibility gap, it is argued, is not one problem but a set of at least four interconnected problems – gaps in culpability, moral and public accountability, active responsibility—caused by different sources, some technical, other organisational, legal, ethical, and societal. Responsibility gaps may also happen with non-learning systems. The paper clarifies which aspect of AI may cause which gap in which form of responsibility, and why each of these gaps matter. It proposes a critical review of partial and non-satisfactory attempts to address the responsibility gap: those which present it as a new and intractable problem (“fatalism”), those which dismiss it as a false problem (“deflationism”), and those which reduce it to only one of its dimensions or sources and/or present it as a problem that can be solved by simply introducing new technical and/or legal tools (“solutionism”). The paper also outlines a more comprehensive approach to address the responsibility gaps with AI in their entirety, based on the idea of designing socio-technical systems for “meaningful human control"", that is systems aligned with the relevant human reasons and capacities.","AI and accountability, AI ethics, Engineer responsibility, Meaningful human control, Responsibility gap",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85097864150}>, <Article 36, {eid: 85105924887}>, <A body to kick, but still no soul to damn: Legal perspectives on robotics, {eid: 84876855637}>, <None, {eid: 85104771203}>, <Fatal U.S, {eid: 85105964370}>, <).

This article explores the impact of design factors of the robotic interface (anthropomorphic vs functional) and usage context (production vs care) on human-robot trust and attributions. Theresults of a scenario-based survey with N = 228 N=228 participants showed a higher willingness to collaborate with production robots compared to care. Context and design influenced the trust attributed to the robots: robots with a technical appearance in production were trusted more than anthropomorphic robots or robots in the care context. The evaluation of attributions by means of a semanticdifferential showed that differences in robot design were less pronounced for the production context in comparison to the care context. In the latter, anthropomorphic robots were associated with positive attributes. The results contribute to a better understanding of the complex nature of trust in automation and can be used to identify and shape use case-specific risk perceptions as well as perceived opportunities to interacting with collaborative robots. Findings of this study are pertinent to research (e.g., experts in human-robot interaction) and industry, with special regard given tothe technical development and design.","assistance robotics, attribution, collaborative robotics, human-robot collaboration, human-robot interaction, semantic differential, technology acceptance, trust in automation",,,,,,,,"<""human-robot collaboration: A survey,"", {eid: 84938150940}>, <""world Population Prospects 2019.

Potentials and challenges are identified using separate SWOT analyses for the three prospections and common themes are emphasized in a concluding discussion.","cyber physical production system, Digital Shadow, Internet of Production, user usage",,,,,,,,"<Task-Specific Decision Support Systems in Multi-Level Production Systems based on the digital shadow, {eid: 85070899680}>, <Digital Shadow Platform as an Innovative Business Model, {eid: 85070536167}>, <Methodology for the derivation of a digital shadow for engineering management, {eid: 85056551092}>, <Interdisciplinary Data Driven Production Process Analysis for the Internet of Production, {eid: 85052892358}>, <Big Data, Fast Data and Data Lake Concepts, {eid: 85006413324}>, <Wie man mit dem digitalen Schatten die Produktion vorhersehen kann, {eid: 85116008355}>, <Digital Shadow-From production to product, {eid: 85049153402}>, <A Research Framework for Human Aspects in the Internet of Production : An Intra-company Perspective, {eid: 85088241948}>, <Your costumers digital shadow-Objection of human perception by a multisensory measurement system, {eid: 85092434875}>, <Effizientere Produktion mit Digitalen Schatten, {eid: 85087124263}>, <None, {eid: 85116008071}>, <Edanken zur Zukunft der Zukunftsforschung, {eid: 85098806590}>, <Wissenschaftliche Validität als Qualitätsmerkmal der Zukunftsforschung, {eid: 85084538528}>, <Wovon ist die Zukunftsforschung eine Wissenschaft?, {eid: 84904368886}>, <Prospection: Experiencing the future, {eid: 34548676552}>, <Methods of Future and Scenario Analysis: Overview, Assessment, and Selection Criteria, {eid: 84874778536}>, <SWOT analysis, {eid: 84885063265}>, <Intuitive Work Assistance by Reciprocal Human-robot Interaction in the Subject Area of Direct Human-robot Collaboration, {eid: 84994097022}>, <Design Principles for Safety in Human-Robot Interaction, {eid: 84857625100}>, <Ergonomische Arbeitsplatzgestaltung unter Einsatz kollaborierender Robotersysteme: Eine praxisorientierte Einführung, {eid: 85064828091}>, <Cooperation of humans and machines in assembly lines, {eid: 70449518083}>, <Humans in the loop online estimation of robotic speed limits for safe human robot collaboration, {eid: 85099813597}>, <Sequence Planning Considering Human Fatigue for Human-Robot Collaboration in Disassembly, {eid: 85070545856}>, <Imitation Learning, {eid: 85017424752}>, <Media Comparison for Instruction-based AR Usage in Collaborative Assembly, {eid: 85115999347}>, <The uncanny valley from the field, {eid: 84862286533}>, <A Model for Types and Levels of Human Interaction with Automation, {eid: 0033705992}>, <Measuring Mental Workload Using Physiological Measures: A Systematic Review, {eid: 85053216584}>, <Coping with human errors through system design: Implications for ecological interface design, {eid: 0024771351}>, <State of Science: Mental Workload in Ergonomics, {eid: 84921435717}>, <Why consider the human-in-the-loop in automated cyber-physical production systems?

Such deployments rely on the flexibility and scalability of systems and devices. Heterogeneous systems need to be interoperable and work together seamlessly. In order to manage such system of systems, it is important to work with a framework that not only supports the flexible nature of IoT systems but also provides adequate support for industrial requirements, such as real-time and runtime features, architectural approaches, hardware constraints, standardization, industrial support, interoperability, and security. The selection of an appropriate framework results difficult due to the rising number of available frameworks and platforms, which offer different support for the aforementioned requirements. Therefore, this article investigates the features of seven prominent frameworks for the purpose of simplifying the selection of a suitable framework for an industrial application. The aim of this article is to present the recent developments and state-of-the-art of industrial IoT frameworks and provide a technical comparison of their features and characteristics.","Frameworks, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), system of systems (SoS)",,,,,,,,"<The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): An analysis framework, {eid: 85047947260}>, <Industrial Internet of Things:Challenges, opportunities, and directions, {eid: 85049358359}>, <Internet of Things: Architectures, protocols, and applications, {eid: 85012191658}>, <Internet of Things security: A survey, {eid: 85017561368}>, <A survey on Internet of Things architectures, {eid: 85005952241}>, <None, {eid: 85028362968}>, <Botnets and Internet of Things security, {eid: 85012917393}>, <Integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things:Asurvey, {eid: 84958935292}>, <A review of Internet of Things for smart home: Challenges and solutions, {eid: 85028237634}>, <5G Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 85044977720}>, <Asurvey of commercial frameworks for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84952907595}>, <Internet of Things: A survey on the security of IoT frameworks, {eid: 85034956984}>, <None, {eid: 85102737302}>, <None, {eid: 85052594100}>, <Enabling IoT automation using local clouds, {eid: 85015159190}>, <The arrowhead approach for SOA application development and documentation, {eid: 84949513541}>, <None, {eid: 85102769386}>, <None, {eid: 85102753982}>, <None, {eid: 85102741758}>, <None, {eid: 85102771044}>, <None, {eid: 85102739571}>, <None, {eid: 85080705565}>, <None, {eid: 85102775737}>, <None, {eid: 85102737148}>, <None, {eid: 85072047817}>, <Industrial data space architecture implementation using fiware, {eid: 85050079149}>, <None, {eid: 85075886677}>, <None, {eid: 85102727200}>, <None, {eid: 85102747812}>, <None, {eid: 85102760084}>, <None, {eid: 85102765136}>, <None, {eid: 85102743283}>, <None, {eid: 85102739047}>, <None, {eid: 85066052205}>, <None, {eid: 85102757742}>, <None, {eid: 85086592325}>, <None, {eid: 85102746713}>, <None, {eid: 85068842505}>, <None, {eid: 85102760351}>, <None, {eid: 85102748915}>, <None, {eid: 85102756628}>, <Local cloud Internet of Things automation: Technology and business model features of distributed Internet of Things automation solutions, {eid: 85040319910}>, <Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Future modeling and simulation of CPS-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563}>, <Middleware for Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 84959420432}>, <Arrowhead framework core systems and services, {eid: 85052570810}>, <None, {eid: 85102734647}>, <None, {eid: 85102778739}>, <None, {eid: 85102746117}>, <Autonomous production workstation operation, reconfiguration and synchronization, {eid: 85082752789}>, <None, {eid: 85102734564}>, <None, {eid: 85065678373}>, <None, {eid: 85102759640}>, <None, {eid: 85102756754}>, <None, {eid: 85102734679}>, <Terminology for constrainednode networks, {eid: 84978048918}>, <None, {eid: 85102725658}>, <None, {eid: 85102761502}>, <Quality of service on the arrowhead framework, {eid: 85033563877}>, <None, {eid: 85102774711}>, <None, {eid: 85102770713}>, <None, {eid: 85102729659}>, <None, {eid: 85102739053}>, <None, {eid: 85102760024}>, <None, {eid: 85102750264}>, <None, {eid: 85102744060}>, <None, {eid: 85102765431}>, <None, {eid: 85102761297}>, <Interoperability, {eid: 0001649084}>, <None, {eid: 66149130951}>, <A systematic review to merge discourses: Interoperability, integration and cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85044008633}>, <None, {eid: 85102739053}>, <Flow based security for IoT devices using an SDN gateway, {eid: 84992111597}>, <Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and security issues, {eid: 85034595585}>, <An AAA solution for securing industrial IoT devices using next generation access control, {eid: 85050142256}>, <None, {eid: 85102779670}>, <None, {eid: 85100131028}>, <None, {eid: 85102756586}>, <None, {eid: 85102769257}>, <None, {eid: 85102763738}>, <None, {eid: 85102739219}>, <None, {eid: 85102770902}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,3/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85102736071

Yet, In-Network Computing (INC) is challenged by the limitations of networking hardware which is generally not designed for complex calculations. Thus, while possible, developing INC approaches is a constant struggle between desired and available functionality. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of INC to industrial contexts by offloading a seemingly simple task from an industrial assembly scenario - coordinate transformations - to programmable switches and SmartNICs. We find that even such a task puts heavy demands on the devices, but that the right dose of approximation and diligent problem reformulation can enable the necessary operations on all platforms, thus setting the stage for improving latencies by significantly reducing communication paths. Yet, our results further indicate that these gains in latency come in hand with a trade-off regarding the achievable accuracy.","Approximation, In-network computing, Latency",,,,,,,,"<Netcache: Balancing key-value stores with fast in-network caching, {eid: 85041680951}>, <In-network computation is a dumb idea whose time has come, {eid: 85041220007}>, <Omnimon: Re-architecting network telemetry with resource efficiency and full accuracy, {eid: 85094854926}>, <P4: Programming protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <Evaluating the power of flexible packet processing for network resource allocation, {eid: 85076886586}>, <Towards in-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <None, {eid: 85112393160}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85070900711}>, <Investigation of the applicability of an igps metrology system to automate the assembly in motion of a truck cabin, {eid: 85046087720}>, <Modelling and assessing line-less mobile assembly systems, {eid: 85068461888}>, <Large-scale dimensional metrology (lsdm): From tapes and theodolites to multi-sensor systems, {eid: 84905645625}>, <Experiments towards automated sewing with a multi-robot system, {eid: 84864464494}>, <A new paradigm in large scale assembly-research priorities in measurement assisted assembly, {eid: 84895922499}>, <None, {eid: 85112361797}>, <Chapter 6-finite word length effects, {eid: 85112369372}>, <None, {eid: 0003892951}>, <Estimating logarithmic and exponential functions to track network traffic entropy in p4, {eid: 85086762626}>, <Efficient measurement on programmable switches using probabilistic recirculation, {eid: 85058094316}>, <Jumpgate: In-network processing as a service for data analytics, {eid: 85084164332}>, <Towards executing computer vision functionality on programmable network devices, {eid: 85078956735}>, <Towards low latency industrial robot control in programmable data planes, {eid: 85091982375}>, <When should the network be the computer?, {eid: 85066897745}>, <Netmap: A novel framework for fast packet i/o, {eid: 85077130189}>, <P4fpga: A rapid prototyping framework for p4, {eid: 85018980039}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85108233443

Beyond company-internal data exploitation, the sharing of product and manufacturing process data along and across supply chains enables more efficient production flows and product lifecycle management. Even more, data-based automation facilitates short-lived ad hoc collaborations, realizing highly dynamic business relationships for sustainable exploitation of production resources and capacities. However, the sharing and use of business data across manufacturers and with end customers add requirements on data accountability, verifiability, and reliability and needs to consider security and privacy demands. While research has already identified blockchain technology as a key technology to address these challenges, current solutions mainly evolve around logistics or focus on established business relationships instead of automated but highly dynamic collaborations that cannot draw upon long-term trust relationships. We identify three open research areas on the road to such a truly accountable and dependable manufacturing enabled by blockchain technology: blockchain-inherent challenges, scenario-driven challenges, and socio-economic challenges. Especially tackling the scenario-driven challenges, we discuss requirements and options for realizing a blockchain-based trustworthy information store and outline its use for automation to achieve a reliable sharing of product information, efficient and dependable collaboration, and dynamic distributed markets without requiring established long-term trust.","blockchain, industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, Internet of Production, manufacturing, scalability, secure industrial collaboration, supply chain management",,,,,,,,"<Smart manufacturing must embrace big data, {eid: 85017175038, doi: 10.1038/544023a}>, <Intelligent Sensors for Real-Time Decision-Making, {eid: 85112690863, doi: 10.3390/automation2020004}>, <ESG and financial performance: Aggregated evidence from more than 2000 empirical studies, {eid: 85048892849, doi: 10.1080/20430795.2015.1118917}>, <Sustainable Manufacturing and Design: Concepts, Practices and Needs, {eid: 84861371942, doi: 10.3390/su4020154}>, <From a literature review to a conceptual framework for sustainable supply chain management, {eid: 47649115146, doi: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2008.04.020}>, <Towards an Infrastructure Enabling the Internet of Production, {eid: 85070900711, doi: 10.1109/ICPHYS.2019.8780276}>, <Industrial Internet of Things: Challenges, Opportunities, and Directions, {eid: 85049358359, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2852491}>, <Dataflow Challenges in an Internet of Production: A Security & Privacy Perspective, {eid: 85075014511, doi: 10.1145/3338499.3357357}>, <Information Sharing as a Coordination Mechanism for Reducing the Bullwhip Effect in a Supply Chain, {eid: 34247280386, doi: 10.1109/TSMCC.2006.887014}>, <Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange, {eid: 85098082854, doi: 10.1145/3427228.3427248}>, <ProductChain: Scalable Blockchain Framework to Support Provenance in Supply Chains, {eid: 85059990078, doi: 10.1109/NCA.2018.8548322}>, <FactDAG: Formalizing Data Interoperability in an Internet of Production, {eid: 85083740453, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2020.2966402}>, <How to Securely Prune Bitcoin’s Blockchain, {eid: 85090029475}>, <Blockchain Practices, Potentials, and Perspectives in Greening Supply Chains, {eid: 85054917337, doi: 10.3390/su10103652}>, <Blockchain Technology Implementation in Logistics, {eid: 85062170305, doi: 10.3390/su11041185}>, <The Unknown Potential of Blockchain for Sustainable Supply Chains, {eid: 85095990599, doi: 10.3390/su12229400}>, <A Blockchain-Based Framework for Green Logistics in Supply Chains, {eid: 85086412793, doi: 10.3390/su12114656}>, <Smart Contracts in the Context of Procure-to-Pay, {eid: 85180825635, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-61947-3_1}>, <Blockchain Technology and Its Role in Enhancing Supply Chain Integration Capability and Reducing Carbon Emission: A Conceptual Framework, {eid: 85098168151, doi: 10.3390/su122410550}>, <The Effect of Blockchain Technology on Supply Chain Sustainability Performances, {eid: 85100834223, doi: 10.3390/su13041726}>, <Digitalizing the Closing-of-the-Loop for Supply Chains: A Transportation and Blockchain Perspective, {eid: 85102709268, doi: 10.3390/su13052895}>, <Blockchain technology and its relationships to sustainable supply chain management, {eid: 85055168966, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2018.1533261}>, <Blockchain Technology and Manufacturing Industry: Real-Time Transparency and Cost Savings, {eid: 85056730694, doi: 10.3390/su10114274}>, <Applicability of Blockchain Technology in Scheduling Resources Within Distributed Manufacturing, {eid: 85101977860, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-29821-0_7}>, <Blockchain in operations management and manufacturing: Potential and barriers, {eid: 85090351154, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2020.106789}>, <What Drives the Implementation of Industry 4.0?

Used by CAMX – The Composites and Advanced Materials ExpoIn past years, the average amount of time a human spends on digital devices increased remarkably. This change towards consumption of mostly digital contents is driven by the increasing availability of data and the accompanying digitization of knowledge. Yet, data availability in composite production is still up to this day either scarce or non-existent, leading to error-prone and experience-based decision-making. This is due to only implicitly available and rarely documented know-how. Therefore, in this contribution we present our vision of a manufacturing concept, facilitating the continuous digitization and documentation of process, material, and design knowledge. The manufacturing concept is based on the idea of an Internet of Production, according to which artificial intelligence, expert knowledge, web technologies, and user-centered graphical user interfaces are applied. We realize our vision within the scope of composite process planning as a first proof-of-concept. In this context, research opportunities, the industry’s benefit as well as augmented applications and future challenges are elaborated.","AI, Autonomous Agents, Composites, Continuously Improving Process, Internet of Production, Manufacturing, Process Planning, User-centered, Web Technologies",,,,,,,,"<Composite manufacturing data management in aerospace industry, {eid: 84968773494, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2015.12.058}>, <Increasing the sustainability of composite manufacturing processes by using algorithm-based optimisation and evaluation for process chain design, {eid: 85084926607, doi: 10.1504/IJSM.2020.107128}>, <Big data in agriculture: Does the new oil lead to sustainability?, {eid: 85077081346, doi: 10.1016/j.geoforum.2019.12.019}>, <Digital Shadows in the Internet of Production, {eid: 85074214541}>, <None, {eid: 85027012188}>, <None, {eid: 0003638853}>, <Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Shape Recognition, {eid: 84973882748}>, <Linked Data - the story so far, {eid: 77952649961}>, <Information Systems Engineering with Digital Shadows: Concept and Case Studies, {eid: 85086253990, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-49435-3_5}>, <FactDAG: Formalizing Data Interoperability in an Internet of Production, {eid: 85083740453, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2020.2966402}>, <FactStack: Interoperable Data Management and Preservation for the Web and Industry 4.0, {eid: 85111103877, doi: 10.18420/btw2021-20}>, <Adapting Golog for composition of Semantic Web services, {eid: 0011491265}>, <None, {eid: 84944405978, doi: 10.1016/C2013-0-15269-5}>, <Smart Agents in Industrial Cyber–Physical Systems, {eid: 84977992593, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2016.2521931}>, <None, {eid: 0003944811}>, <None, {eid: 38049109290, doi: 10.5555/2826087}>, <A Closer Look on the User Centered Design, {eid: 85009962755, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.656}>, <Intelligent Manufacturing Science of Innovative Composite Structures Based on Optical-Fiber Life Cycle Monitoring, {eid: 85124277540, doi: 10.21820/23987073.2017.5.49}>",,,The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX),,,10/19/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85124263660

Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol. We exemplarily implement ENTRUST on top of MQTT, the de-facto standard for machine-to-machine communication, showing that ENTRUST can integrate seamlessly into existing publish/subscribe systems.","cyber-physical system security, end-to-end security, publish-subscribe security",,,,,,,,"<ProMACs: Progressive and resynchronizing macs for continuous efficient authentication of message streams, {eid: 85096175182}>, <The internet of things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <None, {eid: 85107453395}>, <Authorizations in cloud-based internet of things: Current trends and use cases, {eid: 85071695326}>, <PICADOR: End-to-end encrypted publish-subscribe information distribution with proxy re-encryption, {eid: 85005917675}>, <Easing the conscience with opc ua: An internet-wide study on insecure deployments, {eid: 85097285990}>, <Context-sensitive policy based security in internet of things, {eid: 84979502238}>, <ChaCha20-poly1305 authenticated encryption for high-speed embedded iot applications, {eid: 85020170240}>, <The transport layer security (tls) protocol version 1.2, {eid: 33847753565}>, <When will my PLC support Mirai?

Consequently, to ensure end-to-end secure communication and authentication, (i) traditional industrial protocols, e.g., Modbus, are retrofitted with TLS support, and (ii) modern protocols, e.g., MQTT, are directly designed to use TLS. To understand whether these changes indeed lead to secure Industrial Internet of Things deployments, i.e., using TLS-based protocols, which are configured according to security best practices, we perform an Internet-wide security assessment of ten industrial protocols covering the complete IPv4 address space. Our results show that both, retrofitted existing protocols and newly developed secure alternatives, are barely noticeable in the wild. While we find that new protocols have a higher TLS adoption rate than traditional protocols (7.2% vs. 0.4%), the overall adoption of TLS is comparably low (6.5% of hosts). Thus, most industrial deployments (934,736 hosts) are insecurely connected to the Internet. Furthermore, we identify that 42% of hosts with TLS support (26,665 hosts) show security deficits, e.g., missing access control. Finally, we show that support in configuring systems securely, e.g., via configuration templates, is promising to strengthen security.","industrial communication, network security, security

100,,,,Development of manufacturing execution systems in accordance with industry 4. 0 requirements: A review of standard-and ontologybased methodologies and tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This work presents how recent trends in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) solutions are influencing the development of manufacturing execution systems (MESs) and analyzes what kinds of trends will determine the development of the next generation of these technologies. This systematic and thematic review provides a detailed analysis of I4.0-related requirements in terms of MES functionalities and an overview of MES development methods and standards because these three aspects are essential in developing MESs. The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information. The presented overview can serve as a guide for engineers interested in the development of MESs as well as for researchers interested in finding worthwhile areas of research.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85090014332
105,,,,"Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85077515399
108,,,,Information systems engineering with digital shadows: Concept and case studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Entering the second decade of the Industrie 4.0 vision, the production sector is facing challenges in taking full advantage of global digitalization. Production research has focused on sophisticated mathematical models ranging from molecular materials modeling to production control to supply chain logistics. These models help simulate and control the related physical system but the variety of individual situations and behaviors is captured only as statistical uncertainty. The emergence of data-driven methods adds statistical or AI models learned from real-time production data to Digital Twins, and ideally allows for continuous synchronization (twinning) between physical and virtual system.
However, the complexity of todays production systems precludes Digital Twins covering more than just a few system perspectives, especially if realtime performance is required. To achieve better performance and more precise context adaptation, the interdisciplinary research cluster Internet of Production at RWTH Aachen University is exploring the concept of Digital Shadows. We conceptualize Digital Shadows as a generalization of compact views on dynamic processes, whose defining query combines condensed measurement data with efficient simplified mathematical models. Their small size makes Digital Shadows amenable to dynamic function allocation in hybrid cloudedge settings. In addition to showing the similarities and differences to the traditional view concept, we also present a conceptual embedding of Digital Shadows in the context of large distributed system architectures, and sovereign data exchange in international Data Space communities. Two production use case experiences demonstrate that Digital Shadows can be valuable carriers of deep and reusable engineering knowledge for technical and ecological progress.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85086253990
109,,,,Interdisciplinary engineering of cyberphysical production systems: Highlighting the benefits of a combined interdisciplinary modelling approach on the basis of an industrial case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the context of cross-disciplinary and cross-company cooperation, several challenges in developing manufacturing systems are revealed through industrial use cases. To tackle these challenges, two propositions are used in parallel. First, coupling technical models representing different content areas facilitates the detection of boundary crossing consequences, either by using a posteriori or a priori connection. Second, it is necessary to enrich these coupled technical models with team and organizational models as interventions focusing on the collaboration between individuals and teams within broader organizational conditions. Accordingly, a combined interdisciplinary approach is proposed. The feasibility and benefits of the approach is proven with an industrial use case. The use case shows that inconsistencies among teams can be identified by coupling engineering models and that an integrated organizational model can release the modelling process from communication barriers.

119,,,,The applications of industry 4. 0 technologies in manufacturing context: A systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry 4.0 (I4.0) encompasses a plethora of digital technologies effecting on manufacturing enterprises. Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85093949784
