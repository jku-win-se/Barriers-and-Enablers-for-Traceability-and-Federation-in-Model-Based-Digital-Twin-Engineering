BDA procedure can be efficiently automated by the automatic service composition concept efficiently. Our previous work for Auto-BDA shows a great future prospect in reducing turnaround time for data analysis. Moreover, it requires consideration of the automation with a well-geared combination of the data preparation and the optimal model (deep learning) generation. This paper shows the construction of automating BDA and model generation (here deep learning) together with data preparation and parameter optimization.","Automatic-service-composition, Automation, Big-Data-Analysis, CRISP-DM, Deep-learning-generation",,,,,,,,"<Architecture for intelligent big data analysis based on automatic service composition, {eid: 85032348782}>, <QoS-aware rule-based traffic-efficient multi-objective service selection in big data space, {eid: 85052636646, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867633}>, <Scalable architecture for automatic service composition, {eid: 84894430070}>, <Constructing a global social service network for better quality of web service discovery, {eid: 84927733794}>, <None, {eid: 85079948975}>, <Efficient and robust automated machine learning, {eid: 84965128050}>, <Toward automated deep learning: Efficient joint neural architecture and hyperparameter search, {eid: 85072648093}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/5/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079284060

This paper surveys the recent literature on data management as it applies to networked industrial environments and identifies several open research challenges for the future. As a first step, we extract important data properties (volume, variety, traffic, and criticality) and identify the corresponding data enabling technologies of diverse fundamental industrial use cases, based on practical applications. Second, we provide a detailed outline of recent industrial architectural designs with respect to their data management philosophy (data presence, data coordination, and data computation) and the extent of their distributiveness. Then, we conduct a holistic survey of the recent literature from which we derive a taxonomy of the latest advances in industrial data enabling technologies and data centric services, spanning all the way from the field level deep in the physical deployments, up to the cloud and applications level. Finally, motivated by the rich conclusions of this critical analysis, we identify interesting open challenges for future research. The concepts presented in this paper thematically cover the largest part of the industrial automation pyramid layers. Our approach is multidisciplinary, as the selected publications were drawn from two fields; the communications, networking and computation field, and the industrial, manufacturing, and automation field. This paper can help the readers to deeply understand how data management is currently applied in networked industrial environments, and select interesting open research opportunities to pursue.","Data

This work is a Proof of Concept to evaluate if the NAOTherapist Architecture can be distributed into several computers, to get the benefits from Cloud Computing and Robotics as a Service. This work focuses on the enhancement of the NAOTherapist architecture, in which some of the components that compose the architecture have been integrated into a cloud server. This new architecture allows to protect the source code from being copied and to share the resources charged with the intelligence of the platform. The distributed architecture introduce new problems as the communication delay caused by the communication over the network. Then, this problems has been evaluated both technically and surveying the patients involved in the experiments performed. These evaluations have shown promising results, confirming that it is possible to deploy NAOTherapist as a Robotics as a Service.","Cloud Computing, Neurorehabilitation, Robotic as a Service, Socially assistive robotics",,,,,,,,"<Robot as a service in cloud computing, {eid: 78449242569}>, <A three-layer planning architecture for the autonomous control of rehabilitation therapies based on social robots, {eid: 85016811679}>, <Cloud robotics: Architecture, challenges and applications, {eid: 84861325199}>, <Architectural design of a cloud robotic system for upper-limb rehabilitation with multimodal interaction, {eid: 85014806375}>, <None, {eid: 77954051808}>, <A socially assistive robotic platform for upper-limb rehabilitation: A longitudinal study with pediatric patients, {eid: 85064377852}>, <Evaluating the child-robot interaction of the NAOTherapist platform in pediatric rehabilitation, {eid: 85021663205}>, <A comprehensive survey of recent trends in cloud robotics architectures and applications, {eid: 85056406216}>",,,Springer,,,11/20/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85079102745

DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM.","Digital twin, industry 40, modeling, prediction, smart

Primarily, MBSE was used to manage complex engineering projects in terms of system requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities, leaving security aspects aside. However, previous research showed that security requirements and risks could be tackled in the MBSE model, and powerful MBSE tools such as simulation, change impact analysis, automated document generation, validation, and verification could be successfully reused in the multidisciplinary field. This article analyzes various security-related techniques and then clarifies how these techniques can be represented in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) model and then further exploited with MBSE tools. The paper introduces the MBSEsec method, which gives guidelines for the security analysis process, the SysML/UML-based security profile, and recommendations on what security technique is needed at each security process phase. The MBSEsec method was verified by creating an application case study that reflects real-world problems and running an experiment where systems and security engineers evaluated the feasibility of our approach.","MBSE, MBSEsec, Security, SysML",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 36448929181}>, <Model-based systems engineering: Motivation, current status and research opportunities, {eid: 85046694426}>, <MBSE driven approach for defining problem domain, {eid: 84985987052}>, <MBSE Grid: A simplified SysML-based approach for modeling complex systems, {eid: 85050970923}>, <Economic analysis of model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111300041}>, <None, {eid: 85049832279}>, <None, {eid: 85083424076}>, <A systematic approach to define the domain of information system security risk management, {eid: 84892326872}>, <Combined assessment of software safety and security requirements: An industrial evaluation of the CHASSIS method, {eid: 85041217107}>, <None, {eid: 33644658584}>, <None, {eid: 77956603862}>, <None, {eid: 85082764928}>, <None, {eid: 85083443132}>, <Using a systems of systems modeling approach for developing Industrial Internet of Things applications, {eid: 85028533320}>, <A combined process for elicitation and analysis of safety and security requirements, {eid: 84864207296}>, <UMLsec: Extending UML for secure systems development, {eid: 0242403961}>, <Tools for secure systems development with UML, {eid: 35348959376}>, <From goal-driven security requirements engineering to secure design, {eid: 77954504239}>, <SysML-Sec: A model driven approach for designing safe and secure systems, {eid: 84939500992}>, <SysML-Sec: A model-driven environment for Developing Secure Embedded Systems, {eid: 85083440806}>, <None, {eid: 85083455262}>, <A practical wireless attack on the connected car and security protocol for in-vehicleCAN, {eid: 85027931391}>, <Security of autonomous vehicle as a cyber-physical system, {eid: 85050699159}>, <None, {eid: 85083464410}>, <Security requirements patterns: Understanding the science behind the art of pattern writing, {eid: 84871532652}>",,,MDPI AG,,,4/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85083444957

Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain, achieves great success and promotes more development in this field. However, Bitcoin encounters performance problems of low throughput and high transaction latency. Other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work also inherit the flaws, leading to more concerns about the scalability of blockchain. This paper attempts to cover the existing scaling solutions for blockchain and classify them by level. In addition, we make comparisons between different methods and list some potential directions for solving the scalability problem of blockchain.","Blockchain, scalability",,,,,,,,"<Bitcoin: A

35,,,,Cooperative heterogeneous multirobot systems: A survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The emergence of the Internet of things and the widespread deployment of diverse computing systems have led to the formation of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) to complete a variety of tasks. Motivated to highlight the state of the art on existing MAS while identifying their limitations, remaining challenges, and possible future directions, we survey recent contributions to the field. We focus on robot agents and emphasize the challenges of MAS sub-fields including task decomposition, coalition formation, task allocation, perception, and multi-agent planning and control. While some components have seen more advancements than others, more research is required before effective autonomous MAS can be deployed in real smart city settings that are less restrictive than the assumed validation environments of MAS. Specifically, more autonomous end-to-end solutions need to be experimentally tested and developed while incorporating natural language ontology and dictionaries to automate complex task decomposition and leveraging big data advancements to improve perception algorithms for robotics.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85065747184
