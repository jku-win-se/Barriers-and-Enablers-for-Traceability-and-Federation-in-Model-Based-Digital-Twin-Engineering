All rights reserved.Large-scale cyber-physical systems such as manufacturing lines generate vast amounts of data to guarantee precise control of their machinery. Visions such as the Industrial Internet of Things aim at making this data available also to computation systems outside the lines to increase productivity and product quality. However, rising amounts and complexities of data and control decisions push existing infrastructure for data transmission, storage, and processing to its limits. In this paper, we exemplarily study a fine blanking line which can produce up to 6.2 Gbit/s worth of data to showcase the extreme requirements found in modern manufacturing. We consequently propose integrated data processing which keeps inherently local and small-scale tasks close to the processes while at the same time centralizing tasks relying on more complex decision procedures and remote data sources. Our approach thus allows for both maintaining control of field-level processes and leveraging the benefits of ŌĆ£big dataŌĆØ applications.",,,,,,,,,"<Industrial cyberphysical systems: A backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, {eid: 85017598124}>, <Industrial internet of things and cyber manufacturing systems, {eid: 85002143570}>, <Drivers of digital transformation in manufacturing, {eid: 85065769623}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Industrial big data analytics and cyber-physical systems for future maintenance & service innovation, {eid: 84964030208}>, <Promoting work-based learning through INDUSTRY 4.0, {eid: 84939782065}>, <Concept of predictive maintenance of production systems in accordance with industry 4.0, {eid: 85017601893}>, <A comprehensive approach to privacy in the cloud-based internet of things, {eid: 84958927315}>, <Value creation in big data scenarios: A literature survey, {eid: 85032867605}>, <Networking for big data: A survey, {eid: 85014086530}>, <Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity, {eid: 84864030546}>, <None, {eid: 84876494973}>, <Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics, {eid: 84919389514}>, <The three generations of field-level networks - Evolution and compatibility issues, {eid: 77957990921}>, <Secure low latency communication for constrained industrial IoT scenarios, {eid: 85081223224}>, <None, {eid: 79956288646}>, <None, {eid: 57949086855}>, <Dependencies of the die-roll height during fine blanking of case hardening steel 16mncr5 without v-ring using a nesting strategy, {eid: 85037145302}>, <Application of the finite-element deformation method in the fine blanking process, {eid: 0030783406}>, <Setup of a parameterized FE model for the die roll prediction in fine blanking using artificial neural networks, {eid: 85032456354}>, <A study on the effect of V-ring position on the die roll height in fine blanking for special automobile seat recliner gear, {eid: 85108289415}>, <Finite element analysis on the effect of die clearance on shear planes in fine blanking, {eid: 0037147015}>, <None, {eid: 0012432442}>, <In-line characterisation of microstructure and mechanical properties in the manufacturing of steel strip for the purpose of product uniformity con, {eid: 85029182269}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling innovation in campus networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <Outlier detection techniques for wireless sensor networks: A survey, {eid: 77955082590}>, <P4: Programming protocol-independent packet processors, {eid: 84905861611}>, <None, {eid: 85108297203}>, <None, {eid: 33845345317}>, <IEC 61499: Back to the well proven practice of IEC 61131?, {eid: 84876359222}>, <None, {eid: 84881178310}>, <NetSlices: Scalable multi-core packet processing in user-space, {eid: 84962239212}>, <PacketShader: A GPU-accelerated software router, {eid: 78149305172}>, <Santa: Faster packet delivery for commonly wished replies, {eid: 85070885862}>, <NetMap: A novel framework for fast packet I/O, {eid: 84869422868}>, <The BSD packet filter: A new architecture for user-level packet capture, {eid: 85077206746}>, <Demo: Towards in-network processing for low-latency industrial control, {eid: 85090495125}>, <Towards in-network industrial feedback control, {eid: 85056432829}>, <Symperf: Predicting network function performance, {eid: 85029674747}>, <Arbitrary packet matching in OpenFlow, {eid: 85045691393}>, <Tasklets:ŌĆØBetter than best-effortŌĆØ computing, {eid: 85108302073}>, <Quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for convexity, {eid: 80053166276}>, <A trust point-based security architecture for sensor data in the cloud, {eid: 84930362469}>, <Network security and privacy for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85048338526}>, <The 8 requirements of real-time stream processing, {eid: 31444440239}>, <Edge computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 84987842183}>, <Intelligent workload factoring for a hybrid cloud computing model, {eid: 72849118793}>, <Big data: Principles and best practices of scalable real-time data systems, {eid: 84959055122}>, <Streaming big data processing in datacenter clouds, {eid: 84961627543}>, <RDBMS to NoSQL: Reviewing some next-generation non-relational databases, {eid: 84877775758}>, <None, {eid: 85092746391}>, <Brewers conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services, {eid: 1542640153}>, <Perspectives on the cap theorem, {eid: 84869219414}>, <A survey of open source tools for machine learning with big data in the Hadoop ecosystem, {eid: 85013974691}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,1/8/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85108268408

All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

In this paper, we present the findings of a systematic literature review, consisting of quantitative and qualitative data, focusing on investigating to what extent, what type, and how academic publications on Industry 4.0 integrate human factors and ergonomics in their research. Based on these findings, we point to future research needs, highlighting the need for further empirical evidence and improved collaboration between the academic fields of Industry 4.0, human factors, and ergonomics, as well as with practitioners.","Cyber Physical Systems, Digitalization, Ergonomics, Human factors, Industry 4.0, Literature review",,,,,,,,"<The work system method: connecting people,

The IDS represents a multi-sided platform (MSP) for secure and trusted data exchange, which is governed by an institutionalized alliance of different stakeholder organizations. The paper delivers insights gained during the early stages of the platformŌĆÖs lifecycle (i.e. the platform design process). More specifically, it provides answers to three research questions, namely how alliance-driven MSPs come into existence and evolve, how different stakeholder groups use certain governance mechanisms during the platform design process, and how this process is influenced by regulatory instruments. By contrasting the case of an alliance-driven MSP with the more common approach of the keystone-driven MSP, the results of the case study suggest that different evolutionary paths can be pursued during the early stages of an MSPŌĆÖs lifecycle. Furthermore, the IDS initiative considers trust and data sovereignty more relevant regulatory instruments compared to pricing, for example. Finally, the study advances the body of scientific knowledge with regard to data being a boundary resource on MSPs.","Alliance-driven platform, Case study research, Data resource, Data sovereignty, International Data Spaces, Multi-sided data platform",,,,,,,,"<Ecosystem as structure, {eid: 85004107267, doi: 10.1177/0149206316678451}>, <The architecture of platforms: A unified view, {eid: 71949126345}>, <Investigating information systems with action research, {eid: 0002437413}>, <Developing multi-sided platforms for public-private information sharing, {eid: 84880563255}>, <Open platform strategies and innovation: granting access vs. devolving control, {eid: 77958033399, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.1100.1215}>, <Platform rules: multi-sided platforms as regulators, {eid: 77958062188}>, <Data Provenance: Some Basic Issues, {eid: 84947733945, doi: 10.1007/3-540-44450-5_6}>, <The evolution of platform thinking, {eid: 73649131660, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629189}>, <The role of platform boundary resources in software ecosystems: A case study, {eid: 84903734525}>, <The digital platform: a research agenda, {eid: 85018241471, doi: 10.1057/s41265-016-0033-3}>, <Defining architecture components of the big data ecosystem, {eid: 84906250101}>, <Generalizability and the single-case study, {eid: 0002228543}>, <None, {eid: 41849141359}>, <Distributed tuning of boundary resources: the case of Apples iOS service system, {eid: 84939781260, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2015/39.1.10}>, <Opening platforms: how, when and why?, {eid: 77958042047}>, <None, {eid: 85063569734}>, <The antitrust economics of multi-sided platform markets, {eid: 33846819331}>, <None, {eid: 84923304921, doi: 10.3386/w18783}>, <From databases to dataspaces, {eid: 31444453796, doi: 10.1145/1107499.1107502}>, <Platform dynamics and strategies: from products to services, {eid: 85040190478, doi: 10.4337/9781849803311}>, <Bridging differing perspectives on technological platforms: Toward an integrative framework, {eid: 84902550958, doi: 10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006}>, <Industry platforms and ecosystem innovation, {eid: 84898004011, doi: 10.1111/jpim.12105}>, <Governing third-party development through platform boundary resources, {eid: 84870963683}>, <A paradigmatic analysis of digital application marketplaces, {eid: 84939806687, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.16}>, <Context interchange: new features and formalisms for the intelligent integration of information, {eid: 0000876805, doi: 10.1145/314516.314520}>, <Two-sided platforms: product variety and pricing structures, {eid: 70350278738, doi: 10.1111/j.1530-9134.2009.00236.x}>, <Principles of dataspace systems, {eid: 34250660624}>, <VoCol: An Integrated Environment to Support Version-Controlled Vocabulary Development, {eid: 84997132390, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_20}>, <The generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution, {eid: 84887414769, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.3.11}>, <A Policy Language for Distributed Usage Control, {eid: 38049040380, doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-74835-9_35}>, <Requirements engineering as a success factor in software projects, {eid: 0035393371, doi: 10.1109/MS.2001.936219}>, <Requirements of an open data based business ecosystem, {eid: 84910094976, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2302872}>, <Data-centric intelligent information integrationŌĆöfrom concepts to automation, {eid: 84949106206, doi: 10.1007/s10844-014-0340-5}>, <Towards a policy enforcement infrastructure for distributed usage control, {eid: 84864041384}>, <Designing data governance, {eid: 73649138928, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629210}>, <Energy disclosure, market behavior, and the building data ecosystem, {eid: 84881546623, doi: 10.1111/nyas.12163}>, <None, {eid: 85050213166}>, <A review and future direction of agile, business intelligence, analytics and data science, {eid: 84966326638, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.04.013}>, <Towards a user-centric personal data ecosystem: The role of the bank of individuals data, {eid: 84871909125}>, <Management of the master data lifecycle: a framework for analysis, {eid: 84879700770, doi: 10.1108/JEIM-05-2013-0026}>, <The impact of openness on the market potential of multi-sided platforms: a case study of mobile payment platforms, {eid: 84939798226, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.7}>, <None, {eid: 85007218223}>, <None, {eid: 85020490036}>, <None, {eid: 85072047817}>, <Open source as enabler for OPC UA in industrial automation, {eid: 84952898892}>, <A design science research methodology for information systems research, {eid: 39749104751, doi: 10.2753/MIS0742-1222240302}>, <Distributed usage control, {eid: 33748543201, doi: 10.1145/1151030.1151053}>, <The theory contribution of case study research designs, {eid: 85050626091, doi: 10.1007/s40685-017-0045-z}>, <FIWARE Open Source Standard Platform in Smart Farming -

All rights reserved.Goal: The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of inserting a collaborative robot in a production line of a factory of the automotive sector. Design / Methodology / Approach: Two simulation environments were developed. The first one models the original operation without the collaborative robot. The second one evaluates the impact of inserting the robot. This work is quantitative. Results: The paper presents the use of digital manufacturing tools in a simulation of a collaborative operation between a human and a collaborative robot. The simulations with and without the collaborative robot were performed, and they make it possible to empha-size the benefits of the collaborative operation in a real production line. Limitations of the investigation: The first simulation scenario was validated from the real data provided by the factory. However, the second scenario is a suggestion, emphasizing the benefits of collaborative operation. Implementation of the second scenario was not conducted. Practical implications: Since its completion depended on support from the automotive sector, this work is noticeably practical. The real data used in the first scenario as well as the assumptions made in the second scenario allow one to conclude that it is possible to implement the propositions with the collaborative robot in the chosen line. Originality / Value: The use of the collaborative robot in Brazil was forbidden by regula-tion until recently. Even in other countries decision makers still find have difficulty decid-ing for this new technology. For this reason, the benefits of using collaborative robots, mainly in Brazilian companies, is still not clear. This work contributes to the collaborative robot discussion and consequently to Industry 4.0 implementation by creating a digital twin of an existing process and inserting a collaborative robot in it. The results should be used by decision makers to decide for inserting this technology in their factories.","Collaborative robotics, Digital manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Integration of a Skill-based Collaborative Mobile Robot in a Smart Cyber--physical Environment, {eid: 85029951065}>, <Formal model of human erroneous behavior for safety analysis in collaborative robotics, {eid: 85059693851}>, <Dynamic task classifica-tion and assignment for the management of human-robot collaborative teams in workcells, {eid: 85049641196}>, <Learning-based endovascular navigation through the use of non-rigid registration for collaborative robotic cathe-terization, {eid: 85045278827}>, <Interactive Simulation of Human-robot Collaboration Using a Force Feed-back Device, {eid: 85029889560}>, <Industrie 4.0: Hit or Hype?, {eid: 84903134983}>, <Language-free graphical signa-ge improves human performance and reduces anxiety when working collaboratively with robots, {eid: 85053812237}>, <Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios, {eid: 84975454820}>, <None, {eid: 0003884788}>, <None, {eid: 0004253213}>, <None, {eid: 85060532808}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Security framework for industrial collaborative robotic cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85042714903}>, <A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing sys-tems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Past, present and future of Industry 4.0-a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal, {eid: 85018651607}>, <A framework for human collaborative robots, operations in South African automotive industry, {eid: 84962018637}>, <Flexible programming and orchestration of collaborative robotic manufacturing systems, {eid: 85055563658}>, <None, {eid: 85147182923}>, <Application of mixed reality in robot manipulator programming, {eid: 85058018578}>, <Hu-man-oriented design of collaborative robots, {eid: 85007487613}>, <How connectivity and search for producers impact production in industry 4.0 networks, {eid: 85095680577}>, <Industry 4.0: glitter or gold?

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.","Data fusion, digital twin (DT), industry application, modeling",,,,,,,,"<Smart manufacturing must

We claim that these directions can be effectively and efficiently addressed through the adoption of innovative quality-aware edge cloud computing platforms for the design, implementation, and runtime support of distributed AI solutions that execute on both global cloud resources and edge nodes in industrial plant premises. In particular, the paper presents the first experiences that we are doing within the framework of the H2020 Innovation Action IoTwins, for the implementation and optimization of distributed hybrid twins in the IIoT application domains of predictive maintenance and manufacturing optimization. IoTwins exploits distributed hybrid twins, partly executing at edge cloud nodes in industrial plant localities, to perform process/fault predictions and manufacturing line reconfigurations under time constraints, also by enabling some forms of sovereignty on industrial monitoring data. In addition, the paper overviews our original taxonomy of the stateof-the-art research literature about distributed AI for decentralized learning, with specific focus on federated settings and on emerging trends for the IIoT domain.","Decentralized Learning, Distributed Digital Twins, Edge Cloud Computing, Industrial Internet of Things, IoTwins",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075919336}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <ERDT: Energy-efficient reliable decision transmission for intelligent cooperative spectrum sensing in industrial lot, {eid: 84961080078}>, <A development approach for collective opportunistic Edge-of-Things services, {eid: 85066250704}>, <The Promise of Edge Computing, {eid: 84969922595}>, <None, {eid: 85075912345}>, <Enabling smart cities through a cognitive management framework for the internet of things, {eid: 84879097737}>, <None, {eid: 85075950973}>, <None, {eid: 85075942628}>, <None, {eid: 85070075435}>, <None, {eid: 85075946335}>, <None, {eid: 85075908970}>, <Large scale distributed deep networks, {eid: 84877760312}>, <Deep learning with elastic averaging SGD, {eid: 84965152276}>, <None, {eid: 85011018077}>, <None, {eid: 85037742095}>, <None, {eid: 85071319404}>, <None, {eid: 84997445201}>, <Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis, {eid: 33745556605}>, <Our data, ourselves: Privacy via distributed noise generation, {eid: 33746037200}>, <The algorithmic foundations of differential privacy, {eid: 84905991151}>, <Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data, {eid: 85083937116}>, <None, {eid: 85064803536}>, <Deep Models under the GAN: Information leakage from collaborative deep learning, {eid: 85041437863}>, <None, {eid: 85072921653}>, <None, {eid: 85050988696}>, <None, {eid: 85060311764}>, <Practical secure aggregation for privacy-preserving machine learning, {eid: 85041432607}>, <Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning via Additively Homomorphic Encryption, {eid: 85040063992}>, <None, {eid: 85061175448}>, <None, {eid: 85075934363}>, <None, {eid: 85075954814}>, <None, {eid: 85072559936}>, <None, {eid: 85061192207}>, <None, {eid: 85072110535}>, <None, {eid: 85045348132}>, <None, {eid: 85084160327}>, <CPSGD: Communication-efficient and differentially-private distributed SGD, {eid: 85064805388}>, <None, {eid: 85075914667}>, <None, {eid: 85073230150}>, <None, {eid: 85075921960}>, <None, {eid: 85075923069}>, <Gossip learning as a decentralized alternative to federated learning.

Such systems help reduce complexity for operators by automating data integration tasks and recommending actions. However, these systems are sometimes flawed. It is not sufficiently understood whether, when and why operators comply with such systems in erroneous or correct cases. We empirically investigate compliance with correct and defective DSSs, the influence of correct and erroneous DSS's on performance and subjective factors related to compliance. In the study, a business game was used as an experimental setting in which 40 users took part. The impact of system correctness on user acceptance, trust, compliance and overall performance was investigated. The results show that the defective system reduces trust in automation (ŌłÆ47%), reduces usefulness (ŌłÆ58%), reduces acceptance (ŌłÆ62%) and reduces overall performance (ŌłÆ32%). Overall, the defective system was less user-friendly (ŌłÆ27%). Nevertheless, users who rated the system's usability higher, outperformed users who rated it lower. Usability is therefore an intermediary that compensates for the negative influence of erroneous DSSs.","automation bias, business simulation game, Decision support system, supply chain management, technology acceptance, trust in automation, usability",,,,,,,,"<The Theory of Planned Behavior, {eid: 44949274046, doi: 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}>, <Understanding Age Differences in PDA Acceptance and Performance, {eid: 34249947611, doi: 10.1016/j.chb.2006.06.005}>, <Ironies of Automation, {eid: 0020843464, doi: 10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8}>, <Self-Efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency, {eid: 33746878674, doi: 10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122}>, <Kontroll├╝berzeugungen im Umgang mit Technik Locus of Control when Interacting with Technology, {eid: 0345388189}>, <The Efficacy of Business Simulation Games in Creating Decision Support Systems: An Experimental Investigation, {eid: 76849117289, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2010.01.002}>, <Measuring the Perceived Effectiveness of Decision Support Systems and their Impact on Performance, {eid: 84868640683, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.033}>, <An Empirically Derived Agenda of Critical Research Issues for Managing Supply-Chain Disruptions, {eid: 27844542118, doi: 10.1080/00207540500151549}>, <The Future of Construction Automation: Technological Disruption and the Upcoming Ubiquity of Robotics, {eid: 84944442053, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.022}>, <None, {eid: 84978863655}>, <None, {eid: 85075090527}>, <A Game-Based Approach to Meet the Challenges of Decision Processes in Ramp-Up Management, {eid: 84958191101, doi: 10.1080/10686967.2016.11918462}>, <None, {eid: 84986277922}>, <None, {eid: 85062367303}>, <None, {eid: 85062329889}>, <How Virtualization, Decentralization and Network Building Change the Manufacturing Landscape: An Industry 4.0 Perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction, {eid: 84948512218, doi: 10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2}>, <Evaluating AmazonS Mechanical Turk as a Tool for Experimental Behavioral Research, {eid: 84874841717, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057410}>, <The New Statistics: Why and How, {eid: 84891940182, doi: 10.1177/0956797613504966}>, <Automated Decision Making Comes of Age, {eid: 23444456914}>, <Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology, {eid: 55249087535, doi: 10.2307/249008}>, <Simulation Games in Engineering Education: A State-of-the-Art Review, {eid: 78149303408, doi: 10.1002/cae.20323}>, <The Effects of Errors on System Trust, Self-Confidence, and the Allocation of Control in Route Planning, {eid: 0038615897, doi: 10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00039-9}>, <None, {eid: 0032689906}>, <None, {eid: 0004278738}>, <Towards Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems in Production Networks, {eid: 84883852241, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2013.05.009}>, <Effects of Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems on Practitioner Performance and Patient Outcomes: A Systematic Review, {eid: 14544305532, doi: 10.1001/jama.293.10.1223}>, <None, {eid: 0003718482}>, <Automation Bias: A systematic Review of Frequency, Effect Mediators, and Mitigators, {eid: 84856788472, doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089}>, <None, {eid: 0003398482}>, <A Framework For Management Information Systems, {eid: 0002959189}>, <Foundations for an Empirically Determined Scale of Trust in Automated System, {eid: 0001803767, doi: 10.1207/S15327566IJCE0401_04}>, <The Role of Human Factors in Agile Supply Chains, {eid: 57349097261, doi: 10.1504/EJIE.2009.021582}>, <On Effect Size, {eid: 84866442229, doi: 10.1037/a0028086}>, <Managing Disruption Risks in Global Supply Chains, {eid: 19844381688, doi: 10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00009.x}>, <None, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect, {eid: 0031108822, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.43.4.546}>, <Trust in Automation: Designing for Appropriate Reliance, {eid: 85010007963, doi: 10.1518/hfes.46.1.50.30392}>, <The Role of Absorptive Capacity, Communication and Trust in ERP Adoption, {eid: 84973925883, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2016.05.025}>, <None, {eid: 85062326574}>, <Cyber-Physical Production Systems: Roots, Expectations and R&D Challenges, {eid: 84904510850, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2014.03.115}>, <Chapter 10: Human Decision Makers and Automated Decision Aids: Made for Each Other?, {eid: 85052397348}>, <Trust in Automation.

This raises a gap between the generic modeling languages and the domains of experience of the engineers using these. Engineering truly domain-specific languages (DSLs) for experts of these domains still is too challenging for their wide-spread adoption. One major obstacle, the inability to reuse multi-dimensional (encapsulating constituents of syntax and semantics) language components in a black-box fashion, prevents the effective engineering of novel DSLs. To facilitate engineering DSLs, we devised a concept of 3D components for textual, external, and translational DSLs that relies on systematic reuse through systematic closed and open variability in which DSL syntaxes can be embedded, well-formedness rules joined, and code generators integrated in a black-box fashion. We present this concept, a method for its systematic application, an integrated collection of modeling languages supporting systematic language reuse, and an extensible framework that leverages these languages to derive novel DSLs from language product lines. These can greatly mitigate many of the challenges in DSL reuse and, hence, can advance the engineering of truly domain-specific modeling languages.","DSL, modeling language, reuse, variability",,,,,,,,"<Feature models, grammars, and propositional formulas, {eid: 33646190894}>, <Functional modelling and simulation of overall system ship-virtual methods for engineering and commissioning in shipbuilding, {eid: 84938682810}>, <None, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Variability management with feature models, {eid: 5144222844}>, <The smach high-level executive, {eid: 78650257169}>, <Controlled and extensible variability of concrete and abstract syntax with independent language features, {eid: 85044388976}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <Systematic composition of independent language features, {eid: 85062348521}>, <Modeling reusable, platform-independent robot assembly processes, {eid: 85071365924}>, <Neverlang 2-componentised language development for the jvm, {eid: 84883342791}>, <Variability within modeling language de?nitions, {eid: 77249172339}>, <Conceptual model of the globalization for domain-speci?c languages, {eid: 84951875201}>, <Concern-oriented language development (cold): Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 84958237938}>, <Mind the gap: Lessons learned from translating grammars between monticore and xtext, {eid: 85077180479}>, <Melange: A meta-language for modular and reusable development of dsls, {eid: 84962587279}>, <Automating generation of the assembly line models in aircraft manufacturing simulation, {eid: 84890853908}>, <Xtext-implement your language faster than the quick and dirty way, {eid: 78650158701}>, <Towards e?ective management of inconsistencies in model-based engineering of automated production systems, {eid: 84953867216}>, <None, {eid: 85052020111}>, <The aadl behaviour annex-experiments and roadmap, {eid: 44149092088}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <Using state machines for a model driven development of web service-based sensor network applications, {eid: 77955827775}>, <A comparison of mechanisms for integrating handwritten and generated code for object-oriented programming languages, {eid: 84939532216}>, <None, {eid: 50949102921}>, <Meaningful modeling: Whats the semantics of ""semantics""?, {eid: 7244261750}>, <Integrating ocl and textual modelling languages, {eid: 79957644161}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Software language engineering in the large: Towards composing and deriving languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <Semantic virtual factory supporting interoperable modelling and evaluation of production systems, {eid: 84878842766}>, <Vcu: The three dimensions of reuse, {eid: 84977507448}>, <None, {eid: 67649962577}>, <Choosy and picky: Con?guration of language product lines, {eid: 84982855913}>, <Technological spaces: An initial appraisal, {eid: 18144421716}>, <None, {eid: 84919732308}>, <Feature-oriented language families: A case study, {eid: 84921051501}>, <Gramosa framework for graphical modelling and simulation-based analysis of complex production processes, {eid: 84942371630}>, <None, {eid: 85096984750}>, <None, {eid: 84949846008}>, <Model-based design process for the early phases of manufacturing system planning using sysml, {eid: 85019992214}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Abstract features in feature modeling, {eid: 80054080510}>, <Metaedit+: De?ning and using integrated domain-speci?c modeling languages, {eid: 72249095680}>, <Neverlang: A framework for feature-oriented language development, {eid: 84938739142}>, <Language modularization and composition with projectional language workbenches illustrated with mps, {eid: 81455159767}>, <Language extension and composition with language workbenches, {eid: 78650085881}>, <Language design with the spoofax language workbench, {eid: 84907989410}>, <Improving domain-speci?c language reuse with software product line techniques, {eid: 67650445765}>, <Modeling languages in industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>, <Domain-speci?c metamodelling languages for software language engineering, {eid: 77951542786}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,10/18/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096955321

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud/edge computing integration.

There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.","Digital Twin, Virtual

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

However, securely setting up OPC UA, the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate configuration for security-featuring protocols.","industrial communication, network security, security configuration",,,,,,,,"<Mission accomplished?

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Injection molding, Model-driven development, Reference architecture",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Digital behavioral twins for safe connected cars, {eid: 85056832496}>, <Machinability assessment of inconel 718 by factorial design of experiment coupled with response surface methodology, {eid: 0343168164}>, <Practical applications of Taguchi method for optimization of processing parameters for plastic injection moulding: A retrospective review, {eid: 84923316802}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Constance: an intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <Injection molding setup by means of machine learning based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85072959161}>, <Combined learning processes for injection moulding based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85097342280}>, <Flexibilisation of injection moulding manufacture through digitisation, {eid: 85086233825}>, <Approaches of self-optimising systems in manufacturing, {eid: 85149036760}>, <None, {eid: 85086227181}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85054903830}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <None, {eid: 84905811248}>, <Abstraction and refinement in hierarchically decomposable and underspecified CPS-architectures, {eid: 85052702289}>, <Jenseits menschlicher f├żhigkeiten.

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.","cyber-physical systems, digital twins, information systems, model-driven software engineering, software architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85096954089}>, <None, {eid: 85085475406}>, <None,

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELSŌĆÖ17), IEEE, pp 281ŌĆō291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.","Industry 4.0, Modeling languages, Smart

While adaptability is vastly increased, these more dynamic associations necessitate more extensive data sharing among different stakeholders while simultaneously overturning previously established levels of trust. Hence, manufacturers' demand to track goods and to investigate root causes of issues across their supply chains becomes more challenging to satisfy within these now untrusted environments. Complementarily, suppliers need to keep any data irrelevant to such routine checks secret to remain competitive. To bridge the needs of contractors and suppliers in increasingly flexible supply chains, we thus propose to establish a privacy-preserving and distributed multi-hop accountability log among the involved stakeholders based on Attribute-based Encryption and backed by a blockchain. Our large-scale feasibility study is motivated by a real-world manufacturing process, i.e., a fine blanking line, and reveals only modest costs for multi-hop tracing and tracking of goods.","Attribute-based encryption, Blockchain, Internet of Production, Multi-hop tracking and tracing, Supply chain",,,,,,,,"<The impact of supply chain integration on performance: A contingency and configuration approach, {eid: 71349087209}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85075007871}>, <Dataflow challenges in an internet of production: A security & privacy perspective, {eid: 85075014511}>, <Security considerations for collaborations in an industrial iot-based lab of labs, {eid: 85083694152}>, <A journey in applying blockchain for cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85082175369}>, <The collaborative supply chain, {eid: 84992930161}>, <Information sharing as a coordination mechanism for reducing the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, {eid: 34247280386}>, <Building successful logistics partnerships, {eid: 0012566419}>, <Collaborative supply chain management: The most promising practice for building efficient and sustainable supply chains, {eid: 34249789030}>, <Digital supply chain transformation toward blockchain integration, {eid: 85061159764}>, <Blockchain in logistics and supply chain: Trick or treat?, {eid: 85044348960}>, <Do you need a blockchain?, {eid: 85058290284}>, <Productchain: Scalable blockchain framework to support provenance in supply chains, {eid: 85113258875}>, <Trustchain: Trust management in blockchain and iot supported supply chains, {eid: 85078703339}>, <Blockchain ready manufacturing supply chain using distributed ledger, {eid: 85028593103}>, <Toward an ontology-driven blockchain design for supply-chain provenance, {eid: 85044518392}>, <Blockchain-based supply chain traceability: Token recipes model manufacturing processes, {eid: 85067872571}>, <Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84857214669}>, <Decentralizing attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84864536476}>, <Cryptographic cloud storage, {eid: 84988890715}>, <Towards secure mobile cloud computing: A survey, {eid: 84866668858}>, <Easier: Encryption-based access control in social networks with efficient revocation, {eid: 84863649032}>, <Security and privacy in smart health: Efficient policy-hiding attribute-based access control, {eid: 85045344537}>, <Smart contract-based car insurance policies, {eid: 85076109663}>, <Adaptable key-policy attribute-based encryption with time interval, {eid: 84975129943}>, <Charm: A framework for rapidly prototyping cryptosystems, {eid: 84881234170}>, <None, {eid: 85090266623}>, <None, {eid: 85071622151}>, <None, {eid: 85075916236}>, <None, {eid: 85070610572}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <None, {eid: 2342639859}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85090159235

This paper aims to identify perspectives, principles and prospects of production logistics visibility (PLV). The study is based on a literature review of articles presenting definitions, development trends and the future role of PLV. It is concluded that visibility is generally defined by availability, quality, accessibility and usefulness of information. PLV could refer to the extent to which actors within the production systems have access to timely and accurate information considered useful to their operations. According to the findings, antecedents of PLV include digitalisation, IoT and connectivity. These steps are required to turn data into meaningful information that can be used for decision making in production and logistics setting to improve operational and business performance. Furthermore, to fully benefit from PLV, there has to be an integration of external and internal perspectives. Concluding, the paper defines future research efforts including four lines of exploration and development: (1) Intra-site visibility for material management including dynamic synchronisation, takt and resource planning. (2) Supply-oriented visibility for dynamic status and prediction of supply network status. These two initial lines of enquiry should include the perspectives of stakeholders, parameter, enabling technologies and potential impact. (3) A synthesised framework for Production Logistics Visibility, relying on utilizing antecedents and enabling multi-criteria decision in production logistics based on visibility, where performance in terms of efficiency, sustainability and flexibility is ensured. (4) To specifically detail and exploit the potential in production logistics visibility in the aspect of environmental sustainability and closed material and product loops.","Digitalization, Production logistics, Supply Chain, Visibility",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85182103068}>, <Digital supply chain transformation: Visualizing the possibilities, {eid: 85098647439}>, <Conducting a literature review, {eid: 84993029626}>, <None, {eid: 85182109660}>, <CIRP Nomenclature and Definitions for Manufacturing Systems (English Language Version), {eid: 0347367819}>, <Exploring internal and external supply chain linkages: Evidence from the field, {eid: 79955068420}>, <Leveraging supply chain visibility for responsiveness: The moderating role of internal integration, {eid: 84887009587}>, <Supply chain practice and information sharing, {eid: 34547682716}>, <Managing product quality risk and visibility in multi-layer supply chain, {eid: 84863186409}>, <Information-sharing in supply chains: Five proposals on how to proceed, {eid: 84986156114}>, <Defining and assessing requisite supply chain visibility in regulated industries, {eid: 84877825051}>, <An empirical investigation of supply chain strategy typologies and relationships to performance, {eid: 51749125229}>, <Information visibility non differentiated products, {eid: 0036489962}>, <Improving supply chain performance through improved visibility, {eid: 84986105967}>, <Performance measurement in a supply chain, {eid: 0038046206}>, <The effect of controversial global sourcing practices on ethical judgements and intentions of US consumers, {eid: 84939944218}>, <The value of sharing planning information in supply chains, {eid: 84878249883}>, <Antecedents of supply chain visibility in retail supply chains: A resource-based theory perspective, {eid: 34548713468}>, <None, {eid: 84982208424}>, <Improving supply chain visibility using iot-internet of things, {eid: 85063897267}>, <A Hybrid Blockchain Ledger for Supply Chain Visibility, {eid: 85053935830}>, <None, {eid: 85063867101}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility and supply chain performance, {eid: 84897115235}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility in buyer-supplier relationshps: The case of telecommunication equipment component manufacturing industry, {eid: 79953161073}>, <Supply chain visibility: A decision making perspective, {eid: 70349320049}>, <The benefits of supply chain visibility: A value assessment model, {eid: 84896361906}>, <An investigation of visibility and flexibility as complements to supply chain analytics: An organizational information processing theory perspective, {eid: 85026783047}>, <Characterizing supply chain visibility-A literature review, {eid: 85042486901}>, <Does supply chain visibility affect operating performance?-Evidence from conflict minerals disclosures, {eid: 85064002720}>, <Sustainability-related supply chain risks: Conceptualization and management, {eid: 84896395922}>, <Extending the supply chain visibility boundry, Utilizing stakeholders for identifying supply chain sustainability risks, {eid: 85009446793}>, <Role-Tailored map dashboards-A new approach for enhancing the forest-based supply chain, {eid: 85061348901}>, <None, {eid: 85084767126}>",,,IOS Press BV,,,10/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85098635883

To allow for dynamic relationships along supply chains, we propose a blockchain-backed supply chain monitoring architecture relying on trusted hardware. Our design provides a notion of secure end-to-end sensing of interactions even when originating from untrusted surroundings. Due to attested checkpointing, we can identify misinformation early on and reliably pinpoint the origin. A blockchain enables long-term verifiability for all (now trustworthy) IoT data within our system even if issues are detected only after the fact. Our feasibility study and cost analysis further show that our design is indeed deployable in and applicable to today's supply chain settings.","blockchain, condition monitoring, Internet of Production, supply chain, trusted computing, trusted execution",,,,,,,,"<A journey in applying blockchain for cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85082175369}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85075007871}>, <Dataflow challenges in an internet of production: A security & privacy perspective, {eid: 85075014511}>, <The quest for secure and privacy-preserving cloud-based industrial cooperation, {eid: 85090130663}>, <The road to accountable and dependable manufacturing, {eid: 85090132287}>, <IIoTEED: An enhanced, trusted execution environment for industrial IoT edge devices, {eid: 85012295286}>, <Authentic execution of distributed event-driven applications with a small TCB, {eid: 85090140716}>, <Hardware-based trusted computing architectures for isolation and attestation, {eid: 85041899586}>, <An overview of blockchain technology: Architecture, consensus, and future trends, {eid: 85019665012}>, <Innovative instructions and software model for isolated execution, {eid: 84893423195}>, <Demystifying arm trustzone: A comprehensive survey, {eid: 85061207964}>, <Sancus 2.0: A low-cost security architecture for IoT devices, {eid: 85032639589}>, <Decentralizing privacy: Using blockchain to protect personal data, {eid: 85032354587}>, <VulCAN: Efficient component authentication and software isolation for automotive control networks, {eid: 85056874663}>, <A tale of two worlds: Assessing the vulnerability of enclave shielding runtimes, {eid: 85075919749}>, <Low cost attacks on tamper resistant devices, {eid: 0000694402}>, <Differential power analysis, {eid: 0000474763}>, <Do you need a Blockchain?, {eid: 85058290284}>, <None, {eid: 85090136045}>, <Authentication of 3d printed parts using 3d physical signatures, {eid: 85076116297}>, <Towards industrial internet of things: Crankshaft monitoring, traceability and tracking using RFID, {eid: 84959472615}>, <None, {eid: 85090118525}>, <Blockchain ready manufacturing supply chain using distributed ledger, {eid: 85028593103}>, <Private multi-hop accountability for supply chains, {eid: 85090159235}>, <CCF: A framework for building confidential verifiable replicated services, {eid: 85090161728}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/29/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85090158616

However, with the shift toward more dynamic and flexible supply chains, privacy concerns severely challenge the required information retrieval. A lack of trust between the different involved stakeholders inhibits advanced, multi-hop information flows, as valuable information for tracking and tracing products and parts is either unavailable or only retained locally. Our extensive literature review of previous approaches shows that these needs for cross-company information retrieval are widely acknowledged, but related work currently only addresses them insufficiently. To overcome these concerns, we present PrivAccIChain, a secure, privacy-preserving architecture for improving the multi-hop information retrieval with stakeholder accountability along supply chains. To address use case-specific needs, we particularly introduce an adaptable configuration of transparency and data privacy within our design. Hence, we enable the benefits of information sharing as well as multi-hop tracking and tracing even in supply chains that include mutually distrusting stakeholders. We evaluate the performance of PrivAccIChain and demonstrate its real-world feasibility based on the information of a purchasable automobile, the e.GO Life. We further conduct an in-depth security analysis and propose tunable mitigations against common attacks. As such, we attest PrivAccIChain's practicability for information management even in complex supply chains with flexible and dynamic business relationships.","Attribute-based encryption, e.GO,

Building on literature in moral and legal philosophy, and ethics of technology, the paper proposes a broader and more comprehensive analysis of the responsibility gap. The responsibility gap, it is argued, is not one problem but a set of at least four interconnected problems ŌĆō gaps in culpability, moral and public accountability, active responsibilityŌĆöcaused by different sources, some technical, other organisational, legal, ethical, and societal. Responsibility gaps may also happen with non-learning systems. The paper clarifies which aspect of AI may cause which gap in which form of responsibility, and why each of these gaps matter. It proposes a critical review of partial and non-satisfactory attempts to address the responsibility gap: those which present it as a new and intractable problem (ŌĆ£fatalismŌĆØ), those which dismiss it as a false problem (ŌĆ£deflationismŌĆØ), and those which reduce it to only one of its dimensions or sources and/or present it as a problem that can be solved by simply introducing new technical and/or legal tools (ŌĆ£solutionismŌĆØ). The paper also outlines a more comprehensive approach to address the responsibility gaps with AI in their entirety, based on the idea of designing socio-technical systems for ŌĆ£meaningful human control"", that is systems aligned with the relevant human reasons and capacities.","AI and accountability, AI ethics, Engineer responsibility, Meaningful human control, Responsibility gap",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85097864150}>, <Article 36, {eid: 85105924887}>, <A body to kick, but still no soul to damn: Legal perspectives on robotics, {eid: 84876855637}>, <None, {eid: 85104771203}>, <Fatal U.S, {eid: 85105964370}>, <).

This article explores the impact of design factors of the robotic interface (anthropomorphic vs functional) and usage context (production vs care) on human-robot trust and attributions. Theresults of a scenario-based survey with N = 228 N=228 participants showed a higher willingness to collaborate with production robots compared to care. Context and design influenced the trust attributed to the robots: robots with a technical appearance in production were trusted more than anthropomorphic robots or robots in the care context. The evaluation of attributions by means of a semanticdifferential showed that differences in robot design were less pronounced for the production context in comparison to the care context. In the latter, anthropomorphic robots were associated with positive attributes. The results contribute to a better understanding of the complex nature of trust in automation and can be used to identify and shape use case-specific risk perceptions as well as perceived opportunities to interacting with collaborative robots. Findings of this study are pertinent to research (e.g., experts in human-robot interaction) and industry, with special regard given tothe technical development and design.","assistance robotics, attribution, collaborative robotics, human-robot collaboration, human-robot interaction, semantic differential, technology acceptance, trust in automation",,,,,,,,"<""human-robot collaboration: A survey,"", {eid: 84938150940}>, <""world Population Prospects 2019.

Such deployments rely on the flexibility and scalability of systems and devices. Heterogeneous systems need to be interoperable and work together seamlessly. In order to manage such system of systems, it is important to work with a framework that not only supports the flexible nature of IoT systems but also provides adequate support for industrial requirements, such as real-time and runtime features, architectural approaches, hardware constraints, standardization, industrial support, interoperability, and security. The selection of an appropriate framework results difficult due to the rising number of available frameworks and platforms, which offer different support for the aforementioned requirements. Therefore, this article investigates the features of seven prominent frameworks for the purpose of simplifying the selection of a suitable framework for an industrial application. The aim of this article is to present the recent developments and state-of-the-art of industrial IoT frameworks and provide a technical comparison of their features and characteristics.","Frameworks, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), system of systems (SoS)",,,,,,,,"<The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): An analysis framework, {eid: 85047947260}>, <Industrial Internet of Things:Challenges, opportunities, and directions, {eid: 85049358359}>, <Internet of Things: Architectures, protocols, and applications, {eid: 85012191658}>, <Internet of Things security: A survey, {eid: 85017561368}>, <A survey on Internet of Things architectures, {eid: 85005952241}>, <None, {eid: 85028362968}>, <Botnets and Internet of Things security, {eid: 85012917393}>, <Integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things:Asurvey, {eid: 84958935292}>, <A review of Internet of Things for smart home: Challenges and solutions, {eid: 85028237634}>, <5G Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 85044977720}>, <Asurvey of commercial frameworks for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84952907595}>, <Internet of Things: A survey on the security of IoT frameworks, {eid: 85034956984}>, <None, {eid: 85102737302}>, <None, {eid: 85052594100}>, <Enabling IoT automation using local clouds, {eid: 85015159190}>, <The arrowhead approach for SOA application development and documentation, {eid: 84949513541}>, <None, {eid: 85102769386}>, <None, {eid: 85102753982}>, <None, {eid: 85102741758}>, <None, {eid: 85102771044}>, <None, {eid: 85102739571}>, <None, {eid: 85080705565}>, <None, {eid: 85102775737}>, <None, {eid: 85102737148}>, <None, {eid: 85072047817}>, <Industrial data space architecture implementation using fiware, {eid: 85050079149}>, <None, {eid: 85075886677}>, <None, {eid: 85102727200}>, <None, {eid: 85102747812}>, <None, {eid: 85102760084}>, <None, {eid: 85102765136}>, <None, {eid: 85102743283}>, <None, {eid: 85102739047}>, <None, {eid: 85066052205}>, <None, {eid: 85102757742}>, <None, {eid: 85086592325}>, <None, {eid: 85102746713}>, <None, {eid: 85068842505}>, <None, {eid: 85102760351}>, <None, {eid: 85102748915}>, <None, {eid: 85102756628}>, <Local cloud Internet of Things automation: Technology and business model features of distributed Internet of Things automation solutions, {eid: 85040319910}>, <Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Future modeling and simulation of CPS-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563}>, <Middleware for Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 84959420432}>, <Arrowhead framework core systems and services, {eid: 85052570810}>, <None, {eid: 85102734647}>, <None, {eid: 85102778739}>, <None, {eid: 85102746117}>, <Autonomous production workstation operation, reconfiguration and synchronization, {eid: 85082752789}>, <None, {eid: 85102734564}>, <None, {eid: 85065678373}>, <None, {eid: 85102759640}>, <None, {eid: 85102756754}>, <None, {eid: 85102734679}>, <Terminology for constrainednode networks, {eid: 84978048918}>, <None, {eid: 85102725658}>, <None, {eid: 85102761502}>, <Quality of service on the arrowhead framework, {eid: 85033563877}>, <None, {eid: 85102774711}>, <None, {eid: 85102770713}>, <None, {eid: 85102729659}>, <None, {eid: 85102739053}>, <None, {eid: 85102760024}>, <None, {eid: 85102750264}>, <None, {eid: 85102744060}>, <None, {eid: 85102765431}>, <None, {eid: 85102761297}>, <Interoperability, {eid: 0001649084}>, <None, {eid: 66149130951}>, <A systematic review to merge discourses: Interoperability, integration and cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85044008633}>, <None, {eid: 85102739053}>, <Flow based security for IoT devices using an SDN gateway, {eid: 84992111597}>, <Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and security issues, {eid: 85034595585}>, <An AAA solution for securing industrial IoT devices using next generation access control, {eid: 85050142256}>, <None, {eid: 85102779670}>, <None, {eid: 85100131028}>, <None, {eid: 85102756586}>, <None, {eid: 85102769257}>, <None, {eid: 85102763738}>, <None, {eid: 85102739219}>, <None, {eid: 85102770902}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,3/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85102736071
100.0,,,,Development of manufacturing execution systems in accordance with industry 4. 0 requirements: A review of standard-and ontologybased methodologies and tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This work presents how recent trends in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) solutions are influencing the development of manufacturing execution systems (MESs) and analyzes what kinds of trends will determine the development of the next generation of these technologies. This systematic and thematic review provides a detailed analysis of I4.0-related requirements in terms of MES functionalities and an overview of MES development methods and standards because these three aspects are essential in developing MESs. The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information. The presented overview can serve as a guide for engineers interested in the development of MESs as well as for researchers interested in finding worthwhile areas of research.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85090014332
105.0,,,,"Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85077515399
119.0,,,,The applications of industry 4. 0 technologies in manufacturing context: A systematic literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Industry 4.0 (I4.0) encompasses a plethora of digital technologies effecting on manufacturing enterprises. Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85093949784
