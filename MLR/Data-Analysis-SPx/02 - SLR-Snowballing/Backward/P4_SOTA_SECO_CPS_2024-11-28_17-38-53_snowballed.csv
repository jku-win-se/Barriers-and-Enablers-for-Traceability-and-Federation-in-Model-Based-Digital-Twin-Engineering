All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

Open source technology can comprise of software, hardware and hybrid solutions that nowadays drive Smart Manufacturing. The major potential of open source technology in Smart Manufacturing lies in enabling interoperability and in reducing the capital costs of designing and implementing new manufacturing solutions. After presenting our motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes with research questions to be addressed in the future.","Digital Twin, micro-services architecture, open source technology, Smart CPS",,,,,,,,"<A Semantic-Based Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) Discovery and Selection System, {eid: 84893669179, doi: 10.1177/1753193412446112}>, <Characterization of Hadoop Jobs Using Unsupervised Learning, {eid: 79952469495, doi: 10.1109/CloudCom.2010.20}>, <Ontology-Based Reconfiguration Agent for Intelligent Mechatronic Systems in Flexible Manufacturing, {eid: 77955665456, doi: 10.1016/j.rcim.2009.12.001}>, <A Systematic Approach to Developing Ontologies for Manufacturing Service Modeling, {eid: 84893737237, doi: 10.1094/PDIS-11-11-0999-PDN}>, <Learning Significant Locations and Predicting User Movement with GPS, {eid: 84952004685, doi: 10.1109/ISWC.2002.1167224}>, <Using GPS to Learn Significant Locations and Predict Movement across Multiple Users, {eid: 84875644869, doi: 10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0}>, <Ontology-Driven Adaptive Sensor Networks.

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,9/25/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these new concepts is the Digital Twin, which recently started gaining momentum, and is related to creating a virtual copy of the physical system, providing a connection between the real and virtual systems to collect and analyze and simulate data in the virtual model to improve the performance of the real system. The benefits of using the digital twin approach is attracting significant attention and interest from research and industry communities in the last few years, and its importance will increase in the upcoming years. Having this in mind, this paper surveys and discusses the digital twin concept in the context of the 4th industrial revolution, particularly focusing the concept and functionalities, the associated technologies, the industrial applications and the research challenges. The applicability of the digital concept is illustrated by the virtualisation of an UR3 collaborative robot which used the V-REP simulation environment and the Modbus communication protocol.","Digital Twin, Industry 4.0, Simulation, Virtualisation",,,,,,,,"<Securing the future of German manufacturing industry: Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4. 0, {eid: 84926018987}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063}>, <None, {eid: 84940453073}>, <None, {eid: 85079049535}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Predictive manufacturing system-trends of next-generation production systems, {eid: 85079047775}>, <Product avatar as digital counterpart of a physical individual product: Literature review and implications in an aircraft, {eid: 84975691204}>, <Innovations in digital modelling for next generation manufacturing system design, {eid: 85018625620}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <None, {eid: 85070599797}>, <None, {eid: 85079035130}>, <Feasibility of an immersive digital twin, {eid: 85079069337}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Industry 4. 0 and the power of the digital twin, {eid: 85028754996}>, <Digital twins speed up the commissioning process, {eid: 85079053004}>, <None, {eid: 85079065371}>, <None, {eid: 85079052784}>, <None, {eid: 85079045921}>, <None, {eid: 85079055642}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85079066400}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,7/22/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079042229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.","Data fusion, digital twin (DT), industry application, modeling",,,,,,,,"<Smart manufacturing must

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry.","digital twin, internet of things, machine learning, petrochemical industry, production control

To parallelize event processing and produce near-real-Time insights over data streams, Digital Twin should be implemented based on an Event-Driven architecture. The Event-Driven architecture is loosely-coupled by its nature. One of the recent possible solutions for loose coupling system is a Microservice approach, a cohesive and independent process that interacts using messages. Stateless behavior is the nature of the microservice, but on the other hand, the vast majority of stream processing in Digital Twin imply stateful operations. Thus, in this paper, we propose a case-study of the possibility to use Apache Kafka Stream API (Kafka stream DSL) to build stateful microservice for real-Time manufacturing data analysis. Also, in the presented work we discuss the fulfillment of such requirements as fault tolerance, processing latency, and scalability to support the stateful stream processing in Digital Twins implementation.","Apache Kafka, Digital Twin, Event-Driven, Microservice, Sensors, Stream processing",,,,,,,,"<Impact of Quality of Service on Cloud Based Industrial IoT Applications with OPC UA, {eid: 85050353024}>, <The Ring Buffer Network Bus (RBNB) DataTurbine Streaming Data Middleware for Environmental Observing Systems, {eid: 44949167512}>, <IoT-Based Intelligent Perception and Access of Manufacturing Resource Toward Cloud Manufacturing, {eid: 84896964757}>, <Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0: Final report of the Industrie 4.0 Working Group, {eid: 84920960599}>, <The Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <A Survey of Research on Cloud Robotics and Automation, {eid: 84924680020}>, <Scientific Micro-Workflows : Where Event-Driven Approach Meets Workflows to Support Digital Twins, {eid: 85079035724}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Micro-Workflows: Kafka and Kepler Fusion to Support Digital Twins of Industrial Processes, {eid: 85061769858}>, <A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <A Survey on Platoon-Based Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 84962359205}>, <Event Driven Architecture, {eid: 84925655451}>, <Event-Driven Architecture Overview, {eid: 50249137591}>, <Microservices validation: Mjolnirr platform case study, {eid: 84946103342}>, <None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <None, {eid: 84963909685}>, <None, {eid: 84930678109}>, <None, {eid: 84886745724}>, <Cloud migration process-A survey, evaluation framework, and open challenges, {eid: 84978904039}>, <None, {eid: 85061791641}>, <None, {eid: 84871553314}>, <A Distributed Stream Processing based Architecture for IoT Smart Grids Monitoring, {eid: 85058316182}>, <DEBS Grand Challenge : Real time Load Prediction and Outliers Detection using STORM, {eid: 84903165991}>, <None, {eid: 85079041361}>, <None, {eid: 84904332358}>, <Real-Time Anomaly Detection from Environmental Data Streams, {eid: 84945960187}>, <None, {eid: 85066493383}>, <A high throughput processing engine for taxi-generated data streams, {eid: 84960948972}>, <None, {eid: 85079070119}>, <None, {eid: 85079068100}>, <None, {eid: 85079056786}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <A Systematic Mapping Study in Microservice Architecture, {eid: 85011262976}>, <None, {eid: 85079055714}>, <None, {eid: 84923680682}>, <None, {eid: 85057008293}>, <None, {eid: 85079059100}>, <None, {eid: 85079055636}>, <None, {eid: 85079037690}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/21/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079071242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its first introduction in 2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of applications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial intelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.","Cyber-physical system, Digital twin, Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <A software-defined framework for the integrated management of smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 85039453232}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <None, {eid: 85081157087}>, <Integrated tool chain for model-based design of cyber-physical systems: The into-cps project, {eid: 84983000693}>, <Systemj: A gals language for system level design, {eid: 77957879241}>, <Grl: A specification language for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems, {eid: 84908701663}>, <Multiclock esterel, {eid: 84947206586}>, <The esterel synchronous programming language: Design, semantics, implementation, {eid: 0026953373}>, <None, {eid: 0003418449}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <None, {eid: 85081154629}>, <The temporal semantics of concurrent programs, {eid: 49149133038}>, <Automationml\-The glue for seamless automation engineering, {eid: 56349149489}>, <A structural approach to operational semantics, {eid: 2942572885}>, <None, {eid: 4644222521}>, <None, {eid: 0003654667}>, <Iopt-tools-A web based tool framework for embedded systems controller development using petri nets, {eid: 84898668110}>, <Online rotor mixed fault diagnosis way based on spectrum analysis of instantaneous power in squirrel cage induction motors, {eid: 4544373211}>, <Fault identification for robot manipulators, {eid: 27144485807}>, <Sampling-based motion planning with temporal goals, {eid: 77955794699}>, <Monitoring temporal properties of continuous signals, {eid: 27944453169}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/17/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081154595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key enabler for the advances promised by CPPSs is the concept of a digital twin, which is the virtual representation of a real-world entity, or the physical twin. An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations. This architecture provides a service-based and real-time enabled infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration. To evaluate the architecture, it was implemented for a small, but typical, physical manufacturing system component.","Cyber physical systems (CPS), Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Internet of things (IoT), OPC, Tecnomatix",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85006080283}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <None, {eid: 84991364515}>, <Embedded digital twin for ARTI-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Analysis of OPC UA performances, {eid: 84884500285, doi: 10.1016/j.csi.2013.06.004}>, <Performance evaluation of OPC UA, {eid: 78650534914}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <None, {eid: 85087000373}>, <None, {eid: 85059093528}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85059079453}>, <None, {eid: 85086998540}>, <None, {eid: 85059077132}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models, {eid: 84928667408, doi: 10.3390/s150304837}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}>, <None, {eid: 79957551757}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2015.08.004}>, <Review on cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85010065711, doi: 10.1109/JAS.2017.7510349}>, <None, {eid: 85086992184}>, <None, {eid: 85086984554}>, <None, {eid: 85056624416}>, <None, {eid: 85059098452}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.06.005}>, <Cyber physical process monitoring systems, {eid: 84949993153, doi: 10.1007/s10845-015-1180-z}>, <Round-trip delay estimation in OPC UA ServerClient communication channel, {eid: 85009776803, doi: 10.5755/j01.eie.22.6.17229}>, <None, {eid: 85076280430}>, <None, {eid: 85086991713}>, <None, {eid: 85053398467}>, <Literature review of Industry 4.0 and related technologies, {eid: 85078567359}>, <Documentation and records: Harmonized GMP requirements, {eid: 80052228922, doi: 10.4103/0975-1483.80303}>, <None, {eid: 85086985933}>, <Integrating the digital twin of a shop floor conveyor in the manufacturing control system, {eid: 85070650523}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Cybersecurity Considerations for Industrie 4.0, {eid: 85070638283}>, <A six-layer architecture for digital twins with aggregation, {eid: 85070603892, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-27477-1_13}>, <A Centralized Support Infrastructure (CSI) to Manage CPS Digital Twin, towards the Synchronization between CPS Deployed on the Shopfloor and Their Digital Representation, {eid: 85076290432}>, <Multi-agent system architectures for collaborative prognostics, {eid: 85068194472, doi: 10.1007/s10845-019-01478-9}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.040}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <None, {eid: 85086988006}>, <None, {eid: 85097986136}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Digital twins and cyber–physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049, doi: 10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>",,,Springer,,,8/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85076271545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Six-Layer Architecture for Digital Twins with Aggregation (SLADTA) is a framework for a digital twin suitable for complex systems with a large network of devices. An important part of this architecture is using an asynchronous, secure and vendor-neutral communication protocol suitable for a large network of devices. MQTT is here evaluated as a communication protocol for a digital twin data pipeline based of SLADTA. The evaluation includes a case study for a simulated heliostat field, using MQTT through Google Cloud Platform’s (GCP) IoT Core broker and the accompanying Cloud Pub/Sub service. For comparison, the case study also uses MQTT through the Eclipse Mosquitto broker. The case study demonstrates the potential of MQTT in SLADTA for complex systems’ digital twins.","Digital Twin, MQTT, SLADTA",,,,,,,,"<Comparison of digital twin development in manufacturing and maritime domains, {eid: 85070640016}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <None, {eid: 85103441838}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Predictive big data analytics and cyber physical systems for TES systems, {eid: 85048640662}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A six-layer architecture for digital twins with aggregation, {eid: 85070603892}>, <Choice of effective messaging protocols for IoT systems: MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP, {eid: 85040112745}>, <None, {eid: 85103470213}>, <A six-layer architecture for the digital twin: A manufacturing case study implementation, {eid: 85089250665}>, <None, {eid: 85076639395}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85103467740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

To evaluate this claim, this paper selects an architecture of the Digital Twin and realizes it on the basis of an application scenario for a cyber-physical manufacturing system. A case study is used to test the reconfiguration of a manufacturing system by comparing two different methods, one without and one with use of the Digital Twin. In this paper, the process steps of both reconfigurations are described and discussed in detail and a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the reconfiguration results is presented. Finally, this paper gives an outlook on future research on intelligent automation of manufacturing systems using the Digital Twin.","architecture of Digital Twin, assistance systems, Digital Twin, reconfiguration",,,,,,,,"<Consistency check to synchronize the Digital Twin of manufacturing automation based on anchor points, {eid: 85049592057, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.166}>, <A concept in synchronization of virtual production system with real factory based on anchor-point method, {eid: 85044658638, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2017.12.168}>, <An architecture of an Intelligent Digital Twin in a Cyber-Physical Production System, {eid: 85073869890, doi: 10.1515/auto-2019-0039}>, <Synchronisierung von digitalen Modellen, {eid: 85053283464, doi: 10.17560/atp.v59i07-08.1902}>, <None, {eid: 0142208258}>, <None, {eid: 77957342423}>, <None, {eid: 85086378948}>, <None, {eid: 85086400007}>, <None, {eid: 85086377816}>, <None, {eid: 77954350348, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-04674-2}>, <Interoperabilität von Engineering-Werkzeugen: Konzepte und Empfehlungen für den Datenaustausch zwischen Engineering-Werkzeugen, {eid: 80053230418, doi: 10.1524/auto.2011.0938}>, <None, {eid: 85086371808}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <None, {eid: 85073870095, doi: 10.3139/9783446446496.fm}>, <None, {eid: 85086385985}>, <None, {eid: 85055721125, doi: 10.1145/3241403.3241417}>, <Next Generation Digital Twin: An Ecosystem for Mechatronic Systems?, {eid: 85077494977, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.685}>, <None, {eid: 84946685780, doi: 10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005144}>",,,De Gruyter Oldenbourg,,,6/25/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85086369671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.","artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, Digital twin, hybrid analysis and modeling, machine learning",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85028076136}>, <None, {eid: 85081081436}>, <None, {eid: 85081090716}>, <Experimentable digital twins Streamlining simulation-based systems engineering for industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <None, {eid: 85081092982}>, <Actigraphy as an objective intra-individual marker of activity patterns in acute-phase bipolar disorder: A case series, {eid: 85056238980}>, <Computer modelling to personalize bioengineered heart valves, {eid: 85047357324}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control over mobile networks: Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Advances in organon-A-chip engineering, {eid: 85051246777}>, <Organoid-on-A-chip and body-on-A-chip systems for drug screening and disease modeling, {eid: 84981734428}>, <None, {eid: 85081092828}>, <Health care in the cyberspace: Medical cyber-physical system and digital twin challenges, {eid: 85081088828}>, <Challenges and research directions in medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155167716}>, <Medical cyber-physical systems: A survey, {eid: 85043473992}>, <Emerging security mechanisms for medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84976524779}>, <A survey on wireless body area networks, {eid: 79951723271}>, <US economic sensitivity to weather variability, {eid: 79961049711}>, <The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction, {eid: 84940937976}>, <Urban finescale forecasting reveals weather conditions with unprecedented detail, {eid: 85029851316}>, <Using smartphones for monitoring atmospheric tides, {eid: 85046743732}>, <Private observations improve MET Norways operational weather forecasts, {eid: 85081078971}>, <A hybrid ETKF 3DVAR data assimilation scheme for the WRF model.

All rights reserved.There are lots of general parts with frequent maintenance and high interchangeability for continuous casting machine during its operation and maintenance. To acquire the service information of each general part under the environment of high temperature and serious oil pollution for predicting remaining life and preventative maintenance, a digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability system for general parts in continuous casting machine is proposed. First, the systematic architecture of proposed approach is given in detail, where a typical five-layer model for digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability is established. Second, the Web-based 3D visualization monitoring for continuous casting machine is achieved by using lightweight 3D twin model. After that, an assembly model based on polychromatic sets is built for expressing and describing the assembly relationships and assembly process of general parts. Meanwhile, an encoding rule for part and position is put forward by considering assembly position information. On the basis of that, the general parts with total process information are traced in the service life cycle. Finally, digital twin-based 3D visualization monitoring and traceability prototype system is developed and implemented, where the experiment cases verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.","3D twin model, 3D visualization monitoring, Digital twin, Polychromatic sets, Traceability",,,,,,,,"<Towards a Cost-Effective and Reusable Traceability System.

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,12/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099750826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital Twins have been in the focus of research in recent years, trying to achieve the vision of Industry 4.0. In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure. A proof-of-concept shows the application of Semantic Web technologies for instantiating the proposed GDTA for a use case of a Packed-Bed Thermal Energy Storage (PBTES).","Cyber–physical system, Digital Twin, Industrial energy systems, Industry 4.0, Semantic web, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<Reviewing literature on digitalization, business model innovation, and sustainable industry: Past achievements and future promises, {eid: 85059981198}>, <A Complex View of Industry 4.0, {eid: 84977470136}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <None, {eid: 85055039994}>, <Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Reference Framework for Digital Twins within Cyber–Physical Systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <Digital Twins for Industrial Applications.

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Injection molding, Model-driven development, Reference architecture",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Digital behavioral twins for safe connected cars, {eid: 85056832496}>, <Machinability assessment of inconel 718 by factorial design of experiment coupled with response surface methodology, {eid: 0343168164}>, <Practical applications of Taguchi method for optimization of processing parameters for plastic injection moulding: A retrospective review, {eid: 84923316802}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Constance: an intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <Injection molding setup by means of machine learning based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85072959161}>, <Combined learning processes for injection moulding based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85097342280}>, <Flexibilisation of injection moulding manufacture through digitisation, {eid: 85086233825}>, <Approaches of self-optimising systems in manufacturing, {eid: 85149036760}>, <None, {eid: 85086227181}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85054903830}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <None, {eid: 84905811248}>, <Abstraction and refinement in hierarchically decomposable and underspecified CPS-architectures, {eid: 85052702289}>, <Jenseits menschlicher fähigkeiten.

Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert' judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value determining method by accurate expert scoring.","Analytic hierarchy process, Complex networks, Digital twin, Evidence theory, Fuzzy number, Intelligent manufacturing, PROMETHEE II, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Report of the world commission on environment and development, {eid: 58149372152}>, <Perspectives of environmental education and environmental management in Bangladesh and their sustainability, {eid: 85102763751}>, <Coordinates of the accounting in Romania.

Engineering and monitoring interactive digital twins currently demands integrating different piecemeal technologies that effectively hinders their application and deployment. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived. We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing.","Digital Twins, Information systems, Model-driven software engineering, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <Model-based generation of enterprise information systems, {eid: 85048362638}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A multi agent system architecture to implement collaborative learning for social industrial assets, {eid: 85052888258}>, <None, {eid: 85086228557}>, <Systematic language extension mechanisms for the MontiArc architecture description language, {eid: 85025126026}>, <Architectural programming with MontiArcAutomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <A distributed ledger approach to digital twin secure data sharing, {eid: 85069511065}>, <None, {eid: 85065215650}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Continuous transition from model-driven prototype to full-size real-world enterprise information systems, {eid: 85096970269}>, <None, {eid: 85069873204}>, <Automatic synthesis from UML/ MARTE models using channel semantics, {eid: 84874155522}>, <Digital twins as a modern approach to design of industrial processes, {eid: 85064730379}>, <None, {eid: 0003712808}>, <Visualising the digital twin using web services and augmented reality, {eid: 85012932205}>, <A domain model-driven approach for producing user interfaces to multi-platform information systems, {eid: 84876552310}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <None, {eid: 85097405814}>, <None, {eid: 33748331276}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart shop-floor, {eid: 85056967567}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,11/3/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85097375593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once it is deployed, a critical system cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to introduce security straight from the early development phases. However, the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often costly or impossible. To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view in the system’s architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical infrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodology to a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating the system security of the obtained solution.","C-ITS, Cyber security, Digital twin, Threat modeling",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85119832588}>, <The industry use cases for the digital twin idea, Chap. 4, {eid: 85119865810}>, <Cyberfactory1-securing the industry 4.0 with cyber-ranges and digital twins, {eid: 85050025311}>, <A digital twin-based privacy enhancement mechanism for the automotive industry, {eid: 85065981827}>, <Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center, {eid: 85117542440}>, <Towards security-aware virtual environments for digital twins, {eid: 85056740434}>, <Digital twins for cyber-physical systems security: State of the art and outlook, {eid: 85149551859}>, <None, {eid: 85119822859}>, <None, {eid: 85119853169}>, <None, {eid: 85119872997}>, <None, {eid: 85119824432}>, <None, {eid: 85119828506}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85119885703}>, <None, {eid: 85119833834}>, <None, {eid: 85119825364}>, <None, {eid: 85119859181}>, <A meta language for threat modeling and attack simulations, {eid: 85063280304}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Analyzing the effectiveness of attack countermeasures in a SCADA system, {eid: 85019036296}>, <None, {eid: 85119859339}>, <A state-of-the-art survey of Digital Twin: Techniques, engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation perspectives, {eid: 85075384583}>, <None, {eid: 85103470058}>, <None, {eid: 85111413823}>, <None, {eid: 85119851496}>, <None, {eid: 85119868048}>, <Change impact analysis of feature models, {eid: 84866719344}>, <None, {eid: 85119869508}>, <The Open Group: Reference Architectures and Open Group Standards for the Internet of Things-Four Internet of, {eid: 85119858124}>, <United States Department of Transportation.

Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems.","Architecture, Controlled environment agriculture, Digital twin, Optimization, Productivity",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85087340838}>, <None, {eid: 85042563333}>, <Temperature increase reduces global yields of major crops in four independent estimates, {eid: 85028561747}>, <None, {eid: 85073331006}>, <None, {eid: 71649088197}>, <Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity, {eid: 77957341228}>, <Controlled environment food production for urban agriculture, {eid: 85077971423}>, <Review of energy efficiency in controlled environment agriculture, {eid: 85100551408}>, <Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment agriculture: A transition to plant factories and urban agriculture, {eid: 85042150131}>, <None, {eid: 34250189461}>, <Future food-production systems: Vertical farming and controlled-environment agriculture, {eid: 85042492387}>, <None, {eid: 85082256588}>, <Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms, {eid: 85089611838}>, <Lettuce growth and quality optimization in a plant factory, {eid: 84973598861}>, <Plant factories versus greenhouses: Comparison of resource use efficiency, {eid: 85034756098}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

In this paper we present a novel, modular digital twinning framework developed for the investigation of safety within collaborative robotic manufacturing processes. The modular architecture supports scalable representations of user-defined cyber-physical environments, and tools for safety analysis and control. This versatile research tool facilitates the creation of mixed environments of Digital Models, Digital Shadows, and Digital Twins, whilst standardising communication and physical system representation across different hardware platforms. The framework is demonstrated as applied to an industrial case-study focused on the safety assurance of a collaborative robotic manufacturing process. We describe the creation of a digital twin scenario, consisting of individual digital twins of entities in the manufacturing case study, and the application of a synthesised safety controller from our wider work. We show how the framework is able to provide adequate evidence to virtually assess safety claims made against the safety controller using a supporting validation module and testing strategy. The implementation, evidence and safety investigation is presented and discussed, raising exciting possibilities for the use of digital twins in robotic safety assurance.","automated code generation, collaborative robot safety, digital twins, human-robot collaboration, modular framework, probabilistic model checking, risk-informed software synthesis, robotics",,,,,,,,"<A Classification Proposal of Digital Twin Applications in the Safety Domain, {eid: 85100026730, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2021.107137}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability, interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability, and the CDT model’s integration in practice besides decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.","Artificial intelligence, Building lifecycle management, Cognitive, Decision support, Digital twins, IoT, Optimization, Self-learning",,,,,,,,"<A Concept for

The key benefits of next-generation manufacturing systems are less downtimes and the production of small lot sizes down to lot size 1. I4.0 does not introduce a silver bullet technology, but requires a transformation of the system architecture of production systems. In the literature, however, there systematic guidance for designing manufacturing systems that address central I4.0 use cases like plug'n'produce and end-to-end communication is still missing, as are details on the infrastructure needed to enable I4.0 technologies such as Digital Twins. To contribute to filling this gap, this paper presents (i) a Digital Twin architecture blueprint driven by central I4.0 use cases and (ii) a prototypical open-source implementation of the architecture using the concept of the Asset Administration Shell.","Asset Administration Shell, Digital Twin, Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, ""PlugnProduce"", Software Architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?industry forum, {eid: 84903134983}>, <Sustainable industrial value creation: Benefits and challenges of industry 4.0, {eid: 85035783173}>, <None, {eid: 29944439716}>, <None, {eid: 84930743616}>, <Blueprints for architecture drivers and architecture solutions for Industry 4.0 shopfloor applications, {eid: 85107223377}>, <An application framework of digital twin and its case study, {eid: 85049576881}>, <Enabling industry 4.0 service-oriented architecture through digital twins, {eid: 85107211820}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <None, {eid: 85107220030}>, <Software engineering in industrial automation: State-of-The-Art review, {eid: 84883037727}>, <None, {eid: 84952899781}>, <None, {eid: 85107189584}>, <The stuttgart it architecture for manufacturing, {eid: 85071374517}>, <None, {eid: 85034604760}>, <None, {eid: 85107203318}>, <None, {eid: 85107221533}>, <Industry 4.0: Towards future industrial opportunities and challenges, {eid: 84966558951}>, <The role of the Industry 4.0 asset administration shell and the digital twin during the life cycle of a plant, {eid: 85044475829}>, <OpenPnP: A plug-And-produce architecture for the industrial internet of things, {eid: 85072105304}>, <None, {eid: 85107204234}>, <The use of Digital Twin for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, {eid: 85074990841}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85107203650}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in IIoT systems, {eid: 85062630045}>, <None, {eid: 85073869890}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smartworkshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,5/26/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85107191722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS. This study thus contributes toward the advancement of intelligent machine tools from the context of smart manufacturing.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Machine tool, Monitoring, Sensor

However, the dilemma between the scope and scale needs a sophisticated reference architecture, a right set of technologies, and a suitable business model. Most studies in the Digital Twin field have only focused on manufacturing and proposed explicit frameworks and architecture, which faced challenges to support different integration levels through an agile process. Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service and mass individualization.","Augmented reality, Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Industry

How to systematically monitor and evaluate its overall real-time operation status, and to invoke the most appropriate decision-making level, use the most economical computational resource, and conduct a synchronized decision-making and control to the most accurate operation scope to address a randomly occurred dynamics has remained a long-term challenge for researchers. This paper proposes a multi-level cloud computing enabled digital twin system for the real-time monitor, decision and control of a synchronized production logistics system. In the IoT-driven production logistics synchronization (PLS) system with complete real-time information, the dynamics that occurred in the physical layer could be accurately and real-timely captured and its negative effects on the system's overall operation state could be effectively evaluated in the digital layer. For slight, moderate and severe dynamics, edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing and their dynamically formed multi-level distributed decision-making system will be used to deal with the dynamics in the most effective and economical mode. Finally, the PLS optimization model of production and storage is presented with an industrial case, and the effectiveness is also demonstrated and analyzed.","Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Edge computing, Fog computing, Production logistics, Synchronization",,,,,,,,"<Internet-of-things based dynamic synchronization of production and logistics: Mechanism, System and Case Study, {eid: 84949956483}>, <Synchronized Decision-making and Control Method for Opti-state Execution of Dynamic Production Systems with Internet of Things, {eid: 85056344896, doi: 10.3901/JME.2018.16.024}>, <Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics synchronization mechanism and method toward customer order dynamics, {eid: 85018782598, doi: 10.1177/0142331217691218}>, <CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud computing and internet of things-based cloud manufacturing service system, {eid: 84896931467, doi: 10.1109/TII.2014.2306383}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143, doi: 10.1115/MSEC2018-6435}>, <Cavitation phenomena in the injection nozzle: theoretical and numerical analysis, {eid: 80054776618}>, <Flexible machine layout design for dynamic and uncertain production environments, {eid: 0032122942}>, <Towards IoT-enabled dynamic service optimal selection in multiple manufacturing clouds, {eid: 85086824960, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.004}>, <A fault-tolerant control strategy for multiple automated guided vehicles, {eid: 85080141919, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.02.009}>, <New integration of preventive maintenance and production planning with cell formation and group scheduling for dynamic cellular manufacturing systems, {eid: 85087394458, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.011}>, <A multi-objective algorithm for task scheduling and resource allocation in cloud-based disassembly, {eid: 84991271089, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.09.008}>, <Coordinating order acceptance and integrated production-distribution scheduling with batch delivery considering Third Party Logistics distribution, {eid: 85034077664, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.11.001}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152, doi: 10.13196/j.cims.2017.08.001}>, <Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication, 2014, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Isogeometric Fatigue Damage Prediction in Large-Scale Composite Structures Driven by Dynamic Sensor Data, {eid: 84953888837, doi: 10.1115/1.4030795}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958, doi: 10.1115/SMASIS2015-8975}>, <A travel-time model for a person-onboard order picking system, {eid: 69249215373}>, <RFID-based wireless manufacturing for real-time management of job shop WIP inventories, {eid: 51849166450, doi: 10.1007/s00170-006-0897-4}>, <Cloud manufacturing: A computing and service-oriented manufacturing model, {eid: 84862908560, doi: 10.1177/0954405411405575}>, <Digital Twin Data Modeling with AutomationML and a Communication Methodology for Data Exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <Digital-twin-driven geometric optimization of centrifugal impeller with free- form blades for fi ve-axis fl ank milling, {eid: 85087755544, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.019}>, <MES-integrated digital twin frameworks, {eid: 85085180521, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.05.007}>, <Digital Twin as Enabler for an Innovative Digital Shopfloor Management System in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen -

A three-level virtual modeling approach of Element-Behavior-Rule is proposed for the physical environment modeling in a digital environment. An element model, behavior model and rule model are defined, respectively, and the relationship among the three-layer model is given for real-time communication.

These features may pose challenges for the efficient operation and management, while manual tasks may significantly increase human errors or near misses, having impact on the propagation of effects and parallel interactions within these systems. In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, a digital twin (DT) integrated in a multi-agent cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) with the help of RFID technology is proposed. The proposed reference architecture tends to improve the trackability and traceability of complex manufacturing processes. In this research work, the interactions occurring both within a single complex manufacturing system and between multiple sites within a supply chain are considered. For the implementation of the integrated DT-CPMS, a simulation model employing the agent-based modelling technique is developed. A case study from a cryogenic supply chain in the UK is also selected to show the application and validity of the proposed digital solution. The results prove that the DT-CPMS architecture can improve system's performance in terms of human, equipment and space utilisations.","Agent-based modelling, Complex manufacturing, Cyber-Physical System, Digital twin, RFID",,,,,,,,"<C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical System for sustainable project Scheduling, {eid: 85079645451}>, <Defining a digital twin-based Cyber-physical production System for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85086260271}>, <A modular hybrid simulation framework for complex manufacturing system design, {eid: 85061135493}>, <RFID application in a multi-agent cyber physical manufacturing system, {eid: 85106918005}>, <A review on human-centered IoT-connected smart labels for the industry 4.0, {eid: 85046488692}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <Blockchain-based data management for digital twin of product, {eid: 85079151075}>, <Reference framework for digital twins within cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <The multi-agent approach for developing a cyber-physical system for managing precise farms with digital twins of plants, {eid: 85077607130}>, <A Cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <FMU-supported simulation for CPS digital twin, {eid: 85070631431}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical production system architectural framework for personalized production, {eid: 85076628276}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Digital twins and cyber-physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Development of a smart cyber-physical manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context, {eid: 85070961256}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart, {eid: 85120705540}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,6/7/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85120686175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the digital twin technology, a quad-play CMCO (i.e., Configuration design-Motion planning-Control development-Optimization decoupling) design architecture is put forward for the design of the flow-type smart manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context. The iteration logic of the CMCO design model is expounded. Two key enabling technologies for enabling the customized and software-defined design of flow-type smart manufacturing systems are presented, including the generalized encapsulation of the quad-play CMCO model and the digital twin technique. A prototype of a digital twin-based manufacturing system design platform, named Digital Twin System, is presented based on the CMCO model. The digital twin-based design platform is verified with a case study of the hollow glass smart manufacturing system. The result shows that the Digital Twin System-based design approach is feasible and efficient.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Manufacturing system design, Smart

The combination with advanced data analytics and information and communication technologies allows Digital Twins to perform real-time simulation, optimization and prediction to their physical counterparts. Efficient bi-directional data exchange is the foundation for Digital Twin implementation. However, the widely mentioned cloud-based architecture has disadvantages, such as high pressure on bandwidth and long latency time, which limit Digital Twins to provide real-time operating responses in dynamic manufacturing processes. Edge computing has the characteristics of low connectivity, the capability of immediate analysis and access to temporal data for real-time analytics, which makes it a fit-for-purpose technology for Digital Twin development. In this paper, the benefits of edge computing to Digital Twin are first explained through the reviews of the two technologies. The Digital Twin functions to be performed at the edge are then elaborated. After that, how the data model will be used in the edge for data mapping to realize the Digital Twin is illustrated and the data mapping strategy based on the EXPRESS schemas is discussed. Finally, a case study is carried out to verify the data mapping strategy based on EXPRESS schema.

While Industry 4.0 is still a big challenge for many manufacturing companies, reference architectures have been increasingly adopted in different domains to guide engineers on how their systems should interoperate and be structured. Companies have made different experiences with reference architectures for Industry 4.0. However, depending on the use cases addressed, a reference architecture may be more or less suited to support the transformation of a particular company. Besides, a complete understanding of existing representative architectures does not exist. The main goal of this work is to review existing reference architectures for Industry 4.0 and analyze them concerning their suitability for supporting Industry 4.0 processes and solutions. For this, we systematically researched these architectures and thoroughly analyzed and characterized them. We also address their use and technologies/tools that could support their implementation. As a result, we found that existing architectures still have a long way to go; hence, we present the most urgent steps for the near future. We conclude that the Industry 4.0 community is right in investing in reference architectures considering the future of Industry 4.0.","Industry 4.0, Interoperability, Reference architecture, Software

Digital twin provides support to users and processes in decision-making creating high-fidelity virtual models from physical objects in order to simulate their behaviors, predict their states, provide feedbacks, and if possible be optimized by themselves. The literature indicates an urgent need to develop digital twin applications. These applications require a digital platform that complies with DT requirements and allows all physical objects, virtual models, and industrial systems to communicate and integrate with each other. The contribution of this paper is to provide an analysis about digital twin (meaning and modeling), and to present a platform that works as: (1) a modern distributed system that runs as a cluster and can elastically scale to handle and integrate all the business applications, systems, and production data even the most massive data volumes; (2) a storage system that keeps data as long as necessary and provides real guarantees in delivery, persistence, performance (real time), reliability, and processing; (3) a real-time event-based platform that supports the requirements of digital twin applications including the management and support of different digital twin versions.","Digital twin, Event-based architecture, Real-time information, Smart production systems",,,,,,,,"<TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, {eid: 85112631124}>, <An industrial Internet of things based platform for context-aware information services in manufacturing, {eid: 85050917823, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2018.1500716}>, <None, {eid: 85112593671}>, <Apache Kafka.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital Twins (DT) in industrial cyber-physical systems are the key enabling technology for Industry 4.0. Services are an essential part of almost every DT concept, but their interaction is usually implementation-specific since no common guidelines are available. This work identifies some fundamental requirements for a DT service framework based on applications identified in corresponding literature. Based on these requirements, a service framework architecture is proposed. The architecture utilizes Semantic Web technology and a workflow engine for service orchestration to support the fulfilment of the identified requirements. As a case study for sensor data evaluation of an industrial process, a proof-of-concept implementation is presented, showing the feasibility and suitability of the proposed DT service framework architecture.","Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Knowlege graph, Microservice, Semantic Web, Service architecture, Workflow engine",,,,,,,,"<Reviewing literature on digitalization, business model

Through digital twin technology, it is virtually possible to virtualize a product, process or service and the information interaction and co-evolution between physical and information world. Machine Learning (ML) can improve the cognitive, reasoning and decision-making abilities of the digital twin through knowledge extraction. The full life cycle management of complex equipment is considered the key to the intelligent transformation and upgrading of the modern manufacturing industry. The application of the above two technologies in the full life cycle management of complex equipment is going to make each stage of the life cycle more responsive, predictable and adaptable. In this study, we have proposed a full life cycle digital twin architecture for complex equipment. We have described four specific scenarios in which two typical machine learning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning are applied which are further used to enhance digital twin in various stages of complex equipment. At the end of this study, we have summarized the application advantages of the combination of digital twin and machine learning while addressing future research direction in this domain.","complex equipment, deep reinforcement learning, digital twin, full life cycle management",,,,,,,,"<Artificial-intelligence-driven customized manufacturing factory: Key technologies, applications, and challenges, {eid: 85111016360}>, <A smart manufacturing service system based on edge computing, fog computing, and cloud computing, {eid: 85069774249}>, <A reconfigurable method for intelligent manufacturing based on industrial cloud and edge intelligence, {eid: 85084926323}>, <Intelligent manufacturing-main direction of""made in china 2025, {eid: 84943223104}>, <Improving cognitive ability of edge intelligent iiot through machine learning, {eid: 85073325061}>, <Connotation, architecture and trends of product digital twin, {eid: 85021844855}>, <Current development of heavyduty manufacturing equipments, {eid: 78449251522}>, <Five-dimension digital twin model and its ten applications, {eid: 85064443425}>, <Digital twins technolgy and its data fusion in iron and steel product life cycle, {eid: 85048233664}>, <An explorative study on management and maintenance of systems for design and manufacture of customized products, {eid: 85009865408}>, <Research on intelligent evaluation method for machining state oriented to process quality control, {eid: 85058023819}>, <Machine learning with big data: Challenges and approaches, {eid: 85028802280}>, <Research on intelligent method of manufacturing and processing equipment based on digital twin, {eid: 85087843960}>, <Automatic generative design to meet customers preferences, {eid: 84946530894}>, <Time series data for equipment reliability analysis with deep learning, {eid: 85087481039}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85111038740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.","artificial intelligence, big data, Digital twin, industry 40, machine

Web-based digital twin (WDT) has great potential for promoting sustainability in industrial cyber-physical systems. The current work demonstrates the mechanism by which a WDT architecture is established and utilised for improving sustainability. This is achieved by: a) accessing the control parameters that influence energy consumption, b) logging the energy consumption data and c) producing predictions by means of a computational algorithm. The objective is to support the system developer in delivering verified machine functionality along with trusted productivity and sustainability. The implementation is exemplified by an industrial case study adopted from a battery assembly production line.","Online technologies, Sustainability, Sustainable manufacturing, Web-based digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Virtual engineering in the support of sustainable assembly systems, {eid: 85100852318}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85112384663}>, <A prototype web-based user interface for sustainability modeling and optimization, {eid: 85112367657}>, <Sustainable manufacturing indicator repository, {eid: 84863583988}>, <Factory optima: A web-based system for composition and analysis of manufacturing service networks based on a reusable model repository, {eid: 85061330013}>, <Energy-efficient cyber-physical production network: Architecture and technologies, {eid: 85060116834}>, <Embedded digital twin for arti-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <Resource virtualization: A core technology for developing cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85046643014}>, <Towards industry 4. 0 with iot: Optimizing business processes in an evolving manufacturing factory, {eid: 85072729743}>, <Exploiting the digital twin in the assessment and optimization of sustainability performances, {eid: 85065990183}>, <Digital twin-based sustainable intelligent manufacturing: A review, {eid: 85072166366}>, <A digital twin for grinding wheel: An information sharing platform for sustainable grinding process, {eid: 85059482106}>, <Energy-aware resources in digital twin: The case of injection moulding machines, {eid: 85070656949}>, <Service-oriented platform for smart operation of dyeing and finishing industry, {eid: 85060933276}>, <Digital twin for energy optimization in an SMT-PCB assembly line, {eid: 85061704099}>, <Event-driven online machine state decision for energy-efficient manufacturing system based on digital twin using max-plus algebra, {eid: 85072638218}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Maintenance and digital health control in smart manufacturing based on condition monitoring, {eid: 85100866106}>, <None, {eid: 84984837118}>, <None, {eid: 0003754441}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85112350537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This article contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter, referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason, to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities as well as benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields.","Cyber-physical systems, digital twins (DTs), robotics",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85101762292}>, <None, {eid: 85101768198}>, <Digital twins of human robot collaboration in a production setting, {eid: 85060466179}>, <Integrated architecture for industrial robot programming and control, {eid: 0033309389}>, <Parallel simulation of virtual testbed applications, {eid: 85101763686}>, <Industry 4.0-digital twins and opc ua, {eid: 85101773235}>, <Digital twin driven human-robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252}>, <Digital twin and virtual reality: A co-simulation environment for design and assessment of industrial workstations, {eid: 85071966393}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control overmobile networks:Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Integrating virtual reality and digital twin in circular economy practices: A laboratory application case, {eid: 85082818983}>, <Digital manufacturing tools in the simulation of collaborative robots: Towards industry 4.0, {eid: 85085079406}>, <Human robot interaction for future remote manipulations in industry 4.0, {eid: 85101740360}>, <Motion planning by integration of multiple policies for complex assembly tasks, {eid: 85101767758}>, <Design and constant force control of a parallel polishing machine, {eid: 84910683748}>, <Force control of cable-driven parallel robots, {eid: 84988532625}>, <On the role of robot configuration in cartesian stiffness control, {eid: 84938271186}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Methoden der mehrkörperdynamiksimulation als grundlage realitätsnaher virtueller welten, {eid: 84892853013}>, <Velocity-based shock propagation for multibody dynamics animation, {eid: 34547260224}>, <Robot collisions: A survey on detection, isolation, and identification, {eid: 85031806485}>, <A new coriolis matrix factorization, {eid: 84864438757}>, <Six-DOF impedance control based on angle/axis representations, {eid: 0032688337}>, <Stiffness identification for serial robot manipulator based on uncertainty approach, {eid: 84855411342}>, <None, {eid: 85101735661}>, <Extracting feasible robot parameters from dynamic coefficients using nonlinear optimizationmethods, {eid: 84977525156}>, <None, {eid: 84891583980}>, <Parallel particle swarm optimization on graphical processing unit for pose estimation, {eid: 84866986397}>, <An overview of null space projections for redundant, torque-controlled robots, {eid: 84942112766}>, <Mass and friction optimization for natural motion in hands-on robotic surgery, {eid: 84954535021}>, <Parameter selection and adaptation in unified particle swarm optimization, {eid: 34247548801}>, <Reaction null space of amultibody system with applications in robotics, {eid: 84897808915}>, <Optimal motion planning of a space robot with base disturbance minimization, {eid: 84897767365}>, <The fast research interface for the kuka lightweight robot, {eid: 78649663145}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,5/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85101785830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is known to be a complex system because of its severe constraints as it controls critical applications. It is difficult to manage such networks and keep control of all the variables impacting their operation during their whole lifecycle. Meanwhile, Digital Twinning technology has been increasingly used to optimize the performances of industrial systems and has been ranked as one of the top ten most promising technological trends in the next decade. Many Digital Twins of industrial systems exist nowadays but only few are destined to networks. In this paper, we propose a holistic digital twinning architecture for the IIoT where the network is integrated along with the other industrial components of the system. To do so, the concept of Network Digital Twin is introduced. The main motivation is to permit a closed-loop network management across the whole network lifecycle, from the design to the service phase. Our architecture leverages the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm as an expression of network softwarization. Mainly, the SDN controller allows for setting up the connection between each Digital Twin of the industrial system and its physical counterpart. We validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture in the process of choosing the most suitable communication mechanism that satisfies the real-time requirements of a Flexible Production System.","Digital Twining, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, Software Defined Networks",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85057495661}>, <Smart factory performance and Industry 4.0, {eid: 85074301976}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry, {eid: 85065156908}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <Digital Twin and Big Data Towards Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: 360 Degree Comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Numerical investigation of the interaction, transport and deposition of multicom-ponent droplets in a simple mouth-throat model, {eid: 85007417139}>, <Systems engineering and digital twin: A vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations, {eid: 85074479906}>, <None, {eid: 85120774828}>, <None, {eid: 85120826366}>, <Disaster City Digital Twin: A vision for integrating artificial and human intelligence for disaster management, {eid: 85077166289}>, <Reengineering aircraft structural life prediction using a digital twin, {eid: 84855216556}>, <A Maturity Model for Digital Twin Implementations in the Commercial Aerospace OEM Industry, {eid: 85113740805}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Smart factory use case model based on digital twin, {eid: 85052236749}>, <Intelligent digital twin-based software-defined vehicular networks, {eid: 85087066942}>, <Digital Twin Network: Concepts and Reference Architecture, {eid: 85122777422}>, <Digital twin for 5G and beyond, {eid: 85102889168}>, <Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey, {eid: 84919935425}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling Innovation in Campus Networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <Improving network management with software defined networking, {eid: 84873897891}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The Development of Digital Twin Technology Review, {eid: 85100925523}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Digital twin: Manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Robust Additive Manufacturing Performance through a Control Oriented Digital Twin, {eid: 85104769822}>, <DT-II:Digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet reference framework towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85073509951}>, <Application-Driven Network-Aware Digital Twin Management in Industrial Edge Environments, {eid: 85103239228}>, <None, {eid: 85105575085}>, <None, {eid: 70349510694}>, <Murphy loves potatoes: Experiences from a pilot sensor network deployment in precision agriculture, {eid: 33847162489}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <None, {eid: 77955557900}>, <None, {eid: 85030326793}>, <SDN-WISE: Design, prototyping and experimentation of a stateful SDN solution for WIreless SEnsor networks, {eid: 84954204152}>, <SD-WISE: A Software-Defined WIreless SEnsor network, {eid: 85065823154}>, <From IEEE 802.15.4 to IEEE 802.15.4e: A Step Towards the Internet of Things, {eid: 84903692507}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e: A survey, {eid: 84973662796}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e in a Nutshell: Survey and Performance Evaluation, {eid: 85041409643}>, <Traffic Aware Scheduling Algorithm for Reliable Low-Power Multi-Hop IEEE 802.15.4e Networks, {eid: 84871986780}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2021,,,,,,34960288.0,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85120812912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.","architecture,

However, in the vast majority of the cases, the architectures and technologies presented are strongly bounded to the domain where the DTs are applied. This article proposes the FIWARE Ecosystem, combining its catalog of components and smart data models as a solution for the development of any DT.

The high participation of each stakeholder in this type of product production places a higher requirement on sufficient collaboration among social, cyber and physical spaces. However, under a decentralised social manufacturing network, the management of SMRs has encountered some real-life challenges in terms of their distributed and heterogeneous features. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform (BcDTCP) as an integrated solution to address these challenges. A hybrid domain-driven design method is presented to design and implement business-knowledge driven systems. To address the heterogeneity of SMRs, a ubiquitous object structure is designed to flexibly adjust the functionality of the digital twin. Blockchain is introduced to construct a peer-to-peer network to organise the SMRs in a decentralised manner. Additionally, a timed coloured Petri net-based workflow is adopted to formulise the collaboration logic into a smart contract executed on the blockchain. Finally, a demonstrative case study is conducted to verify and evaluate the proposed BcDTCP under a 3D printing scenario.","Blockchain, digital twin, domain driven design, resource collaboration,
