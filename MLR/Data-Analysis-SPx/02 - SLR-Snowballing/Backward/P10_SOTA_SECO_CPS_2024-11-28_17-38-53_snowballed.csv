Dang and I. Trotskii, published by De Gruyter 2019.Ever growing building energy consumption requires advanced automation and monitoring solutions in order to improve building energy efficiency. Furthermore, aggregation of building automation data, similarly to industrial scenarios allows for condition monitoring and fault diagnostics of the Heating, Ventilations and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. For existing buildings, the commissioned SCADA solutions provide historical trends, alarms management and setpoint curve adjustments, which are essential features for facility management personnel. The development in Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, as well as software microservices enables higher system integration, data analytics and rich visualization to be integrated into the existing infrastructure. This paper presents the implementation of a technology stack, which can be used as a framework for improving existing and new building automation systems by increasing interconnection and integrating data analytics solutions. The implementation solution is realized and evaluated for a nearly zero energy building, as a case study.","analytics, anomaly detection, Building automation, IoT",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85076283070}>, <State of the art in industrial automation, {eid: 84930695372}>, <None, {eid: 85076290470}>, <None, {eid: 85076314379}>, <None, {eid: 85076315185}>, <Making the move to microservice architecture, {eid: 85050539623}>, <None, {eid: 85076275693}>, <Two-step principal component analysis for dynamic processes monitoring, {eid: 85019408705}>, <Qstatistic and t2-statistic PCA-based measures for damage assessment in structures, {eid: 80052075757}>, <Cloud container technologies: A state-of-The-Art review, {eid: 85050374433}>, <K-shape: Eflcient and accurate clustering of time series, {eid: 85112863727}>, <None, {eid: 85076301200}>, <Machine learning for estimation of building energy consumption and performance: A review, {eid: 85054186947}>, <None, {eid: 85076293878}>, <K-shape clustering algorithm for building energy usage patterns analysis and forecasting model accuracy improvement, {eid: 85018567646}>, <A review on basic data- driven approaches for industrial process monitoring, {eid: 84899481774}>",,,De Gruyter,,,1/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85076318178

Published by Elsevier B.V.More and more elements in a modern production system are becoming smart devices and it is reasonable to integrate them into a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) in a consistent manner. There is the broad goal of many industrial players to open the rich potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which has to be fast, secure and adaptive. The growing number of ""things"" in a production system requires satisfying connectivity solutions that are different to an easy coming ""Peer-to-Peer architecture (P2P)"". The approach followed at the smartfactory@tugraz - the Learning Factory of Graz University of Technology in Austria - to achieve such an integration is to deploy an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), which is at the core of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The goal is to integrate three main software applications including the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the Management Execution System (MES). The additional challenge in this project is that these mentioned main applications are all provided by different suppliers. The selected SOA approach provides the basis for a scalable and extensible solution via Connectivity Modules and standardized interfaces. The smartfactory@tugraz validates this SOA approach by applying it to a real and fully operational manufacturing line. The smartfactory@tugraz is not only a learning factory but rather an open ecosystem by offering both students and researchers as well as industrial partners the ability to perform research on this subject. It is thus the ideal place to study the challenges and to understand the benefits of pushing a CPPS to a mature level in terms of connectivity in a manufacturing context.","Connectivity, CPPS, ESB, OPC UA, Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P), Reference architecture, Service oriented architecture, Smart Factory, SOA Enterprise Service Bus",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise Architectures for the Digital Transformation in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, {eid: 85044637997}>, <Forschungsraum smartfactory@tugraz - Die Sichtbarmachung einer agilen Fertigung, {eid: 85065645479}>, <A critical review of smart manufacturing & Industry 4.0, {eid: 85055904167}>, <None, {eid: 85042671846}>, <None, {eid: 85065647748}>, <SOA and Web Services Interface Design, {eid: 85014273181}>, <Architecting Scalable Enterprise Web Applications, {eid: 85065660830}>, <None, {eid: 33744509965}>, <None, {eid: 85065665480}>, <Enterprise Service Bus, {eid: 85065635720}>, <Loose Coupling, {eid: 85065642717}>, <Whats in a Service?, {eid: 36749076301}>, <None, {eid: 85047244766}>, <None, {eid: 85065658338}>, <None, {eid: 85048818555}>, <Anwendungsbeispiele zur Integration heterogener Steuerungssysteme bei robotergest├╝tzten Industrieanlagen, {eid: 85068473205}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,3/26/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85065662522

Manufacturing systems and more specifically assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development, evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.","Assembly systems, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, IoT, Manufacturing system architecture, Microservices",,,,,,,,"<Analysis of the Methods Time Measurement (MTM) Methodology through its Application in Manufacturing Companies, {eid: 85063105349}>, <Decentralized control: Status and outlook, {eid: 84900474912}>, <Decision support for sequence generation in an assembly-oriented design environment, {eid: 2642553127}>, <Future trends in management and operation of assembly systems: From customized assembly systems to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85041918454}>, <Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing, {eid: 84900826011}>, <Assembly system design in the Industry 4.0 era: A general framework, {eid: 85031791393}>, <Multi-objective assembly line balancing considering component picking and ergonomic risk, {eid: 85028698266}>, <None, {eid: 85067527558}>, <IoT-based configurable information service platform for product lifecycle management, {eid: 84900809305}>, <Modelling and simulation of opportunistic IoT services with aggregate computing, {eid: 85053778744}>, <An advanced cyber physical framework for micro devices assembly, {eid: 85028458837}>, <Assembly system configuration through Industry 4.0 principles: The expected change in the actual paradigms, {eid: 85044859693}>, <A software platform for supporting the design and reconfiguration of versatile assembly systems, {eid: 85049560558}>, <A real-time service-oriented architecture for industrial automation, {eid: 69249218873}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Keeping track of the physical in assembly processes, {eid: 84992560957}>, <Toward opportunistic services for the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85044750246}>, <Assembly system design and operations for product variety, {eid: 80051668632}>, <Constraint-based interactive assembly planning, {eid: 0030675394}>, <Practical semantics for the Internet of Things: Physical states, device mashups, and open questions, {eid: 84962216157}>, <Product, process and system ontologies and knowledge base for managing knowledge between different clients, {eid: 70349108400}>, <Intelligent assembly system for mechanical products and key technology based on internet of things, {eid: 84908081564}>, <An ontology for the definition and validation of assembly processes for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 33746589988}>, <An integrated framework for design, management and operation of reconfigurable assembly systems, {eid: 85029542665}>, <None, {eid: 85063092036}>, <Configuration of smart environments made simple: Combining visual modeling with semantic metadata and reasoning, {eid: 84946175320}>, <Going solo: Hierarchical task analysis of the second driver in two-up (multi-person) freight rail operations, {eid: 85043606627}>, <Capability-based task allocation in human-robot collaboration, {eid: 85020859281}>, <Cyber-physical systems alter automation architectures, {eid: 84900498200}>, <AND/OR Graph representation of assembly plans, {eid: 0025418409}>, <None, {eid: 85063075495}>, <Hierarchical task analysis: Developments, applications, and extensions, {eid: 27744434006}>, <Secure integration of IoT and cloud computing, {eid: 85008227599}>, <A novel ontology-based service model for cyber physical system, {eid: 85039910158}>, <Extended liaison as an interface between product and process model in assembly, {eid: 84899671341}>, <Human-robot collaboration in cellular manufacturing: Design and development, {eid: 76249122509}>, <A Cyber-Physical system-based approach for industrial automation systems, {eid: 84931572168}>, <An open distributed architecture for flexible hybrid assembly systems: a model driven engineering approach, {eid: 84946771754}>, <A framework for MDE of IoT-based manufacturing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85063081388}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: An iot-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602}>, <Towards an IoT-based framework for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 85106545857}>, <Microservices, {eid: 84922850962}>, <Functional composition of sensor web APIs, {eid: 84892394014}>, <Efficient runtime service discovery and consumption with hyperlinked RESTdesc, {eid: 83755186092}>, <IoT and cloud computing in automation of assembly modelling systems, {eid: 84900815294}>, <Industry 4.0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <AutoAssem: An automated assembly planning system for complex products, {eid: 84864564598}>, <Object-oriented templates for automated assembly planning of complex products, {eid: 84898778091}>, <The internet of things for smart Manufacturing: a Review, IISE transactions, {eid: 85063081450}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,1/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85063085792

DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry.

In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.","Data management framework, Factory floor, Industrial internet of things (IIoT), IoT middleware, Smart factory",,,,,,,,"<Challenges and research issues of data management in IoT for large-scale petrochemical plants, {eid: 85019839931}>, <Future IIOT in process automation-Latest trends of standardization in industrial automation, {eid: 84960194698}>, <An Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment, {eid: 84892717180}>, <An industrial big data pipeline for data-driven analytics maintenance applications in large-scale smart manufacturing facilities, {eid: 85013959166}>, <Failure detection and prevention for cyber-physical systems using ontology-based knowledge base, {eid: 85059283597}>, <Health assessment and life prediction of cutting tools based on support vector regression, {eid: 84925292228}>, <The evolution and future of manufacturing: A review, {eid: 84963772214}>, <Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systemsŌĆöReviews, methodology and applications, {eid: 84887056149}>, <None, {eid: 55549116194}>, <None, {eid: 85070538697}>, <Restthing: A restful web service infrastructure for mash-up physical and web resources, {eid: 84862942051}>, <Data management for the Internet of Things: Design primitives and solution, {eid: 84887746858}>, <Middleware for internet of things: A survey, {eid: 84959420432}>, <Distributed data service for data management in internet of things middleware, {eid: 85018349860}>, <Part data integration in the Shop Floor Digital Twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201}>, <Smart factories in Industry 4.0: A review of the concept and of energy management approached in production based on the Internet of Things paradigm, {eid: 84988221092}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395}>, <None, {eid: 85070559440}>, <None, {eid: 84957605573}>, <None, {eid: 85070559277}>, <PwC 20 years inside the mind of the CEO . . .

Not only does the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency secure sustainability through increased energy efficiency but it also improves the efficiency in terms of overall productivity. Dyeing and finishing industries consume massive amounts of energy and have large energy-related expenditures. The industry comprises small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have insufficient capital to pay for the energy-efficient equipment. This study proposes a service-oriented platform that can achieve process and systematic efficiency enhancement based on the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The platform reflects the requirements of dyeing and finishing shops in the industry and secures effective interoperability and services using a service-oriented architectural design. A smart operation enabled by the service-oriented platform to improve the efficiency of traditional processes is developed. The system architecture, P4R data model, and service composition are discussed to understand the proposed process. Results suggest that it is possible to provide dyeing and finishing shops with services for reducing energy costs and improving productivity. The proposed platform also provides high-level services that utilize analytical techniques and data from the IIoT, and it serves as a suitable solution for small- and medium-sized enterprises by reducing costs.","Digital twin, dyeing and finishing shop, energy efficiency, industrial Internet of Things, service-oriented architecture, sustainable manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<C2ps: A Digital Twin

Simulations are frequently used to increase this type of efficiency through diagnosis and evaluation of a physical asset. In particular, digital twin (DT) is currently attracting considerable attention as it provides technical functionality at the type and instance stages of a work center. In addition, DT can support efficient control and decision making with less gap in the site through vertical integration and horizontal coordination. Moreover, DT can contribute to prevent energy-related inefficiency by providing the functionalities required for the service composition of the technical functionalities that are defined for the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency. However, in terms of the provision of service-composition-based technical functionality of DT, no research has defined each step of the operation procedures of work-center-level DT application at a detailed level. This study proposes detailed operation procedures to create, synchronize, and utilize a work-center-level DT to provide appropriate service-composition-based technical functionality. To this end, the technical requirements were derived from the analysis of the service-composition-based technical functionality. This study systematically defined the various service-composition-based technical functionalities through a combination of various types of operation procedures. Each type is defined for three steps, namely creation, synchronization, and utilization. In addition, a case study was conducted to clarify DT and provide a suitable definition for the requirements.","Asset administration shell, Digital twin, Process and systematic efficiency enhancement,

The cooperation and coordination of smart things are a promising strategy for satisfying requirements that are beyond the capacity of a single smart thing. One of the major challenges for today's software engineering is the management of large and complex computing systems characterized by a high degree of physical distribution. Examples of such systems arise in many application domains. The number of connected devices grows from billions to hundreds of billions, so a maximum of automatisms must be integrated in IoT architectures in order to control and manage them. Software architects migrate to service oriented architecture and applications are now being constructed as service compositions. Since each IoT device includes one or more microservices, the increasing number of devices around the user makes them difficult to assemble in order to achieve a common goal. In this paper, we propose a self-assembling solution based on self-controlled service components taking into account non-functional requirements concerning the offered quality of services and the structuration of the resulting assembly. Its aim is to build and maintain an assembly of services (taking into account arrival of new peers or failure of existing ones) that, besides functional requirements, also fulfills global quality-of-service and structural requirements.","Internet of Things, Quality of service, Self-assembly, Service component, Service composition, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<User-assisted semantic interoperability in Internet of Things: visuallyfacilitated ontology alignment through visually-enriched ontology and thing descriptions, {eid: 84881423990}>, <IBM cloud, {eid: 85084938014}>, <Amazon web services, {eid: 85081548120}>, <Microsoft azure, {eid: 85081561000}>, <Adaptive video transmission control system based on reinforcement learning approach over heterogeneous networks, {eid: 85027958784, doi: 10.1109/TASE.2014.2387212}>, <Energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation for delay-constrained video over heterogeneous wireless networks, {eid: 85009971384, doi: 10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632599}>, <Constructing distributed time-critical applications using cognitive enabled services, {eid: 85065664842, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.010}>, <SWITCH workbench: A novel approach for the development and deployment of time-critical microservice-based cloud-native applications, {eid: 85064939462, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.008}>, <An overview of cloud middleware services for interconnection of healthcare platforms, {eid: 84907342232, doi: 10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866753}>, <None, {eid: 85084940100}>, <Autonomic Computing: Principles, Design and Implementation, {eid: 84890106421}>, <Internet of smart things -

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have affected several research fields, leading to improvements that could not have been possible with conventional optimization techniques. Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based humanŌĆōmachine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.","Anomaly detection, Fault detection, Human-Machine interaction, Industry 4.0, Machine learning, Predictive

Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Indiana University of Pennsylvania>, <Department of Information Systems, Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>, <Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>",,"® 2020 Elsevier LtdService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.","Information systems, Service-Oriented Architecture, SOA, Success factors, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<An exploratory study for investigating the issues and current practices of service-oriented architecture adoption, {eid: 85068423836, doi: 10.32890/jict2019.18.3.3}>, <A research on SOA in the IT industry of Pakistan, {eid: 85066803017, doi: 10.1145/3323933.3324080}>, <State of the practice in service identification for SOA migration in industry, {eid: 85056896158, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_46}>, <Energy-aware services composition for Internet of Things, {eid: 85050466884, doi: 10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355213}>, <Event-driven SOA-based iot architecture, {eid: 85040241178, doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-5520-1_24}>, <SOAP-based web service for localization of multi-robot system in cloud, {eid: 85057109748, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-01177-2_29}>, <Cloud computing as a facilitator for web service composition in factory automation, {eid: 84994218554, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1277-z}>, <A case-based reasoning approach to reuse quality-driven designs in service-oriented architectures, {eid: 85049518388, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2018.06.003}>, <Service-oriented architecture: myths, realities, and a maturity model, {eid: 79951897344}>, <Critical factors in the effective of service-oriented architecture, {eid: 84902963791}>, <A proposition of critical success factors influencing SOA implementation in healthcare, {eid: 84905748849}>, <Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and Technology, {eid: 34548309673}>, <Web services architecture w3c working group note 11, {eid: 0142074003}>, <Service-oriented architecture scenario, {eid: 33646928571, doi: 10.2111/REM-D-09-00117.1}>, <Defining SOA as an architectural style: Align your business model with technology, {eid: 41949090570}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture Compass: Business Value, Planning, and Enterprise Roadmap, {eid: 29744464022}>, <Enterprise SOA: Service-oriented architecture best practices, {eid: 33744509965}>, <Service-oriented architecture unlocking hidden value in insurance systems, {eid: 85078544363}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, {eid: 4644300495}>, <SOA: Principles of Service Design, Vol. 1, {eid: 35549003927}>, <Enterprise Service Oriented Architectures: Concepts, Challenges, Recommendations, {eid: 38549091817}>, <Reference model for service oriented architecture 1.0.

Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.","Attack Patterns, CVSS, Cybersecurity pillars, IIoT, Industrial Internet of Things, Industrial Security, Information Technologies, Operational Technologies, Risk

In this tutorial, we explain the fundamental elements of blockchains. We discuss their ability to achieve availability, consistency, and data integrity as well as their inherent limitations. Using Ethereum as a case study, we describe the inner workings of blockchains in detail before comparing blockchains to traditional distributed systems. In the second part of our tutorial, we discuss the major challenges facing blockchains and summarize ongoing research and commercial offerings that seek to address these challenges.","Blockchain,
