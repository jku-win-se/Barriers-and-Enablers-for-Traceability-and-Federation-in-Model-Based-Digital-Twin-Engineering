DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.","Data fusion, digital twin (DT), industry application, modeling",,,,,,,,"<Smart manufacturing must

All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

On the one hand, approaches like Model-Based Systems Engineering or virtual verification and validation demonstrate that digitalization has the effect of demanding computer-interpretable and continuous sets of information. On the other hand, the approaches themselves require new functionalities regarding the engineering IT and thus raise new requirements. This paper presents a systematic approach to identify and analyze the requirements towards an engineering IT architecture.

We aim at identifying industrial and academic tools for cross-domain model management and describing the inconsistency types addressed by them as well as strategies the users of the tools employ to keep consistency between models of different domains. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review. Using the keyword-based search on Google Scholar we analyzed 515 potentially relevant studies; after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 88 papers were selected for further analysis. Results: The main findings/contributions are: (i) a list of available tools used to support model management; (ii) approximately 31% of the tools can provide consistency model checking on models of different domains and approximately 24% on the same domain; (iii) available strategies to keep the consistency between models of different domains are not mature enough; (iv) explicit modeling dependencies between models is not common in the industry. However, it is considered as a requirement by academia if one wishes to manage inconsistency between models of different domains. Conclusion: This study presents an overview of industrial practices and academic approaches about the cross-domain model management. The results presented in this study can be used as a starting point for future research on model management topics, and also for further improvement of actual model management tools.","Model

In this context, one of the most mature and popular standards for distributed simulation is the IEEE 1516-2010 - Standard for M&S high level architecture (HLA). However, building and maintaining distributed simulations components, based on the IEEE 1516-2010 standard, is still a challenging and effort-consuming task. To ease the development of full-fledged HLA-based simulations, the paper proposes the MONADS method (MOdel-driveN Architecture for Distributed Simulation), which relies on the model-driven systems engineering paradigm. The method takes as input system models specified in Systems Modeling Language, the reference modeling language in the systems engineering field, and produces as output the final code of the corresponding HLA-based distributed simulation through a chain of model-to-model and model-to-text transformations. The obtained simulation code is based on the HLA Development Kit software framework, which has been developed by the SMASH-Lab (System Modeling and Simulation Hub - Laboratory) of the University of Calabria (Italy), in cooperation with the Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division (ER) of NASA’s Lyndon B.

In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today’s simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems.","capabilities, Digital twins, MBSE, model-based systems engineering, modelling, variability modelling, Virtual Testbeds",,,,,,,,"<Towards a Capability-Based Framework for Reconfiguring Industrial Production Systems, {eid: 84953897897, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.395}>, <A New eRobotics Approach to Simulation-Based Analysis and Optimization, {eid: 84946687863}>, <None, {eid: 85018936265}>, <A Navigation Framework for Digital Twins of Factories Based on Building Information Modeling, {eid: 85044445847}>, <None, {eid: 84555215963}>, <None, {eid: 85013920640}>, <None, {eid: 0003880013}>, <Modelling Capabilities for Functional Configuration of Part Feeding Equipment, {eid: 85029869010, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.357}>, <Simulation-Based Optimization of Camera Placement in the Context of Industrial Pose Estimation, {eid: 85047784412}>, <Integrating Compositional and Annotative Approaches for Product Line Engineering, {eid: 70349542003}>, <A Variability-Aware Module System, {eid: 84869778723}>, <Finite Element Analysis as a Key Functionality for eRobotics to Predict the Interdependencies between Robot Control and Structural Deformation, {eid: 85064719598}>, <Capability-Based Planning and Scheduling for Adaptable Manufacturing Systems, {eid: 84946691684}>, <A Framework for Modelling Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems Using Hybridized Discrete-Event and Agent-Based Simulation, {eid: 84953874139, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.297}>, <Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems: Principles, Design, and Future Trends, {eid: 85033406486, doi: 10.1007/s11465-018-0483-0}>, <Software Product Line Engineering and Variability Management: Achievements and Challenges, {eid: 84924174468}>, <A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-based Production Systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Aspect-Oriented Modeling for Variability Management, {eid: 55049084345}>, <None, {eid: 84892351987}>, <Interactive Calibration and Visual Programming of Reconfigurable Robotic Workcells, {eid: 85053873933}>, <None, {eid: 0003547470}>, <Delta-Oriented Programming of Software Product Lines, {eid: 78049372449}>, <Experimentable Digital Twins - Streamlining Simulation-Based Systems Engineering for Industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <Virtual Testbeds for the Development of Sensor-Enabled Applications, {eid: 85061513737}>, <Towards Interdisciplinary Variability Modeling for Automated Production Systems: Opportunities and Challenges When Applying Delta Modeling: A Case Study, {eid: 84949503154}>, <CESA 3 R: Highly Versatile Plug-And-Produce Assembly System, {eid: 85001022087}>, <Future Modeling and Simulation of CPS-based Factories: An Example from the Automotive Industry, {eid: 85012920563, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.168}>",,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,5/4/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85064719396

All rights reserved.Large-scale cyber-physical systems such as manufacturing lines generate vast amounts of data to guarantee precise control of their machinery. Visions such as the Industrial Internet of Things aim at making this data available also to computation systems outside the lines to increase productivity and product quality. However, rising amounts and complexities of data and control decisions push existing infrastructure for data transmission, storage, and processing to its limits. In this paper, we exemplarily study a fine blanking line which can produce up to 6.2 Gbit/s worth of data to showcase the extreme requirements found in modern manufacturing. We consequently propose integrated data processing which keeps inherently local and small-scale tasks close to the processes while at the same time centralizing tasks relying on more complex decision procedures and remote data sources.

The IDS represents a multi-sided platform (MSP) for secure and trusted data exchange, which is governed by an institutionalized alliance of different stakeholder organizations. The paper delivers insights gained during the early stages of the platform’s lifecycle (i.e. the platform design process). More specifically, it provides answers to three research questions, namely how alliance-driven MSPs come into existence and evolve, how different stakeholder groups use certain governance mechanisms during the platform design process, and how this process is influenced by regulatory instruments. By contrasting the case of an alliance-driven MSP with the more common approach of the keystone-driven MSP, the results of the case study suggest that different evolutionary paths can be pursued during the early stages of an MSP’s lifecycle. Furthermore, the IDS initiative considers trust and data sovereignty more relevant regulatory instruments compared to pricing, for example. Finally, the study advances the body of scientific knowledge with regard to data being a boundary resource on MSPs.","Alliance-driven platform, Case study research, Data resource, Data sovereignty, International Data Spaces, Multi-sided data platform",,,,,,,,"<Ecosystem as structure, {eid: 85004107267, doi: 10.1177/0149206316678451}>, <The architecture of platforms: A unified view, {eid: 71949126345}>, <Investigating information systems with action research, {eid: 0002437413}>, <Developing multi-sided platforms for public-private information sharing, {eid: 84880563255}>, <Open platform strategies and innovation: granting access vs. devolving control, {eid: 77958033399, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.1100.1215}>, <Platform rules: multi-sided platforms as regulators, {eid: 77958062188}>, <Data Provenance: Some Basic Issues, {eid: 84947733945, doi: 10.1007/3-540-44450-5_6}>, <The evolution of platform thinking, {eid: 73649131660, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629189}>, <The role of platform boundary resources in software ecosystems: A case study, {eid: 84903734525}>, <The digital platform: a research agenda, {eid: 85018241471, doi: 10.1057/s41265-016-0033-3}>, <Defining architecture components of the big data ecosystem, {eid: 84906250101}>, <Generalizability and the single-case study, {eid: 0002228543}>, <None, {eid: 41849141359}>, <Distributed tuning of boundary resources: the case of Apples iOS service system, {eid: 84939781260, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2015/39.1.10}>, <Opening platforms: how, when and why?, {eid: 77958042047}>, <None, {eid: 85063569734}>, <The antitrust economics of multi-sided platform markets, {eid: 33846819331}>, <None, {eid: 84923304921, doi: 10.3386/w18783}>, <From databases to dataspaces, {eid: 31444453796, doi: 10.1145/1107499.1107502}>, <Platform dynamics and strategies: from products to services, {eid: 85040190478, doi: 10.4337/9781849803311}>, <Bridging differing perspectives on technological platforms: Toward an integrative framework, {eid: 84902550958, doi: 10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006}>, <Industry platforms and ecosystem innovation, {eid: 84898004011, doi: 10.1111/jpim.12105}>, <Governing third-party development through platform boundary resources, {eid: 84870963683}>, <A paradigmatic analysis of digital application marketplaces, {eid: 84939806687, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.16}>, <Context interchange: new features and formalisms for the intelligent integration of information, {eid: 0000876805, doi: 10.1145/314516.314520}>, <Two-sided platforms: product variety and pricing structures, {eid: 70350278738, doi: 10.1111/j.1530-9134.2009.00236.x}>, <Principles of dataspace systems, {eid: 34250660624}>, <VoCol: An Integrated Environment to Support Version-Controlled Vocabulary Development, {eid: 84997132390, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_20}>, <The generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution, {eid: 84887414769, doi: 10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.3.11}>, <A Policy Language for Distributed Usage Control, {eid: 38049040380, doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-74835-9_35}>, <Requirements engineering as a success factor in software projects, {eid: 0035393371, doi: 10.1109/MS.2001.936219}>, <Requirements of an open data based business ecosystem, {eid: 84910094976, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2302872}>, <Data-centric intelligent information integration—from concepts to automation, {eid: 84949106206, doi: 10.1007/s10844-014-0340-5}>, <Towards a policy enforcement infrastructure for distributed usage control, {eid: 84864041384}>, <Designing data governance, {eid: 73649138928, doi: 10.1145/1629175.1629210}>, <Energy disclosure, market behavior, and the building data ecosystem, {eid: 84881546623, doi: 10.1111/nyas.12163}>, <None, {eid: 85050213166}>, <A review and future direction of agile, business intelligence, analytics and data science, {eid: 84966326638, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.04.013}>, <Towards a user-centric personal data ecosystem: The role of the bank of individuals data, {eid: 84871909125}>, <Management of the master data lifecycle: a framework for analysis, {eid: 84879700770, doi: 10.1108/JEIM-05-2013-0026}>, <The impact of openness on the market potential of multi-sided platforms: a case study of mobile payment platforms, {eid: 84939798226, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.7}>, <None, {eid: 85007218223}>, <None, {eid: 85020490036}>, <None, {eid: 85072047817}>, <Open source as enabler for OPC UA in industrial automation, {eid: 84952898892}>, <A design science research methodology for information systems research, {eid: 39749104751, doi: 10.2753/MIS0742-1222240302}>, <Distributed usage control, {eid: 33748543201, doi: 10.1145/1151030.1151053}>, <The theory contribution of case study research designs, {eid: 85050626091, doi: 10.1007/s40685-017-0045-z}>, <FIWARE Open Source Standard Platform in Smart Farming -

All rights reserved.Goal: The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of inserting a collaborative robot in a production line of a factory of the automotive sector. Design / Methodology / Approach: Two simulation environments were developed. The first one models the original operation without the collaborative robot. The second one evaluates the impact of inserting the robot. This work is quantitative. Results: The paper presents the use of digital manufacturing tools in a simulation of a collaborative operation between a human and a collaborative robot. The simulations with and without the collaborative robot were performed, and they make it possible to empha-size the benefits of the collaborative operation in a real production line. Limitations of the investigation: The first simulation scenario was validated from the real data provided by the factory. However, the second scenario is a suggestion, emphasizing the benefits of collaborative operation. Implementation of the second scenario was not conducted. Practical implications: Since its completion depended on support from the automotive sector, this work is noticeably practical. The real data used in the first scenario as well as the assumptions made in the second scenario allow one to conclude that it is possible to implement the propositions with the collaborative robot in the chosen line. Originality / Value: The use of the collaborative robot in Brazil was forbidden by regula-tion until recently. Even in other countries decision makers still find have difficulty decid-ing for this new technology. For this reason, the benefits of using collaborative robots, mainly in Brazilian companies, is still not clear. This work contributes to the collaborative robot discussion and consequently to Industry 4.0 implementation by creating a digital twin of an existing process and inserting a collaborative robot in it. The results should be used by decision makers to decide for inserting this technology in their factories.","Collaborative robotics, Digital manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Integration of a Skill-based Collaborative Mobile Robot in a Smart Cyber--physical Environment, {eid: 85029951065}>, <Formal model of human erroneous behavior for safety analysis in collaborative robotics, {eid: 85059693851}>, <Dynamic task classifica-tion and assignment for the management of human-robot collaborative teams in workcells, {eid: 85049641196}>, <Learning-based endovascular navigation through the use of non-rigid registration for collaborative robotic cathe-terization, {eid: 85045278827}>, <Interactive Simulation of Human-robot Collaboration Using a Force Feed-back Device, {eid: 85029889560}>, <Industrie 4.0: Hit or Hype?, {eid: 84903134983}>, <Language-free graphical signa-ge improves human performance and reduces anxiety when working collaboratively with robots, {eid: 85053812237}>, <Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios, {eid: 84975454820}>, <None, {eid: 0003884788}>, <None, {eid: 0004253213}>, <None, {eid: 85060532808}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Security framework for industrial collaborative robotic cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85042714903}>, <A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing sys-tems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Past, present and future of Industry 4.0-a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal, {eid: 85018651607}>, <A framework for human collaborative robots, operations in South African automotive industry, {eid: 84962018637}>, <Flexible programming and orchestration of collaborative robotic manufacturing systems, {eid: 85055563658}>, <None, {eid: 85147182923}>, <Application of mixed reality in robot manipulator programming, {eid: 85058018578}>, <Hu-man-oriented design of collaborative robots, {eid: 85007487613}>, <How connectivity and search for producers impact production in industry 4.0 networks, {eid: 85095680577}>, <Industry 4.0: glitter or gold?

We claim that these directions can be effectively and efficiently addressed through the adoption of innovative quality-aware edge cloud computing platforms for the design, implementation, and runtime support of distributed AI solutions that execute on both global cloud resources and edge nodes in industrial plant premises. In particular, the paper presents the first experiences that we are doing within the framework of the H2020 Innovation Action IoTwins, for the implementation and optimization of distributed hybrid twins in the IIoT application domains of predictive maintenance and manufacturing optimization. IoTwins exploits distributed hybrid twins, partly executing at edge cloud nodes in industrial plant localities, to perform process/fault predictions and manufacturing line reconfigurations under time constraints, also by enabling some forms of sovereignty on industrial monitoring data.

Such systems help reduce complexity for operators by automating data integration tasks and recommending actions. However, these systems are sometimes flawed. It is not sufficiently understood whether, when and why operators comply with such systems in erroneous or correct cases. We empirically investigate compliance with correct and defective DSSs, the influence of correct and erroneous DSS's on performance and subjective factors related to compliance. In the study, a business game was used as an experimental setting in which 40 users took part. The impact of system correctness on user acceptance, trust, compliance and overall performance was investigated. The results show that the defective system reduces trust in automation (−47%), reduces usefulness (−58%), reduces acceptance (−62%) and reduces overall performance (−32%). Overall, the defective system was less user-friendly (−27%). Nevertheless, users who rated the system's usability higher, outperformed users who rated it lower. Usability is therefore an intermediary that compensates for the negative influence of erroneous DSSs.","automation bias, business simulation game, Decision support system, supply chain management, technology acceptance, trust in automation, usability",,,,,,,,"<The Theory of Planned Behavior, {eid: 44949274046, doi: 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}>, <Understanding Age Differences in PDA Acceptance and Performance, {eid: 34249947611, doi: 10.1016/j.chb.2006.06.005}>, <Ironies of Automation, {eid: 0020843464, doi: 10.1016/0005-1098(83)90046-8}>, <Self-Efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency, {eid: 33746878674, doi: 10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122}>, <Kontrollüberzeugungen im Umgang mit Technik Locus of Control when Interacting with Technology, {eid: 0345388189}>, <The Efficacy of Business Simulation Games in Creating Decision Support Systems: An Experimental Investigation, {eid: 76849117289, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2010.01.002}>, <Measuring the Perceived Effectiveness of Decision Support Systems and their Impact on Performance, {eid: 84868640683, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.033}>, <An Empirically Derived Agenda of Critical Research Issues for Managing Supply-Chain Disruptions, {eid: 27844542118, doi: 10.1080/00207540500151549}>, <The Future of Construction Automation: Technological Disruption and the Upcoming Ubiquity of Robotics, {eid: 84944442053, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.022}>, <None, {eid: 84978863655}>, <None, {eid: 85075090527}>, <A Game-Based Approach to Meet the Challenges of Decision Processes in Ramp-Up Management, {eid: 84958191101, doi: 10.1080/10686967.2016.11918462}>, <None, {eid: 84986277922}>, <None, {eid: 85062367303}>, <None, {eid: 85062329889}>, <How Virtualization, Decentralization and Network Building Change the Manufacturing Landscape: An Industry 4.0 Perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Cognitive Load Theory and the Format of Instruction, {eid: 84948512218, doi: 10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2}>, <Evaluating AmazonS Mechanical Turk as a Tool for Experimental Behavioral Research, {eid: 84874841717, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0057410}>, <The New Statistics: Why and How, {eid: 84891940182, doi: 10.1177/0956797613504966}>, <Automated Decision Making Comes of Age, {eid: 23444456914}>, <Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology, {eid: 55249087535, doi: 10.2307/249008}>, <Simulation Games in Engineering Education: A State-of-the-Art Review, {eid: 78149303408, doi: 10.1002/cae.20323}>, <The Effects of Errors on System Trust, Self-Confidence, and the Allocation of Control in Route Planning, {eid: 0038615897, doi: 10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00039-9}>, <None, {eid: 0032689906}>, <None, {eid: 0004278738}>, <Towards Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems in Production Networks, {eid: 84883852241, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2013.05.009}>, <Effects of Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems on Practitioner Performance and Patient Outcomes: A Systematic Review, {eid: 14544305532, doi: 10.1001/jama.293.10.1223}>, <None, {eid: 0003718482}>, <Automation Bias: A systematic Review of Frequency, Effect Mediators, and Mitigators, {eid: 84856788472, doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089}>, <None, {eid: 0003398482}>, <A Framework For Management Information Systems, {eid: 0002959189}>, <Foundations for an Empirically Determined Scale of Trust in Automated System, {eid: 0001803767, doi: 10.1207/S15327566IJCE0401_04}>, <The Role of Human Factors in Agile Supply Chains, {eid: 57349097261, doi: 10.1504/EJIE.2009.021582}>, <On Effect Size, {eid: 84866442229, doi: 10.1037/a0028086}>, <Managing Disruption Risks in Global Supply Chains, {eid: 19844381688, doi: 10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00009.x}>, <None, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect, {eid: 0031108822, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.43.4.546}>, <Trust in Automation: Designing for Appropriate Reliance, {eid: 85010007963, doi: 10.1518/hfes.46.1.50.30392}>, <The Role of Absorptive Capacity, Communication and Trust in ERP Adoption, {eid: 84973925883, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2016.05.025}>, <None, {eid: 85062326574}>, <Cyber-Physical Production Systems: Roots, Expectations and R&D Challenges, {eid: 84904510850, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2014.03.115}>, <Chapter 10: Human Decision Makers and Automated Decision Aids: Made for Each Other?, {eid: 85052397348}>, <Trust in Automation.

Open source technology can comprise of software, hardware and hybrid solutions that nowadays drive Smart Manufacturing. The major potential of open source technology in Smart Manufacturing lies in enabling interoperability and in reducing the capital costs of designing and implementing new manufacturing solutions. After presenting our motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes with research questions to be addressed in the future.","Digital Twin, micro-services architecture, open source technology, Smart CPS",,,,,,,,"<A Semantic-Based Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) Discovery and Selection System, {eid: 84893669179, doi: 10.1177/1753193412446112}>, <Characterization of Hadoop Jobs Using Unsupervised Learning, {eid: 79952469495, doi: 10.1109/CloudCom.2010.20}>, <Ontology-Based Reconfiguration Agent for Intelligent Mechatronic Systems in Flexible Manufacturing, {eid: 77955665456, doi: 10.1016/j.rcim.2009.12.001}>, <A Systematic Approach to Developing Ontologies for Manufacturing Service Modeling, {eid: 84893737237, doi: 10.1094/PDIS-11-11-0999-PDN}>, <Learning Significant Locations and Predicting User Movement with GPS, {eid: 84952004685, doi: 10.1109/ISWC.2002.1167224}>, <Using GPS to Learn Significant Locations and Predict Movement across Multiple Users, {eid: 84875644869, doi: 10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0}>, <Ontology-Driven Adaptive Sensor Networks.

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,9/25/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661

One of these new concepts is the Digital Twin, which recently started gaining momentum, and is related to creating a virtual copy of the physical system, providing a connection between the real and virtual systems to collect and analyze and simulate data in the virtual model to improve the performance of the real system. The benefits of using the digital twin approach is attracting significant attention and interest from research and industry communities in the last few years, and its importance will increase in the upcoming years. Having this in mind, this paper surveys and discusses the digital twin concept in the context of the 4th industrial revolution, particularly focusing the concept and functionalities, the associated technologies, the industrial applications and the research challenges. The applicability of the digital concept is illustrated by the virtualisation of an UR3 collaborative robot which used the V-REP simulation environment and the Modbus communication protocol.","Digital Twin, Industry 4.0, Simulation, Virtualisation",,,,,,,,"<Securing the future of German manufacturing industry: Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4. 0, {eid: 84926018987}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063}>, <None, {eid: 84940453073}>, <None, {eid: 85079049535}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <Predictive manufacturing system-trends of next-generation production systems, {eid: 85079047775}>, <Product avatar as digital counterpart of a physical individual product: Literature review and implications in an aircraft, {eid: 84975691204}>, <Innovations in digital modelling for next generation manufacturing system design, {eid: 85018625620}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <None, {eid: 85070599797}>, <None, {eid: 85079035130}>, <Feasibility of an immersive digital twin, {eid: 85079069337}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Industry 4. 0 and the power of the digital twin, {eid: 85028754996}>, <Digital twins speed up the commissioning process, {eid: 85079053004}>, <None, {eid: 85079065371}>, <None, {eid: 85079052784}>, <None, {eid: 85079045921}>, <None, {eid: 85079055642}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85079066400}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,7/22/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079042229

Ltd.>, <Big Data & IoT Business Development Unit, Lenovo Capital & Incubator Group>",,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdDigital twins, along with the internet of things (IoT), data mining, and machine learning technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of today's manufacturing paradigm toward intelligent manufacturing. Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry.","digital twin, internet of things, machine learning, petrochemical industry, production control

To parallelize event processing and produce near-real-Time insights over data streams, Digital Twin should be implemented based on an Event-Driven architecture. The Event-Driven architecture is loosely-coupled by its nature. One of the recent possible solutions for loose coupling system is a Microservice approach, a cohesive and independent process that interacts using messages. Stateless behavior is the nature of the microservice, but on the other hand, the vast majority of stream processing in Digital Twin imply stateful operations. Thus, in this paper, we propose a case-study of the possibility to use Apache Kafka Stream API (Kafka stream DSL) to build stateful microservice for real-Time manufacturing data analysis. Also, in the presented work we discuss the fulfillment of such requirements as fault tolerance, processing latency, and scalability to support the stateful stream processing in Digital Twins implementation.","Apache Kafka, Digital Twin, Event-Driven, Microservice, Sensors, Stream processing",,,,,,,,"<Impact of Quality of Service on Cloud Based Industrial IoT Applications with OPC UA, {eid: 85050353024}>, <The Ring Buffer Network Bus (RBNB) DataTurbine Streaming Data Middleware for Environmental Observing Systems, {eid: 44949167512}>, <IoT-Based Intelligent Perception and Access of Manufacturing Resource Toward Cloud Manufacturing, {eid: 84896964757}>, <Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0: Final report of the Industrie 4.0 Working Group, {eid: 84920960599}>, <The Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <A Survey of Research on Cloud Robotics and Automation, {eid: 84924680020}>, <Scientific Micro-Workflows : Where Event-Driven Approach Meets Workflows to Support Digital Twins, {eid: 85079035724}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Micro-Workflows: Kafka and Kepler Fusion to Support Digital Twins of Industrial Processes, {eid: 85061769858}>, <A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <A Survey on Platoon-Based Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 84962359205}>, <Event Driven Architecture, {eid: 84925655451}>, <Event-Driven Architecture Overview, {eid: 50249137591}>, <Microservices validation: Mjolnirr platform case study, {eid: 84946103342}>, <None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <None, {eid: 84963909685}>, <None, {eid: 84930678109}>, <None, {eid: 84886745724}>, <Cloud migration process-A survey, evaluation framework, and open challenges, {eid: 84978904039}>, <None, {eid: 85061791641}>, <None, {eid: 84871553314}>, <A Distributed Stream Processing based Architecture for IoT Smart Grids Monitoring, {eid: 85058316182}>, <DEBS Grand Challenge : Real time Load Prediction and Outliers Detection using STORM, {eid: 84903165991}>, <None, {eid: 85079041361}>, <None, {eid: 84904332358}>, <Real-Time Anomaly Detection from Environmental Data Streams, {eid: 84945960187}>, <None, {eid: 85066493383}>, <A high throughput processing engine for taxi-generated data streams, {eid: 84960948972}>, <None, {eid: 85079070119}>, <None, {eid: 85079068100}>, <None, {eid: 85079056786}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <A Systematic Mapping Study in Microservice Architecture, {eid: 85011262976}>, <None, {eid: 85079055714}>, <None, {eid: 84923680682}>, <None, {eid: 85057008293}>, <None, {eid: 85079059100}>, <None, {eid: 85079055636}>, <None, {eid: 85079037690}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,10/21/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079071242

Since its first introduction in 2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of applications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial intelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.","Cyber-physical system, Digital twin, Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <A software-defined framework for the integrated management of smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 85039453232}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <None, {eid: 85081157087}>, <Integrated tool chain for model-based design of cyber-physical systems: The into-cps project, {eid: 84983000693}>, <Systemj: A gals language for system level design, {eid: 77957879241}>, <Grl: A specification language for globally asynchronous locally synchronous systems, {eid: 84908701663}>, <Multiclock esterel, {eid: 84947206586}>, <The esterel synchronous programming language: Design, semantics, implementation, {eid: 0026953373}>, <None, {eid: 0003418449}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <None, {eid: 85081154629}>, <The temporal semantics of concurrent programs, {eid: 49149133038}>, <Automationml\-The glue for seamless automation engineering, {eid: 56349149489}>, <A structural approach to operational semantics, {eid: 2942572885}>, <None, {eid: 4644222521}>, <None, {eid: 0003654667}>, <Iopt-tools-A web based tool framework for embedded systems controller development using petri nets, {eid: 84898668110}>, <Online rotor mixed fault diagnosis way based on spectrum analysis of instantaneous power in squirrel cage induction motors, {eid: 4544373211}>, <Fault identification for robot manipulators, {eid: 27144485807}>, <Sampling-based motion planning with temporal goals, {eid: 77955794699}>, <Monitoring temporal properties of continuous signals, {eid: 27944453169}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/17/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081154595

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period.","Building Information Model (BIM), Energy saving, Green Building, Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast), {eid: 84855440065}>, <None, {eid: 78649784171}>, <Re (De) fining Net Zero Energy: Renewable Emergy Balance in environmental building design, {eid: 80052798303}>, <Case study of zero energy house design in UK, {eid: 69249208690}>, <None, {eid: 84858075740}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework, {eid: 84858071872}>, <Getting to net zero, {eid: 70349634940}>, <None, {eid: 79957854089}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies, {eid: 79951517816}>, <Net Zero Energy Homes of the Future: A Case Study of the écoTerraTM House in Canada, {eid: 79951510163}>, <Goal zero energy building-Exemplary experience based on the solar estate Solarsiedlung Freiburg am Schlierberg, {eid: 85059350562}>, <Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings: An Overview and Analysis onWorldwide Building Projects, {eid: 79955146310}>, <Check and evaluation system on heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of china based on multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, {eid: 64749088443}>, <None, {eid: 82055194442}>, <Renewable Substitutability Index: Maximizing Renewable Resource Use in Building, {eid: 84958761582}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status, {eid: 84886457808}>, <Evaluation of net-zero energy residential buildings in the MENA region, {eid: 84961784216}>, <None, {eid: 78349265716}>, <None, {eid: 85059349047}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition Preprint, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings Criteria for Definition of Net Zero Energy Buildings, {eid: 84869864963}>, <None, {eid: 2242442162}>, <A CAD-based Approach to Embodied Energy Impact Modelling for Housing Design, {eid: 31044437419}>, <None, {eid: 31044449208}>, <Capital Energy Costs of Building and Recycling of Building Materials, {eid: 85059341810}>, <None, {eid: 85059348486}>, <None, {eid: 85059341528}>, <None, {eid: 85059345027}>, <Life cycle cost and energy analysis of a Net Zero Energy House with solar combisystem, {eid: 77957315695}>, <From net energy to zero energy buildings: Defining life cycle zero energy buildings (LC-ZEB), {eid: 77950299775}>, <How to define nearly net zero energy buildings nZEB, {eid: 84858075626}>, <A through-life evaluation of end-of-life rolling stocks considering asset recycling, energy recovering, and financial benefit, {eid: 85059297387}>, <Designing net-zero energy buildings for the future climate, not for the past, {eid: 84860435670}>, <None, {eid: 85059349691}>, <On-site or off-site renewable energy supply options?

This paper proposes to illustrate optional solutions to allow existing buildings to achieve NZEB goals. The aim of this study is to investigate factors that can improve existing building performance to be in line with the NZEB concept and be more sustainable. An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16%, 10.16%, and 14.65%, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future.","BIM, Digital twin, Existing building, Net Zero Energy Building, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2017, {eid: 84894378197}>, <Towards Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings Definition of Common Principles under the EPBD-Final Report, {eid: 84906815954}>, <A Digital-Twin Evaluation of Net Zero Energy Building for Existing Buildings., {eid: 85059346336}>, <Zero Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition, {eid: 37249010887}>, <Net zero energy buildings: A consistent definition framework., {eid: 84858071872}>, <Energy efficient design of building: A review., {eid: 84860223899}>, <Design of a Sustainable Building: A Conceptual Framework for Implementing Sustainability in the Building Sector., {eid: 85077711816}>, <Energy and Sustainable Strategies in the renovation of existing buildings: An Italian Case Study., {eid: 85197038195}>, <Integrated life cycle assessment and thermodynamic simulation of a public buildings envelope renovation: Conventional vs. Passivhaus proposal, {eid: 85040317509}>, <Regenerative Design of Existing Buildings for Net-Zero Energy Use., {eid: 84948443104}>, <Optical and thermal characterization of multiple glazed windows with low U-values., {eid: 0028413030}>, <Annual thermal evaluation of a double pane window using glazing available in the Mexican market., {eid: 85050146968}>, <Thermal analysis of triple and quadruple windows using partitioning radiant energy veils? with different physical and optical properties, {eid: 85055081957}>, <None, {eid: 85082943441}>, <None, {eid: 85082946648}>, <None, {eid: 85082929946}>, <None, {eid: 85082969997}>, <None, {eid: 85082946095}>, <None, {eid: 85082962564}>, <Zero Energy Building-A review of definitions and calculation methodologies., {eid: 79951517816}>, <Integration of renewable energy technology in building., {eid: 80055005162}>, <Integrating renewable energy technologies to support building trigeneration-A multi-criteria analysis., {eid: 84155166959}>, <Comprehensive use of renewable energy in building., {eid: 84884810513}>, <Improving the renewable energy mix in a building toward the nearly zero energy status., {eid: 84886457808}>, <None, {eid: 85082974517}>, <None, {eid: 85082946262}>, <None, {eid: 85082963190}>, <None, {eid: 85082953929}>, <None, {eid: 85082975916}>, <Control system and energy saving potential for switchable windows, {eid: 0011876305}>, <None, {eid: 85082974334}>, <None, {eid: 85082965652}>, <None, {eid: 85082958499}>, <None, {eid: 85082943998}>, <None, {eid: 85082962096}>, <None, {eid: 85082975572}>, <None, {eid: 85082926162}>, <Thermal properties optimization of envelope in energy-saving renovation of existing public buildings., {eid: 84896530062}>, <None, {eid: 85082925511}>, <None, {eid: 85082922233}>, <None, {eid: 85082932259}>, <None, {eid: 85082961571}>, <None, {eid: 85082974641}>, <None, {eid: 85082933534}>, <None, {eid: 85082927574}>, <None, {eid: 85082942378}>, <Grand challenges in transportation and transit systems., {eid: 84997615254}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85082879525

Currently, most existing vulnerability-assessment techniques mostly rely on only the security department due to limited communication between different working groups. This poses a limitation to the security management of CPPSs, as malicious operations may use new exploits that occur between successive analysis milestones or across departmental managerial boundaries. Thus, it is important to study and analyse CPPS networks’ security, in terms of vulnerability analysis that accounts for humans in the production process loop, to prevent potential threats to infiltrate through cross-layer gaps and to reduce the magnitude of their impact. We propose a semantic framework that supports the collaboration between different actors in the production process, to improve situation awareness for cyberthreats prevention. Stakeholders with different expertise are contributing to vulnerability assessment, which can be further combined with attack-scenario analysis to provide more practical analysis. In doing so, we show through a case study evaluation how our proposed framework leverages crucial relationships between vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, in order to narrow further the risk-window induced by discoverable vulnerabilities.","Cyber-physical production system security, Human-in-the-Loop, Reference model, Semantic model, Vulnerability assessment",,,,,,,,"<Cybersecurity for digital manufacturing, {eid: 85044852236}>, <A brief study of Wannacry Threat: Ransomware attack 2017, {eid: 85042754144}>, <None, {eid: 85082104455}>, <A survey of approaches to automatic schema matching, {eid: 0035657983}>, <Cyber-physical systems security-a survey, {eid: 85029396841}>, <An integrated cyber security risk management approach for a cyber-physical system, {eid: 85047820238}>, <A language and repository for cyber security of smart grids, {eid: 85059076918}>, <SECTET: An extensible framework for the realization of secure inter-organizational workflows, {eid: 33750453781}>, <Quantitative information security risk estimation using probabilistic attack graphs, {eid: 85018370233}>, <A cyber-physical attack taxonomy for production systems: A quality control perspective, {eid: 85043396479}>",,,Springer,,,10/29/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85082136847

Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.","Evidence-based software engineering, Grey literature, Guidelines, Literature study, Multivocal literature review, Systematic literature review, Systematic mapping study",,,,,,,,"<Evidence-based software engineering, {eid: 4544225764}>, <Systematic literature reviews in software engineering–a systematic literature review, {eid: 56649086628}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: an update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <Using systematic review methods within a Ph.D. dissertation in political science: challenges and lessons learned from practice, {eid: 84901686086}>, <Software test-code engineering: a systematic mapping, {eid: 84914181487}>, <Including systematic reviews in PhD programmes and candidatures in nursing – ‘Hobsons choice’?, {eid: 84897595016}>, <Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis: understanding the best evidence in primary healthcare, {eid: 84939214241}>, <The role of systematic reviews in evidence-based practice, research, and development, {eid: 49049110198}>, <What we know about testing embedded software, {eid: 85049807004}>, <Software Creativity 2.0, {eid: 80053507768}>, <Experimentation in Software Engineering, {eid: 84949178783}>, <Towards rigor in reviews of multivocal literatures: applying the exploratory case study method, {eid: 84970133401}>, <Towards utility in reviews of multivocal literatures, {eid: 84970277709}>, <The use of grey literature in health sciences: a preliminary survey, {eid: 0025202504}>, <Grey literature searching for Health Sciences Systematic Reviews: a prospective study of time spent and resources utilized, {eid: 84907152613}>, <Grey literature in meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care interventions, {eid: 35549006513}>, <Shades of grey: guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 85031698784}>, <An exploration of technical debt, {eid: 84876410801}>, <None, {eid: 85053865931}>, <Does the inclusion of grey literature influence estimates of intervention effectiveness reported in meta-analyses?, {eid: 0034619036}>, <Systematic mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 85088075417}>, <None, {eid: 85057390331}>, <Grey literature, {eid: 84856535970}>, <Searching for studies, {eid: 84883710616}>, <Finding the hard to finds: searching for grey (Gray) literature, {eid: 85053884408}>, <Global epidemiology of injecting drug use and HIV among people who inject drugs: a systematic review, {eid: 55749095381}>, <Evidence-Based Software Engineering and Systematic Reviews, {eid: 85140160476}>, <Investigating bias in the search phase of Software Engineering secondary studies, {eid: 84936076379}>, <A systematic literature review of literature reviews in software testing, {eid: 84987968030}>, <Citations, research topics and active countries in software engineering: a bibliometrics study, {eid: 84959387510}>, <A bibliometric analysis of the Turkish software engineering research community, {eid: 84942987899}>, <Quantity versus impact of software engineering papers: a quantitative study, {eid: 85020729509}>, <What we know about testing embedded software, {eid: 85049807004}>, <A systematic mapping study of web application testing, {eid: 84878316262}>, <Graphical User Interface (GUI) Testing: systematic Mapping and Repository, {eid: 84880786120}>, <UML-Driven Software Performance Engineering: a Systematic Mapping and Trend Analysis, {eid: 84943001475}>, <A grey literature review of special events for promoting cancer screenings, {eid: 84902702380}>, <Why children are not vaccinated: a review of the grey literature, {eid: 84870248721}>, <A grey literature review of the cultural Olympiad, {eid: 85048901603}>, <Reconceptualizing cultural participation in Europe: grey literature review, {eid: 84884500365}>, <The need for multivocal literature reviews in software engineering: complementing systematic literature reviews with grey literature, {eid: 84978496329}>, <Choosing the right test automation tool: a grey literature review, {eid: 85039445491}>, <Software test maturity assessment and test process improvement: a multivocal literature review, {eid: 85009743225}>, <When and what to automate in software testing?

All rights reserved.In manufacturing, concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) accelerate the development from traditional production facilities towards smart factories. Thereby, emerging digital technologies increasingly connect information networks with production processes, forming complex smart factory networks. Due to their reliance on information flows and the high degree of cross-linking, these networks are, in particular, vulnerable to availability risks caused by attacks and errors. To address this problem, we aim to identify and analyse availability threats by developing a modelling approach that depicts specific characteristics of smart factory networks. Based on modelling requirements derived from a literature review, we propose a modular Petri net approach. To iteratively revise and validate our model, we followed established evaluation principles and conducted evaluation rounds with industry experts and other researchers. To demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of our model, we simulated one real-world use case and two planned extensions of a mechanical engineering company. Our model depicts information-based dependencies within smart factory networks and allows for the simulation and analysis of threat propagation. Thereby, it enables both researchers and practitioners to identify critical network connections and components, serving as a basis for layout decisions and IT security mitigation measures.","Attack Propagation, Availability Risks, Information Network, Petri Nets, Production Network, Smart Factory Network",,,,,,,,"<In quest of benchmarking security risks to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84873293533}>, <When is it unavailability a strategic risk?: A study in the context of cloud computing, {eid: 85107713317}>, <Supply chain modelling and its analytical evaluation, {eid: 0036682210}>, <None, {eid: 0345860166}>, <Petri net control of an automated manufacturing cell, {eid: 0024901564}>, <How virtualization, decentralization and network building change the manufacturing landscape: An industry 4.0 perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Cyber-physical systems: Imminent challenges, {eid: 84868369465}>, <None, {eid: 85071149909}>, <Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks, {eid: 77951126500}>, <Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 51849091527}>, <Challenges for securing cyber physical systems, {eid: 80055028776}>, <Coloured petri nets extended with place capacities, test arcs and inhibitor arcs, {eid: 85029434486}>, <None, {eid: 84987795037}>, <Cyber physical systems design, methodology, and integration: The current status and future outlook, {eid: 85049585351}>, <Free choice Petri nets, {eid: 0003947126}>, <None, {eid: 85085936534}>, <A generalized stochastic Petri net model for management of distributed manufacturing systems, {eid: 33847191765}>, <A survey of Petri net applications in modeling controls for automated manufacturing systems, {eid: 0028430873}>, <Reset nets between decidability and undecidability, {eid: 84878552622}>, <Investigation of exogenous shocks in complex supply networks -

As Industry 4.0 is the relatively new concept originated from an advanced manufacturing vision supported by the German government in 2011, there are only several existing surveys on either cyber physical systems or big data in Industry 4.0. In addition, there are much less surveys related to the intersection between cyber physical systems and big data in Industry 4.0. However, cyber physical systems are closely related to big data in nature. For example, cyber physical systems will continuously generate a large amount of data which requires the big data techniques to process and help to improve system scalability, security, and efficiency. Therefore, we conduct this survey to bring more attention to this critical intersection and highlight the future research direction to achieve the fully autonomy in Industry 4.0.","big data, cloud

Model inference techniques can be categorized as active or passive learning, constructing models by (dynamically) interacting with systems or (statically) analyzing traces, respectively. Application of those techniques in the industry is, however, hindered by the trade-off between learning time and completeness achieved (active learning) or by incomplete input logs (passive learning). We investigate the learning time/completeness achieved trade-off of active learning with a pilot study at ASML, provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. To resolve the trade-off we advocate extending active learning with execution logs and passive learning results.We apply the extended approach to eighteen components used in ASML TWINSCAN lithography machines. Compared to traditional active learning, our approach significantly reduces the active learning time. Moreover, it is capable of learning the behavior missed by the traditional active learning approach.","active learning, equivalence oracle, model inference, passive learning, reverse engineering, runtime logs",,,,,,,,"<Using finitestate models for log differencing, {eid: 85058335840}>, <Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples, {eid: 0023453626}>, <Refining active learning to increase behavioral coverage, {eid: 85064153511}>, <Interface protocol inference to aid understanding legacy software components, {eid: 85063091119}>, <Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, {eid: 0001677717}>, <Never-stop learning: Continuous validation of learned models for evolving systems through monitoring, {eid: 84903886826}>, <On the synthesis of finite-state machines from samples of their behavior, {eid: 84938806379}>, <Inference of regular languages using state merging algorithms with search, {eid: 19944414336}>, <None, {eid: 0003577917}>, <Test selection based on finite state models, {eid: 0026172995}>, <Language identification in the limit, {eid: 49949150022}>, <Formal verification of static software models in MDE: A systematic review, {eid: 84900008517}>, <None, {eid: 85056885539}>, <None, {eid: 0003620778}>, <Hybrid learning: Interface generation through static, dynamic, and symbolic analysis, {eid: 84881300723}>, <The TTT algorithm: A redundancy-free approach to active automata learning, {eid: 84921627713}>, <State-merging DFA induction algorithms with mandatory merge constraints, {eid: 56649105032}>, <Results of the abbadingo one DFA learning competition and a new evidence-driven state merging algorithm, {eid: 84947908042}>, <QUARK: Empirical assessment of automatonbased specification miners, {eid: 34948849748}>, <Learning extended FSA from software: An empirical assessment, {eid: 84863103938}>, <Efficient test-based model generation for legacy reactive systems, {eid: 19944391951}>, <Inferring regular languages in polynomial updated time, {eid: 0002655021}>, <Identifying regular languages in polynomial time, {eid: 0002655021}>, <Black box checking, {eid: 15844378350}>, <LearnLib: A framework for extrapolating behavioral models, {eid: 70350536587}>, <Inference of finite automata using homing sequences, {eid: 0001349185}>, <Guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering, {eid: 61849169018}>, <None, {eid: 85064173388}>, <Applying automata learning to embedded control software, {eid: 84949234963}>, <None, {eid: 85040588157}>, <Bigger is not always better: On the quality of hypotheses in active automata learning, {eid: 84949215167}>, <A survey of grammatical inference in software engineering, {eid: 84908351504}>, <Finite automata: Behavior and synthesis, {eid: 85064149373}>, <Model learning, {eid: 85010790123}>, <Enhancing automata learning by log-based metrics, {eid: 84977490093}>, <None, {eid: 84979530122}>, <Process discovery using integer linear programming, {eid: 77049092374}>, <None, {eid: 85064178054}>, <Flexfringe: A passive automaton learning package, {eid: 85040590726}>, <Inferring finite-state models with temporal constraints, {eid: 56249102132}>, <Automated comparison of statebased software models in terms of their language and structure, {eid: 84876138196}>, <Inferring extended finite state machine models from software executions, {eid: 84925003128}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2/24/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85064164636

Published by Elsevier B.V.More and more elements in a modern production system are becoming smart devices and it is reasonable to integrate them into a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) in a consistent manner. There is the broad goal of many industrial players to open the rich potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which has to be fast, secure and adaptive. The growing number of ""things"" in a production system requires satisfying connectivity solutions that are different to an easy coming ""Peer-to-Peer architecture (P2P)"". The approach followed at the smartfactory@tugraz - the Learning Factory of Graz University of Technology in Austria - to achieve such an integration is to deploy an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), which is at the core of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The goal is to integrate three main software applications including the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the Management Execution System (MES). The additional challenge in this project is that these mentioned main applications are all provided by different suppliers. The selected SOA approach provides the basis for a scalable and extensible solution via Connectivity Modules and standardized interfaces. The smartfactory@tugraz validates this SOA approach by applying it to a real and fully operational manufacturing line. The smartfactory@tugraz is not only a learning factory but rather an open ecosystem by offering both students and researchers as well as industrial partners the ability to perform research on this subject. It is thus the ideal place to study the challenges and to understand the benefits of pushing a CPPS to a mature level in terms of connectivity in a manufacturing context.","Connectivity, CPPS, ESB, OPC UA, Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P), Reference architecture, Service oriented architecture, Smart Factory, SOA Enterprise Service Bus",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise Architectures for the Digital Transformation in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, {eid: 85044637997}>, <Forschungsraum smartfactory@tugraz - Die Sichtbarmachung einer agilen Fertigung, {eid: 85065645479}>, <A critical review of smart manufacturing & Industry 4.0, {eid: 85055904167}>, <None, {eid: 85042671846}>, <None, {eid: 85065647748}>, <SOA and Web Services Interface Design, {eid: 85014273181}>, <Architecting Scalable Enterprise Web Applications, {eid: 85065660830}>, <None, {eid: 33744509965}>, <None, {eid: 85065665480}>, <Enterprise Service Bus, {eid: 85065635720}>, <Loose Coupling, {eid: 85065642717}>, <Whats in a Service?, {eid: 36749076301}>, <None, {eid: 85047244766}>, <None, {eid: 85065658338}>, <None, {eid: 85048818555}>, <Anwendungsbeispiele zur Integration heterogener Steuerungssysteme bei robotergestützten Industrieanlagen, {eid: 85068473205}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,3/26/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85065662522

Manufacturing systems and more specifically assembly systems (ASs) should allow quick adaptation of manufacturing assets so as to respond to the evolving market requirements that lead to mass customization. Meanwhile, the manufacturing era is changing due to the fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, that will change the traditional manufacturing environment to an IoT-based one. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of cyber-physical microservice in the Manufacturing and the ASs domain and presents the Cyber-Physical microservice and IoT-based (CPuS-IoT) framework. The CPuS-IoT framework exploits the benefits of the microservice architectural style and the IoT technologies, but also utilizes the existing in this domain huge investment based on traditional technologies, to support the life cycle of evolvable ASs in the age of Industry 4.0. It provides a solid basis to capture domain knowledge that is used by a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to semi-automate the development, evolution and operation of ASs, as well as, to establish a common vocabulary for assembly system experts and IoT ones. The CPuS-IoT approach and framework effectively combines MDE with IoT and the microservice architectural paradigm. A case study for the assembly of an everyday life product is adopted to demonstrate the approach even to non-experts of this domain.","Assembly systems, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, IoT, Manufacturing system architecture, Microservices",,,,,,,,"<Analysis of the Methods Time Measurement (MTM) Methodology through its Application in Manufacturing Companies, {eid: 85063105349}>, <Decentralized control: Status and outlook, {eid: 84900474912}>, <Decision support for sequence generation in an assembly-oriented design environment, {eid: 2642553127}>, <Future trends in management and operation of assembly systems: From customized assembly systems to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85041918454}>, <Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing, {eid: 84900826011}>, <Assembly system design in the Industry 4.0 era: A general framework, {eid: 85031791393}>, <Multi-objective assembly line balancing considering component picking and ergonomic risk, {eid: 85028698266}>, <None, {eid: 85067527558}>, <IoT-based configurable information service platform for product lifecycle management, {eid: 84900809305}>, <Modelling and simulation of opportunistic IoT services with aggregate computing, {eid: 85053778744}>, <An advanced cyber physical framework for micro devices assembly, {eid: 85028458837}>, <Assembly system configuration through Industry 4.0 principles: The expected change in the actual paradigms, {eid: 85044859693}>, <A software platform for supporting the design and reconfiguration of versatile assembly systems, {eid: 85049560558}>, <A real-time service-oriented architecture for industrial automation, {eid: 69249218873}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Keeping track of the physical in assembly processes, {eid: 84992560957}>, <Toward opportunistic services for the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85044750246}>, <Assembly system design and operations for product variety, {eid: 80051668632}>, <Constraint-based interactive assembly planning, {eid: 0030675394}>, <Practical semantics for the Internet of Things: Physical states, device mashups, and open questions, {eid: 84962216157}>, <Product, process and system ontologies and knowledge base for managing knowledge between different clients, {eid: 70349108400}>, <Intelligent assembly system for mechanical products and key technology based on internet of things, {eid: 84908081564}>, <An ontology for the definition and validation of assembly processes for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 33746589988}>, <An integrated framework for design, management and operation of reconfigurable assembly systems, {eid: 85029542665}>, <None, {eid: 85063092036}>, <Configuration of smart environments made simple: Combining visual modeling with semantic metadata and reasoning, {eid: 84946175320}>, <Going solo: Hierarchical task analysis of the second driver in two-up (multi-person) freight rail operations, {eid: 85043606627}>, <Capability-based task allocation in human-robot collaboration, {eid: 85020859281}>, <Cyber-physical systems alter automation architectures, {eid: 84900498200}>, <AND/OR Graph representation of assembly plans, {eid: 0025418409}>, <None, {eid: 85063075495}>, <Hierarchical task analysis: Developments, applications, and extensions, {eid: 27744434006}>, <Secure integration of IoT and cloud computing, {eid: 85008227599}>, <A novel ontology-based service model for cyber physical system, {eid: 85039910158}>, <Extended liaison as an interface between product and process model in assembly, {eid: 84899671341}>, <Human-robot collaboration in cellular manufacturing: Design and development, {eid: 76249122509}>, <A Cyber-Physical system-based approach for industrial automation systems, {eid: 84931572168}>, <An open distributed architecture for flexible hybrid assembly systems: a model driven engineering approach, {eid: 84946771754}>, <A framework for MDE of IoT-based manufacturing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85063081388}>, <Cyber-physical microservices: An iot-based framework for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85050167602}>, <Towards an IoT-based framework for evolvable assembly systems, {eid: 85106545857}>, <Microservices, {eid: 84922850962}>, <Functional composition of sensor web APIs, {eid: 84892394014}>, <Efficient runtime service discovery and consumption with hyperlinked RESTdesc, {eid: 83755186092}>, <IoT and cloud computing in automation of assembly modelling systems, {eid: 84900815294}>, <Industry 4.0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <AutoAssem: An automated assembly planning system for complex products, {eid: 84864564598}>, <Object-oriented templates for automated assembly planning of complex products, {eid: 84898778091}>, <The internet of things for smart Manufacturing: a Review, IISE transactions, {eid: 85063081450}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,1/1/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85063085792

In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.","Data management framework, Factory floor, Industrial internet of things (IIoT), IoT middleware, Smart factory",,,,,,,,"<Challenges and research issues of data management in IoT for large-scale petrochemical plants, {eid: 85019839931}>, <Future IIOT in process automation-Latest trends of standardization in industrial automation, {eid: 84960194698}>, <An Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment, {eid: 84892717180}>, <An industrial big data pipeline for data-driven analytics maintenance applications in large-scale smart manufacturing facilities, {eid: 85013959166}>, <Failure detection and prevention for cyber-physical systems using ontology-based knowledge base, {eid: 85059283597}>, <Health assessment and life prediction of cutting tools based on support vector regression, {eid: 84925292228}>, <The evolution and future of manufacturing: A review, {eid: 84963772214}>, <Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems—Reviews, methodology and applications, {eid: 84887056149}>, <None, {eid: 55549116194}>, <None, {eid: 85070538697}>, <Restthing: A restful web service infrastructure for mash-up physical and web resources, {eid: 84862942051}>, <Data management for the Internet of Things: Design primitives and solution, {eid: 84887746858}>, <Middleware for internet of things: A survey, {eid: 84959420432}>, <Distributed data service for data management in internet of things middleware, {eid: 85018349860}>, <Part data integration in the Shop Floor Digital Twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201}>, <Smart factories in Industry 4.0: A review of the concept and of energy management approached in production based on the Internet of Things paradigm, {eid: 84988221092}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395}>, <None, {eid: 85070559440}>, <None, {eid: 84957605573}>, <None, {eid: 85070559277}>, <PwC 20 years inside the mind of the CEO . . .

Not only does the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency secure sustainability through increased energy efficiency but it also improves the efficiency in terms of overall productivity. Dyeing and finishing industries consume massive amounts of energy and have large energy-related expenditures. The industry comprises small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have insufficient capital to pay for the energy-efficient equipment. This study proposes a service-oriented platform that can achieve process and systematic efficiency enhancement based on the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The platform reflects the requirements of dyeing and finishing shops in the industry and secures effective interoperability and services using a service-oriented architectural design. A smart operation enabled by the service-oriented platform to improve the efficiency of traditional processes is developed. The system architecture, P4R data model, and service composition are discussed to understand the proposed process. Results suggest that it is possible to provide dyeing and finishing shops with services for reducing energy costs and improving productivity. The proposed platform also provides high-level services that utilize analytical techniques and data from the IIoT, and it serves as a suitable solution for small- and medium-sized enterprises by reducing costs.","Digital twin, dyeing and finishing shop, energy efficiency, industrial Internet of Things, service-oriented architecture, sustainable manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<C2ps: A Digital Twin

Model is the foundation and core of digital twin theories and technologies, but the traditional three-dimension digital twin model can no longer meet the new application requirements and technology development trends. To promote the application of digital twin in more fields, a five-dimension digital twin model was put forward in authors' previous research to digital twin shop-floor. In view of the new demands on digital twin and based on the previous research, a more systematic five-dimension digital twin model was presented. Furthermore, its applications in ten fields were discussed, including satellite/space communication network, ships, vehicles, power plant, aircraft, complex equipment, stereoscopic warehouse, medical, shop-floor and smart city, which could provide theoretical and methodological references for the application of digital twin in the future.","Applications, Digital twin, Five-dimension digital twin model, Ten fields",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85126961301}>, <Digital twin workshop: a new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: a new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152}>, <Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <Digital twin and its potential application exploration, {eid: 85046337978}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85042921933, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2018.1443229}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <Digital twin and big data towards smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: 360 degree comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <IIHub: An Industrial Internet-Of-Things Hub towards Smart Manufacturing Based on Cyber-Physical system, {eid: 85030779624}>, <Equipment energy consumption management in digital twin shop-floor: a framework and potential applications, {eid: 85048222217}>, <Data-driven smart manufacturing, {eid: 85040599054}>, <Connotation, architecture and trends of product digital twin, {eid: 85021844855}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex system, {eid: 85016450943}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.

This paper surveys the recent literature on data management as it applies to networked industrial environments and identifies several open research challenges for the future. As a first step, we extract important data properties (volume, variety, traffic, and criticality) and identify the corresponding data enabling technologies of diverse fundamental industrial use cases, based on practical applications. Second, we provide a detailed outline of recent industrial architectural designs with respect to their data management philosophy (data presence, data coordination, and data computation) and the extent of their distributiveness. Then, we conduct a holistic survey of the recent literature from which we derive a taxonomy of the latest advances in industrial data enabling technologies and data centric services, spanning all the way from the field level deep in the physical deployments, up to the cloud and applications level. Finally, motivated by the rich conclusions of this critical analysis, we identify interesting open challenges for future research. The concepts presented in this paper thematically cover the largest part of the industrial automation pyramid layers. Our approach is multidisciplinary, as the selected publications were drawn from two fields; the communications, networking and computation field, and the industrial, manufacturing, and automation field. This paper can help the readers to deeply understand how data management is currently applied in networked industrial environments, and select interesting open research opportunities to pursue.","Data

We focus on robot agents and emphasize the challenges of MAS sub-fields including task decomposition, coalition formation, task allocation, perception, and multi-agent planning and control. While some components have seen more advancements than others, more research is required before effective autonomous MAS can be deployed in real smart city settings that are less restrictive than the assumed validation environments of MAS.

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Cyber-Physical Production System, Digital Twin, Injection molding, Model-driven development, Reference architecture",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shopfloor management system in the ESB logistics learning factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Architectural programming with montiarcautomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <Digital behavioral twins for safe connected cars, {eid: 85056832496}>, <Machinability assessment of inconel 718 by factorial design of experiment coupled with response surface methodology, {eid: 0343168164}>, <Practical applications of Taguchi method for optimization of processing parameters for plastic injection moulding: A retrospective review, {eid: 84923316802}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Constance: an intelligent data lake system, {eid: 84979680970}>, <Injection molding setup by means of machine learning based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85072959161}>, <Combined learning processes for injection moulding based on simulation and experimental data, {eid: 85097342280}>, <Flexibilisation of injection moulding manufacture through digitisation, {eid: 85086233825}>, <Approaches of self-optimising systems in manufacturing, {eid: 85149036760}>, <None, {eid: 85086227181}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <The digital twin implementation for linking the virtual representation of human-based production tasks to their physical counterpart in the factory-floor, {eid: 85054903830}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <None, {eid: 84905811248}>, <Abstraction and refinement in hierarchically decomposable and underspecified CPS-architectures, {eid: 85052702289}>, <Jenseits menschlicher fähigkeiten.

Due to the varied methodologies and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE). The purpose of this article is to provide a cursory description of the SoS basic concepts on the one hand, and then to analyse the main challenges in its development. Finally, we report the literature review showing various techniques and methods that have been modified from the conventional systems engineering to better fit the needs of SoSs design. We hope the findings of this work may encourage and inform the community researchers of the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these large-scale systems. Thus, the complexity of the SoS development lends itself nicely to a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) which provides communication and verification that transcends the levels of development. MBSE uses a model or set of models to document and communicate from the system requirements level down to the software implementation level.","Literature Review, Model-Based Systems Engineering, SoS Engineering, System-of-Systems",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85103812831}>, <None, {eid: 85103824737}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <Understanding the current state of us defense systems of systems and the implications for systems engineering, {eid: 79960988878}>, <Safety in system-of-systems: Ten key challenges, {eid: 84905399824}>, <Framework for managing system-of-systems ilities, {eid: 85062430925}>, <On systems of systems engineering: A requirements engineering perspective and research agenda, {eid: 85056820734}>, <None, {eid: 85103812281}>, <A survey on concepts, applications, and challenges in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84920971178}>, <Understanding transportation as a system-of-systems design problem, {eid: 30744450491}>, <Systems of systems engineering: Basic concepts, model-based techniques, and research directions, {eid: 84942794318}>, <System of systems engineering-new challenges for the 21st century, {eid: 44049101324}>, <None, {eid: 85082395897}>, <Healthcare system of systems, {eid: 47249147628}>, <None, {eid: 84954432139}>, <Systems of systems characterization and types, {eid: 84985885574}>, <Thinking smart cities as systems-of-systems: A perspective study, {eid: 85009437713}>, <1. 4. 3 system of systems pain points, {eid: 85045417936}>, <Towards a system of systems concepts, {eid: 0001217367}>, <Systems of systems test and evaluation challenges, {eid: 77956568147}>, <A model-driven approach for configuring and deploying systems of systems, {eid: 84879765624}>, <Model driven software security architecture of systemsof-systems, {eid: 85018521320}>, <A holistic viewpoint-based sysml profile to design systems-of-systems, {eid: 84962855652}>, <Systems-of-systems modelling using a comprehensive viewpoint-based sysml profile, {eid: 85018602926}>, <System of systems engineering: Meta-modelling perspective, {eid: 85091633953}>, <Towards a rigorous modelling formalism for systems of systems, {eid: 84861494413}>, <Using sysml modelling to understand and evolve systems of systems, {eid: 84872958304}>, <Architecting systemsof-systems and their constituents: A case study applying industry 4. 0 in the construction domain, {eid: 85074593146}>, <Involving the application domain expert in the construction of systems of systems, {eid: 85052328566}>, <An approach to integrate systems towards a directed system-of-systems, {eid: 85055682554}>, <A service-based architecture for virtual and collaborative system of systems, {eid: 85103822730}>, <None, {eid: 84942168293}>, <Developing ontologies for interoperability of systems of systems, {eid: 85103846598}>, <An ontological approach to system of systems engineering inproduct development, {eid: 85092421325}>, <Context-basedontology to describe system-of-systems interoperability, {eid: 84988292015}>, <Ontology-based systems engineering: A state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85071261797}>, <System of systems cyber effects simulation ontology, {eid: 84962920232}>, <A maude based specification for sos architecture, {eid: 85052294614}>, <Formally describing the software architecture of systems-of-systems with sosadl, {eid: 84985906010}>, <Formally describing the architectural behavior of software-intensive systems-of-systems with sosadl, {eid: 85012067003}>, <Calculus for sos: A foundation for formally describing software-intensive systems-of-systems, {eid: 84985963079}>, <A bigraphical multi-scale modelling methodology for system of systems, {eid: 85012303085}>, <System-of-systems support-a bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior, {eid: 84961313278}>, <Bigraph-ensured interoperability for system (-of-systems) emergence, {eid: 84910154287}>, <A tool for modelling sos architectures using bigraphs, {eid: 85020856109}>, <Modelling and simulation of net centric system of systems using systems modelling language and colored petri-nets: A demonstration using the global earth observation system of systems, {eid: 52649148111}>, <A metamodel for representing system-of-systems ontologies, {eid: 85051204692}>, <A service-oriented method for system-of-systems requirements analysis and architecture design, {eid: 84863268266}>, <A model driven service engineering approach to system of systems, {eid: 84902478455}>, <Opm & color petri nets based executable system of systems architecting: A building block in fila-sos, {eid: 84941265214}>, <None, {eid: 67650148256}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,11/28/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85103824540

This raises a gap between the generic modeling languages and the domains of experience of the engineers using these. Engineering truly domain-specific languages (DSLs) for experts of these domains still is too challenging for their wide-spread adoption. One major obstacle, the inability to reuse multi-dimensional (encapsulating constituents of syntax and semantics) language components in a black-box fashion, prevents the effective engineering of novel DSLs. To facilitate engineering DSLs, we devised a concept of 3D components for textual, external, and translational DSLs that relies on systematic reuse through systematic closed and open variability in which DSL syntaxes can be embedded, well-formedness rules joined, and code generators integrated in a black-box fashion. We present this concept, a method for its systematic application, an integrated collection of modeling languages supporting systematic language reuse, and an extensible framework that leverages these languages to derive novel DSLs from language product lines. These can greatly mitigate many of the challenges in DSL reuse and, hence, can advance the engineering of truly domain-specific modeling languages.","DSL, modeling language, reuse, variability",,,,,,,,"<Feature models, grammars, and propositional formulas, {eid: 33646190894}>, <Functional modelling and simulation of overall system ship-virtual methods for engineering and commissioning in shipbuilding, {eid: 84938682810}>, <None, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Variability management with feature models, {eid: 5144222844}>, <The smach high-level executive, {eid: 78650257169}>, <Controlled and extensible variability of concrete and abstract syntax with independent language features, {eid: 85044388976}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <Systematic composition of independent language features, {eid: 85062348521}>, <Modeling reusable, platform-independent robot assembly processes, {eid: 85071365924}>, <Neverlang 2-componentised language development for the jvm, {eid: 84883342791}>, <Variability within modeling language de?nitions, {eid: 77249172339}>, <Conceptual model of the globalization for domain-speci?c languages, {eid: 84951875201}>, <Concern-oriented language development (cold): Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 84958237938}>, <Mind the gap: Lessons learned from translating grammars between monticore and xtext, {eid: 85077180479}>, <Melange: A meta-language for modular and reusable development of dsls, {eid: 84962587279}>, <Automating generation of the assembly line models in aircraft manufacturing simulation, {eid: 84890853908}>, <Xtext-implement your language faster than the quick and dirty way, {eid: 78650158701}>, <Towards e?ective management of inconsistencies in model-based engineering of automated production systems, {eid: 84953867216}>, <None, {eid: 85052020111}>, <The aadl behaviour annex-experiments and roadmap, {eid: 44149092088}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <Using state machines for a model driven development of web service-based sensor network applications, {eid: 77955827775}>, <A comparison of mechanisms for integrating handwritten and generated code for object-oriented programming languages, {eid: 84939532216}>, <None, {eid: 50949102921}>, <Meaningful modeling: Whats the semantics of ""semantics""?, {eid: 7244261750}>, <Integrating ocl and textual modelling languages, {eid: 79957644161}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Software language engineering in the large: Towards composing and deriving languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <Semantic virtual factory supporting interoperable modelling and evaluation of production systems, {eid: 84878842766}>, <Vcu: The three dimensions of reuse, {eid: 84977507448}>, <None, {eid: 67649962577}>, <Choosy and picky: Con?guration of language product lines, {eid: 84982855913}>, <Technological spaces: An initial appraisal, {eid: 18144421716}>, <None, {eid: 84919732308}>, <Feature-oriented language families: A case study, {eid: 84921051501}>, <Gramosa framework for graphical modelling and simulation-based analysis of complex production processes, {eid: 84942371630}>, <None, {eid: 85096984750}>, <None, {eid: 84949846008}>, <Model-based design process for the early phases of manufacturing system planning using sysml, {eid: 85019992214}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Abstract features in feature modeling, {eid: 80054080510}>, <Metaedit+: De?ning and using integrated domain-speci?c modeling languages, {eid: 72249095680}>, <Neverlang: A framework for feature-oriented language development, {eid: 84938739142}>, <Language modularization and composition with projectional language workbenches illustrated with mps, {eid: 81455159767}>, <Language extension and composition with language workbenches, {eid: 78650085881}>, <Language design with the spoofax language workbench, {eid: 84907989410}>, <Improving domain-speci?c language reuse with software product line techniques, {eid: 67650445765}>, <Modeling languages in industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>, <Domain-speci?c metamodelling languages for software language engineering, {eid: 77951542786}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,10/18/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096955321

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud/edge computing integration. This work sets out to be a guide to the status of DT development and application in today’s academic and industrial environment.","Business model, Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Product lifecycle management, Review",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.051}>, <PSS business model conceptualization and application, {eid: 85027857673, doi: 10.1080/09537287.2017.1363924}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.10.003}>, <Cyber-physical system framework for measurement and analysis of physical activities, {eid: 85063520336, doi: 10.3390/electronics8020248}>, <Sustainable and flexible industrial human machine interfaces to support adaptable applications in the Industry 4.0 paradigm, {eid: 85061078981, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1572932}>, <Business models as models, {eid: 77952564431, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.02.005}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1526324}>, <Warehouse management system customization and information availability in 3pl companies: A decision-support tool, {eid: 85053068565, doi: 10.1108/imds-01-2018-0033}>, <Radial basis functions update of digital models on actual manufactured shapes, {eid: 85059948011, doi: 10.1115/1.4041680}>, <Digital twin driven human–robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2019.04.011}>, <Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291, doi: 10.1108/josm-04-2018-0113}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Digital Twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524, doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00031}>, <Digital twins to enhance the integration of ergonomics in the workplace design, {eid: 85061523003, doi: 10.1016/j.ergon.2019.02.001}>, <From strategy to business models and onto tactics, {eid: 77952561844, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.01.004}>, <A supervised machine learning approach to data-driven simulation of resilient supplier selection in digital manufacturing, {eid: 85063342587, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.03.004}>, <Cyber-physical integration for moving digital factories forward towards smart manufacturing: a survey, {eid: 85045842061, doi: 10.1007/s00170-018-2001-2}>, <Cyber-physical systems: A case study of development for manufacturing industry, {eid: 85028566642, doi: 10.1504/ijcat.2017.10006845}>, <The relation between systematic reviews and practice guidelines methods for developing guidelines: An overview, {eid: 0030761938, doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-127-3-199708010-00006}>, <Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling, {eid: 85067817812, doi: 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.05.045}>, <Part data integration in the shop floor digital twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.02.002}>, <An open source approach to the design and implementation of digital twins for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85064532610, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2019.1599436}>, <Meet Virtual Singapore, the city’s 3D digital twin, {eid: 85086996479}>, <Emergence of digital twins - is this the march of reason?, {eid: 85048741165, doi: 10.24840/2183-0606_005.003_0003}>, <Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance, {eid: 84869487494, doi: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037}>, <Digital twins probe into food cooling and biochemical quality changes for reducing losses in refrigerated supply chains, {eid: 85070210024, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.002}>, <Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites, {eid: 85052228223, doi: 10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.08.024}>, <BIOSOARM: A bio-inspired self-organising architecture for manufacturing cyber-physical shopfloors, {eid: 84986268581, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1258-2}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1566661}>, <Ergonomic rationalization of lighting in the working environment.

There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.","Digital Twin, Virtual

However, securely setting up OPC UA, the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate configuration for security-featuring protocols.","industrial communication, network security, security configuration",,,,,,,,"<Mission accomplished?

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.","cyber-physical systems, digital twins, information systems, model-driven software engineering, software architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85096954089}>, <None, {eid: 85085475406}>, <None,

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELS’17), IEEE, pp 281–291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.","Industry 4.0, Modeling languages, Smart

While adaptability is vastly increased, these more dynamic associations necessitate more extensive data sharing among different stakeholders while simultaneously overturning previously established levels of trust. Hence, manufacturers' demand to track goods and to investigate root causes of issues across their supply chains becomes more challenging to satisfy within these now untrusted environments. Complementarily, suppliers need to keep any data irrelevant to such routine checks secret to remain competitive. To bridge the needs of contractors and suppliers in increasingly flexible supply chains, we thus propose to establish a privacy-preserving and distributed multi-hop accountability log among the involved stakeholders based on Attribute-based Encryption and backed by a blockchain. Our large-scale feasibility study is motivated by a real-world manufacturing process, i.e., a fine blanking line, and reveals only modest costs for multi-hop tracing and tracking of goods.","Attribute-based encryption, Blockchain, Internet of Production, Multi-hop tracking and tracing, Supply chain",,,,,,,,"<The impact of supply chain integration on performance: A contingency and configuration approach, {eid: 71349087209}>, <Towards an infrastructure enabling the internet of production, {eid: 85075007871}>, <Dataflow challenges in an internet of production: A security & privacy perspective, {eid: 85075014511}>, <Security considerations for collaborations in an industrial iot-based lab of labs, {eid: 85083694152}>, <A journey in applying blockchain for cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85082175369}>, <The collaborative supply chain, {eid: 84992930161}>, <Information sharing as a coordination mechanism for reducing the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, {eid: 34247280386}>, <Building successful logistics partnerships, {eid: 0012566419}>, <Collaborative supply chain management: The most promising practice for building efficient and sustainable supply chains, {eid: 34249789030}>, <Digital supply chain transformation toward blockchain integration, {eid: 85061159764}>, <Blockchain in logistics and supply chain: Trick or treat?, {eid: 85044348960}>, <Do you need a blockchain?, {eid: 85058290284}>, <Productchain: Scalable blockchain framework to support provenance in supply chains, {eid: 85113258875}>, <Trustchain: Trust management in blockchain and iot supported supply chains, {eid: 85078703339}>, <Blockchain ready manufacturing supply chain using distributed ledger, {eid: 85028593103}>, <Toward an ontology-driven blockchain design for supply-chain provenance, {eid: 85044518392}>, <Blockchain-based supply chain traceability: Token recipes model manufacturing processes, {eid: 85067872571}>, <Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84857214669}>, <Decentralizing attribute-based encryption, {eid: 84864536476}>, <Cryptographic cloud storage, {eid: 84988890715}>, <Towards secure mobile cloud computing: A survey, {eid: 84866668858}>, <Easier: Encryption-based access control in social networks with efficient revocation, {eid: 84863649032}>, <Security and privacy in smart health: Efficient policy-hiding attribute-based access control, {eid: 85045344537}>, <Smart contract-based car insurance policies, {eid: 85076109663}>, <Adaptable key-policy attribute-based encryption with time interval, {eid: 84975129943}>, <Charm: A framework for rapidly prototyping cryptosystems, {eid: 84881234170}>, <None, {eid: 85090266623}>, <None, {eid: 85071622151}>, <None, {eid: 85075916236}>, <None, {eid: 85070610572}>, <A case for integrated data processing in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85108268408}>, <None, {eid: 2342639859}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,6/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85090159235

This paper aims to identify perspectives, principles and prospects of production logistics visibility (PLV). The study is based on a literature review of articles presenting definitions, development trends and the future role of PLV. It is concluded that visibility is generally defined by availability, quality, accessibility and usefulness of information. PLV could refer to the extent to which actors within the production systems have access to timely and accurate information considered useful to their operations. According to the findings, antecedents of PLV include digitalisation, IoT and connectivity. These steps are required to turn data into meaningful information that can be used for decision making in production and logistics setting to improve operational and business performance. Furthermore, to fully benefit from PLV, there has to be an integration of external and internal perspectives. Concluding, the paper defines future research efforts including four lines of exploration and development: (1) Intra-site visibility for material management including dynamic synchronisation, takt and resource planning. (2) Supply-oriented visibility for dynamic status and prediction of supply network status. These two initial lines of enquiry should include the perspectives of stakeholders, parameter, enabling technologies and potential impact. (3) A synthesised framework for Production Logistics Visibility, relying on utilizing antecedents and enabling multi-criteria decision in production logistics based on visibility, where performance in terms of efficiency, sustainability and flexibility is ensured. (4) To specifically detail and exploit the potential in production logistics visibility in the aspect of environmental sustainability and closed material and product loops.","Digitalization, Production logistics, Supply Chain, Visibility",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85182103068}>, <Digital supply chain transformation: Visualizing the possibilities, {eid: 85098647439}>, <Conducting a literature review, {eid: 84993029626}>, <None, {eid: 85182109660}>, <CIRP Nomenclature and Definitions for Manufacturing Systems (English Language Version), {eid: 0347367819}>, <Exploring internal and external supply chain linkages: Evidence from the field, {eid: 79955068420}>, <Leveraging supply chain visibility for responsiveness: The moderating role of internal integration, {eid: 84887009587}>, <Supply chain practice and information sharing, {eid: 34547682716}>, <Managing product quality risk and visibility in multi-layer supply chain, {eid: 84863186409}>, <Information-sharing in supply chains: Five proposals on how to proceed, {eid: 84986156114}>, <Defining and assessing requisite supply chain visibility in regulated industries, {eid: 84877825051}>, <An empirical investigation of supply chain strategy typologies and relationships to performance, {eid: 51749125229}>, <Information visibility non differentiated products, {eid: 0036489962}>, <Improving supply chain performance through improved visibility, {eid: 84986105967}>, <Performance measurement in a supply chain, {eid: 0038046206}>, <The effect of controversial global sourcing practices on ethical judgements and intentions of US consumers, {eid: 84939944218}>, <The value of sharing planning information in supply chains, {eid: 84878249883}>, <Antecedents of supply chain visibility in retail supply chains: A resource-based theory perspective, {eid: 34548713468}>, <None, {eid: 84982208424}>, <Improving supply chain visibility using iot-internet of things, {eid: 85063897267}>, <A Hybrid Blockchain Ledger for Supply Chain Visibility, {eid: 85053935830}>, <None, {eid: 85063867101}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility and supply chain performance, {eid: 84897115235}>, <Interorganizational information systems visibility in buyer-supplier relationshps: The case of telecommunication equipment component manufacturing industry, {eid: 79953161073}>, <Supply chain visibility: A decision making perspective, {eid: 70349320049}>, <The benefits of supply chain visibility: A value assessment model, {eid: 84896361906}>, <An investigation of visibility and flexibility as complements to supply chain analytics: An organizational information processing theory perspective, {eid: 85026783047}>, <Characterizing supply chain visibility-A literature review, {eid: 85042486901}>, <Does supply chain visibility affect operating performance?-Evidence from conflict minerals disclosures, {eid: 85064002720}>, <Sustainability-related supply chain risks: Conceptualization and management, {eid: 84896395922}>, <Extending the supply chain visibility boundry, Utilizing stakeholders for identifying supply chain sustainability risks, {eid: 85009446793}>, <Role-Tailored map dashboards-A new approach for enhancing the forest-based supply chain, {eid: 85061348901}>, <None, {eid: 85084767126}>",,,IOS Press BV,,,10/7/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85098635883

Our design provides a notion of secure end-to-end sensing of interactions even when originating from untrusted surroundings. Due to attested checkpointing, we can identify misinformation early on and reliably pinpoint the origin. A blockchain enables long-term verifiability for all (now trustworthy) IoT data within our system even if issues are detected only after the fact.

Such hospitals look to improve operational efficiency and productivity to be able to treat more patients without increasing cost and justify the capital investment. Put simply, the hospital staff will in future co-work and collaborate with robotic technologies in a shared workspace to deliver the same level of patient care if not better. For this to happen, there is a need to appreciate how the current human effort can be integrated seamlessly with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) activities in a hospital setting and to visually show to the operations/logistics personnel the attendant challenges/ bottlenecks. We study a Greenfield hospital in Singapore and provide a digital twin of its future operations with RPA solutions. Specifically, we design an efficient logistics system (central sterile services, materials management, food, pharmacy, linen), develop robust RPA solutions, and minimize the disruptions from automation introduction. The transportation system within the hospital, dispatching rule of the lifts and robots, are optimized through extensive simulation.","Digital twinning, Hospitals, Logistics, Simulation, Singapore",,,,,,,,"<""On the concept of health capital and the demand for health"", {eid: 0000252351}>, <""Managing health care organizations: where professionalism meets complexity science"", {eid: 0033995008}>, <6 big benefits of applying automation to healthcare, {eid: 85081401696}>, <""Robotics in Logistics: A DPDHL Perspective on Implications and Use Cases for the Logistics Industry"", {eid: 85063581690}>, <Population Health Management: A Roadmap for Provider-Based Automation in a New Era of Healthcare, {eid: 85081359339}>, <""Patient flow modelling and performance analysis of healthcare delivery processes in hospitals: A review and reflections"", {eid: 84912522613}>, <""A formal approach to workflow analysis"", {eid: 0034384404}>, <""On fair routing from emergency departments to hospital wards: QED queues with heterogeneous servers"", {eid: 84864074121}>, <""Digital twin-driven product design framework"", {eid: 85061021953}>",,,International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics Research,,,2/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85081348883

Digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. Although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. The main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technologies in healthcare. After providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.","Agents, Digital twin, Healthcare, MAS, Trauma management",,,,,,,,"<On behalf of the Swedish digital twin consortium: digital twins to personalize medicine, {eid: 85077448104, doi: 10.1186/s13073-019-0701-3}>, <Multi-agent oriented programming with jacamo, {eid: 84875735836, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2011.10.004}>, <Digital twin—the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <A personal medical digital assistant agent for supporting human operators in emergency scenarios, {eid: 85036626515}>, <Bdi personal medical assistant agents: the case of trauma tracking and alerting, {eid: 85058662276, doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2018.12.002}>, <None, {eid: 0004197808}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A novel cloud-based framework for the elderly healthcare services using digital twin, {eid: 85065103886, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909828}>, <Synthetic ppg generation from haemodynamic model with baroreflex autoregulation: A digital twin of cardiovascular system, {eid: 85077890925}>, <Pervasive tracking for time-dependent acute patient flow: A case study in trauma management, {eid: 85070984457}>, <Real-time tracking and documentation in trauma management, {eid: 85061744374}>, <Agent-based modeling for the self-management of chronic diseases: an exploratory study, {eid: 85027678799, doi: 10.1177/0037549717712605}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <None, {eid: 85088935302}>, <Artifacts in the A&A meta-model for multi-agent systems, {eid: 52949149709}>, <Augmented societies with mirror worlds, {eid: 85039554084, doi: 10.1007/s00146-017-0788-2}>, <Mirror worlds as agent societies situated in mixed reality environments, {eid: 84951094941}>, <None, {eid: 84962306691}>, <Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <The digital twin: realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2016.11.152}>, <None, {eid: 85079052784}>",,,Springer,,,9/1/2020,,,,,,32748066,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85088988374

A key enabler for the advances promised by CPPSs is the concept of a digital twin, which is the virtual representation of a real-world entity, or the physical twin. An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations. This architecture provides a service-based and real-time enabled infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration. To evaluate the architecture, it was implemented for a small, but typical, physical manufacturing system component.","Cyber physical systems (CPS), Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Internet of things (IoT), OPC, Tecnomatix",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85006080283}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <None, {eid: 84991364515}>, <Embedded digital twin for ARTI-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Analysis of OPC UA performances, {eid: 84884500285, doi: 10.1016/j.csi.2013.06.004}>, <Performance evaluation of OPC UA, {eid: 78650534914}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <None, {eid: 85087000373}>, <None, {eid: 85059093528}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85059079453}>, <None, {eid: 85086998540}>, <None, {eid: 85059077132}>, <None, {eid: 84899127785}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models, {eid: 84928667408, doi: 10.3390/s150304837}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}>, <None, {eid: 79957551757}>, <Industrial automation based on cyber-physical systems technologies: Prototype implementations and challenges, {eid: 84941662063, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2015.08.004}>, <Review on cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85010065711, doi: 10.1109/JAS.2017.7510349}>, <None, {eid: 85086992184}>, <None, {eid: 85086984554}>, <None, {eid: 85056624416}>, <None, {eid: 85059098452}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.06.005}>, <Cyber physical process monitoring systems, {eid: 84949993153, doi: 10.1007/s10845-015-1180-z}>, <Round-trip delay estimation in OPC UA ServerClient communication channel, {eid: 85009776803, doi: 10.5755/j01.eie.22.6.17229}>, <None, {eid: 85076280430}>, <None, {eid: 85086991713}>, <None, {eid: 85053398467}>, <Literature review of Industry 4.0 and related technologies, {eid: 85078567359}>, <Documentation and records: Harmonized GMP requirements, {eid: 80052228922, doi: 10.4103/0975-1483.80303}>, <None, {eid: 85086985933}>, <Integrating the digital twin of a shop floor conveyor in the manufacturing control system, {eid: 85070650523}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Cybersecurity Considerations for Industrie 4.0, {eid: 85070638283}>, <A six-layer architecture for digital twins with aggregation, {eid: 85070603892, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-27477-1_13}>, <A Centralized Support Infrastructure (CSI) to Manage CPS Digital Twin, towards the Synchronization between CPS Deployed on the Shopfloor and Their Digital Representation, {eid: 85076290432}>, <Multi-agent system architectures for collaborative prognostics, {eid: 85068194472, doi: 10.1007/s10845-019-01478-9}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.040}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <None, {eid: 84885413599}>, <None, {eid: 85086988006}>, <None, {eid: 85097986136}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Digital twins and cyber–physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049, doi: 10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>",,,Springer,,,8/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85076271545

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.","artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, Digital twin, hybrid analysis and modeling, machine learning",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85028076136}>, <None, {eid: 85081081436}>, <None, {eid: 85081090716}>, <Experimentable digital twins Streamlining simulation-based systems engineering for industry 4.0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <None, {eid: 85081092982}>, <Actigraphy as an objective intra-individual marker of activity patterns in acute-phase bipolar disorder: A case series, {eid: 85056238980}>, <Computer modelling to personalize bioengineered heart valves, {eid: 85047357324}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control over mobile networks: Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Advances in organon-A-chip engineering, {eid: 85051246777}>, <Organoid-on-A-chip and body-on-A-chip systems for drug screening and disease modeling, {eid: 84981734428}>, <None, {eid: 85081092828}>, <Health care in the cyberspace: Medical cyber-physical system and digital twin challenges, {eid: 85081088828}>, <Challenges and research directions in medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155167716}>, <Medical cyber-physical systems: A survey, {eid: 85043473992}>, <Emerging security mechanisms for medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84976524779}>, <A survey on wireless body area networks, {eid: 79951723271}>, <US economic sensitivity to weather variability, {eid: 79961049711}>, <The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction, {eid: 84940937976}>, <Urban finescale forecasting reveals weather conditions with unprecedented detail, {eid: 85029851316}>, <Using smartphones for monitoring atmospheric tides, {eid: 85046743732}>, <Private observations improve MET Norways operational weather forecasts, {eid: 85081078971}>, <A hybrid ETKF 3DVAR data assimilation scheme for the WRF model.

This framework helps operation teams solve the problem of insufficient informatization and automatic management ability of green building maintenance. Besides, the structure of DT-GBMS is designed in detail according to practical usage.

To acquire the service information of each general part under the environment of high temperature and serious oil pollution for predicting remaining life and preventative maintenance, a digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability system for general parts in continuous casting machine is proposed. First, the systematic architecture of proposed approach is given in detail, where a typical five-layer model for digital twin-driven monitoring and traceability is established. Second, the Web-based 3D visualization monitoring for continuous casting machine is achieved by using lightweight 3D twin model. After that, an assembly model based on polychromatic sets is built for expressing and describing the assembly relationships and assembly process of general parts. Meanwhile, an encoding rule for part and position is put forward by considering assembly position information. On the basis of that, the general parts with total process information are traced in the service life cycle. Finally, digital twin-based 3D visualization monitoring and traceability prototype system is developed and implemented, where the experiment cases verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.","3D twin model, 3D visualization monitoring, Digital twin, Polychromatic sets, Traceability",,,,,,,,"<Towards a Cost-Effective and Reusable Traceability System.

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,12/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099750826

In the domain of industrial energy systems, they are applied to facilitate a flexible and optimized operation. With the help of Digital Twins, the industry can participate even stronger in the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current Digital Twin implementations are often application-specific solutions without general architectural concepts and their structures and namings differ, although the basic concepts are quite similar. For this reason, we analyzed concepts, architectures, and frameworks for Digital Twins in the literature to develop a technology-independent Generic Digital Twin Architecture (GDTA), which is aligned with the information technology layers of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0). This alignment facilitates a common naming and understanding of the proposed architectural structure.

Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert' judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value determining method by accurate expert scoring.","Analytic hierarchy process, Complex networks, Digital twin, Evidence theory, Fuzzy number, Intelligent manufacturing, PROMETHEE II, Sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Report of the world commission on environment and development, {eid: 58149372152}>, <Perspectives of environmental education and environmental management in Bangladesh and their sustainability, {eid: 85102763751}>, <Coordinates of the accounting in Romania.

Engineering and monitoring interactive digital twins currently demands integrating different piecemeal technologies that effectively hinders their application and deployment. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived. We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing.","Digital Twins, Information systems, Model-driven software engineering, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <Model-based generation of enterprise information systems, {eid: 85048362638}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A multi agent system architecture to implement collaborative learning for social industrial assets, {eid: 85052888258}>, <None, {eid: 85086228557}>, <Systematic language extension mechanisms for the MontiArc architecture description language, {eid: 85025126026}>, <Architectural programming with MontiArcAutomaton, {eid: 85058218229}>, <A distributed ledger approach to digital twin secure data sharing, {eid: 85069511065}>, <None, {eid: 85065215650}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Continuous transition from model-driven prototype to full-size real-world enterprise information systems, {eid: 85096970269}>, <None, {eid: 85069873204}>, <Automatic synthesis from UML/ MARTE models using channel semantics, {eid: 84874155522}>, <Digital twins as a modern approach to design of industrial processes, {eid: 85064730379}>, <None, {eid: 0003712808}>, <Visualising the digital twin using web services and augmented reality, {eid: 85012932205}>, <A domain model-driven approach for producing user interfaces to multi-platform information systems, {eid: 84876552310}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <None, {eid: 85097405814}>, <None, {eid: 33748331276}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart shop-floor, {eid: 85056967567}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,11/3/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85097375593

DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.

In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms to learn, reason, and build the 'digital twin' of a patient. Computational models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and enabling the vision of precision medicine.","Artificial intelligence, Computational modelling, Digital twin, Precision medicine",,,,,,,,"<Precision medicine in cardiology, {eid: 84976448008}>, <From genetics to smart watches: developments in precision cardiology, {eid: 85058940139}>, <A new initiative on precision medicine, {eid: 84923762812}>, <Promises, promises, and precision medicine, {eid: 85062423215}>, <Precision medicine vs preventive medicine, {eid: 85060593774}>, <Evolution beyond neo-Darwinism: a new conceptual framework, {eid: 84924264935}>, <Integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling-perspectives, challenges, and opportunities in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences, {eid: 85135599036}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Teaching cardiovascular medicine to machines, {eid: 85050918165}>, <Length-dependent tension in the failing heart and the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 78751507006}>, <Differentiating electromechanical from non-electrical substrates of mechanical discoordination to identify responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 84955475978}>, <SMOD - Data Augmentation Based on Statistical Models of Deformation to Enhance Segmentation in 2D Cine Cardiac MRI, {eid: 85067176547, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-21949-9-39}>, <Machine-learning integration of complex echocardiographic patterns and clinical parameters from cohorts and trials, {eid: 85092288720, doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz745.0147}>, <Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?, {eid: 85047537837}>, <Big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care: promise and challenges, {eid: 84961393205}>, <Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular imaging: JACC state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85062806342}>, <Computational models in cardiology, {eid: 85055544890}>, <Enabling precision cardiology through multiscale biology and systems medicine, {eid: 85033597806}>, <Recent developments in using mechanistic cardiac modelling for drug safety evaluation, {eid: 84959289711}>, <None, {eid: 0004110543}>, <Computational modelling of 1D blood flow with variable mechanical properties and its application to the simulation of wave propagation in the human arterial system, {eid: 0242497983}>, <Random forest for automatic assessment of heart failure severity in a telemonitoring scenario, {eid: 84886524376}>, <Gaussian process robust regression for noisy heart rate data, {eid: 50049125217}>, <Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics, {eid: 85048201970}>, <Patient-specific computer modeling to predict aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, {eid: 84959872264}>, <Patient-specific cardiovascular computational modeling: diversity of personalization and challenges, {eid: 85049612985}>, <The role of computational modeling and simulation in the total product life cycle of peripheral vascular devices, {eid: 85018379109}>, <Multi-modality image-based computational analysis of haemodynamics in aortic dissection, {eid: 84944603147}>, <""Virtual"" (computed) fractional flow reserve, {eid: 84937739100}>, <The estimation of patient-specific cardiac diastolic functions from clinical measurements, {eid: 84883865079}>, <Left ventricular diastolic myocardial stiffness and end-diastolic myofibre stress in human heart failure using personalised biomechanical analysis, {eid: 85049665722}>, <A finite-element approach to the direct computation of relative cardiovascular pressure from time-resolved MR velocity data, {eid: 84861976269}>, <Non-invasive pressure difference estimation from PC-MRI using the work-energy equation, {eid: 84942257432}>, <Beyond Bernoulli: improving the accuracy and precision of non-invasive estimation of peak pressure drops, {eid: 85009860323}>, <Diagnostic performance of noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography in suspected coronary artery disease, {eid: 84896972430}>, <Noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CT angiography, {eid: 84944041048}>, <Non-invasive fractional flow reserve using computed tomographic angiography: where are we now and where are we going?, {eid: 85024487439}>, <Advancing regulatory science with computational modeling for medical devices at the FDAs Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories, {eid: 85062702939, doi: 10.3389/fmed.2018.00241}>, <Noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms: a feasibility report noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms.

In contrast to software products running on PCs or smartphones, updating and maintaining cyber–physical systems presents a major challenge. This challenge, combined with the often decades-long lifetime of cyber–physical systems, and with their deployment in often safety-critical contexts, makes it particularly important to consider their security already at design time. When aiming to obtain a provably secure design, model-driven security approaches are key, as they allow to identify and mitigate threats in early phases of the development. As attacks may exploit both code-level as well as physical vulnerabilities, such approaches must consider not just the cyber layer but the physical layer as well. To find out which model-driven security approaches for cyber–physical systems exist considering both layers, we conducted a systematic literature review. From a set of 1160 initial papers, we extracted 69 relevant publications describing 17 candidate approaches. We found seven approaches specifically developed for cyber–physical systems. We provide a comprehensive description of these approaches, discuss them in particular detail, and determine their limitations. We found out that model-driven security is a relevant research area but most approaches focus only on specific security properties and even for CPS-specific approaches the platform is only rarely taken into account.","Cyber–physical systems, Literature survey, Model-driven security, Platform-specific, Security modeling, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<Design methodologies for securing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84963735979}>, <None, {eid: 84981484936}>, <None, {eid: 85086707753}>, <Towards the model-driven engineering of secure yet safe embedded systems, {eid: 84938678794}>, <None, {eid: 85007566152}>, <DREMS ML: A wide spectrum architecture design language for distributed computing platforms, {eid: 84930180339}>, <Ensuring safety, security, and sustainability of mission-critical cyber–physical systems, {eid: 84155165352}>, <None, {eid: 33750960661}>, <A tutorial on uppaal, {eid: 35048862279}>, <Secure Computer Systems: Mathematical Foundations: Technical Report, {eid: 0003400251}>, <Integrity Considerations for Secure Computer Systems: Technical Report, {eid: 0003400255}>, <Towards verified synthesis of ProCom, a component model for real-time embedded systems, {eid: 79960534876}>, <Pride-an environment for component-based development of distributed real-time embedded systems, {eid: 84902154783}>, <Model-driven software engineering in practice, {eid: 84878326137}>, <ProCom – The Progress Component Model Reference Manual, {eid: 70350650120}>, <Functional modeling compiler for system-level design of automotive cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84936887971}>, <Addressing software security in the federal acquisition process, {eid: 84995800777}>, <On the security of public key protocols, {eid: 0020720357}>, <Analysis for security attacks in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85086074073}>, <None, {eid: 34250158136}>, <Taming heterogeneity - the Ptolemy approach, {eid: 0242444222}>, <The EVITA project webpage, {eid: 85086705424}>, <Model-based security testing: a taxonomy and systematic classification, {eid: 84958867836}>, <From embedded to cyber-physical systems: Challenges and future directions, {eid: 84956559487}>, <Replication package for the literature review, {eid: 85086709257, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3843478}>, <A tool-supported method for the design and implementation of secure distributed applications, {eid: 79551530717}>, <SECTET: an extensible framework for the realization of secure inter-organizational workflows, {eid: 33750453781}>, <CoCoME - the common component modeling example, {eid: 54249117804}>, <An ontology of information security, {eid: 85001799494}>, <A Requirement Engineering Driven Approach to Security Architecture Design for Distributed Embedded Systems, {eid: 84938694373}>, <None, {eid: 85086733219}>, <None, {eid: 0024663847}>, <Security in model driven development: A survey, {eid: 80455173460}>, <Secure Systems Development with UML, {eid: 84891477511}>, <None, {eid: 84949203155}>, <Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews, Vol. 33, No. TR/SE-0401, {eid: 27644567603}>, <Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, Vol. 2: Technical Report, {eid: 44649122227}>, <A survey of approaches combining safety and security for industrial control systems, {eid: 84961342778}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <German steel mill cyber attack, {eid: 84979967732}>, <DREMS: A model-driven distributed secure information architecture platform for managed embedded systems, {eid: 84897082425}>, <Safe and Secure Model-Driven Design for Embedded Systems, {eid: 85078197691}>, <None, {eid: 85043324734}>, <Security modeling for embedded system design, {eid: 85043346656}>, <SysML models and model transformation for security, {eid: 84970045832}>, <Cyber-physical systems security: a systematic mapping study, {eid: 85023636879}>, <A general theory of composition for a class of “possibilistic” properties, {eid: 0002426876}>, <Mendeley desktop, {eid: 85086720665}>, <None, {eid: 70349673753}>, <Engineering Secure Software Architectures: Patterns, Models and Analysis, {eid: 85086733779}>, <None, {eid: 84887684517}>, <Domain specific and model based systems engineering in the smart grid as prerequesite for security by design, {eid: 84973889966}>, <Model-based security engineering for cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85006307160}>, <An extensive systematic review on the Model-Driven Development of secure systems, {eid: 84942611940}>, <A UML Profile for MARTE: Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems (2008-06-08), Vol. 2: Technical Report ptc/2008-06-09, {eid: 85086718756}>, <System Design, Modeling, and Simulation.

To this end, several attack modelling techniques can be employed, the attack graph being the most prevalent among them. Unfortunately, the discovery and analysis of all possible attack paths in an attack graph is not possible in systems even of a moderate size. In this work we propose a novel systematic method for discovering and analyzing attack paths in real-world scale interconnected Cyber Physical Systems. The method considers the criticality of each sub-system in discovering paths and the risk to the overall system that each path presents to analyze and prioritize paths. We illustrate the workings of the method by applying to the navigational Cyber Physical Systems of the Cyber-Enabled Ship to identify and analyze highly critical attack paths originating from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and targeting the Autonomous Navigation System (ANS).","Attack path analysis, Autonomous ships, Cyber physical systems, Navigational system",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-security incidents: A review cases in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85049515128}>, <None, {eid: 85082400346}>, <Shipping 4.0 and training seafarers for the future autonomous and unmanned ships, {eid: 85098252363}>, <Evaluating cybersecurity risks in the maritime industry: A literature review, {eid: 85098259890}>, <None, {eid: 85086449047}>, <Cyber security issues in navigation systems of marine vessels from a control perspective, {eid: 85032224560}>, <None, {eid: 85061375749}>, <A survey of attack models for cyber-physical security assessment in electricity grid, {eid: 85076807960}>, <A review of attack graph and attack tree visual syntax in cyber security, {eid: 85083098928}>, <Cyber-attack modeling analysis techniques: An overview, {eid: 85009788830}>, <None, {eid: 84920885575}>, <Evaluating network security with two-layer attack graphs, {eid: 77950788192}>, <A scalable approach to attack graph generation, {eid: 34547239511}>, <Automated generation and analysis of attack graphs, {eid: 44049089202}>, <None, {eid: 85098250142}>, <None, {eid: 4243503824}>, <None, {eid: 85098248781}>, <A graph-based system for network-vulnerability analysis, {eid: 84988504967}>, <Finding optimal attack path using attack graphs: A survey, {eid: 84865284443}>, <Quantitative security risk assessment of enterprise networks, {eid: 85099430113}>, <Computer-attack graph generation tool, {eid: 84964504906}>, <MulVAL: A logic-based network security analyzer, {eid: 85076884574}>, <Topological analysis of network attack vulnerability, {eid: 20444498659}>, <Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis, {eid: 0038687692}>, <Survey of attack graph analysis methods from the perspective of data and knowledge processing, {eid: 85077756860}>, <None, {eid: 58749097495}>, <Practical attack graph generation for network defense, {eid: 39049104457}>, <Distributed attack graph generation, {eid: 84987619351}>, <K maximum probability attack paths dynamic generation algorithm, {eid: 84977568617}>, <Dynamic security risk management using Bayesian attack graphs, {eid: 81455142742}>, <Scalable attack graph for risk assessment, {eid: 83755177309}>, <Exploring risk flow attack graph for security risk assessment, {eid: 84944080112}>, <Finding dependencies between cyber-physical domains for security testing of industrial control systems, {eid: 85060062319}>, <Cyber-attack path discovery in a dynamic supply chain maritime risk management system, {eid: 85029482846}>, <A security analysis method for industrial internet of things, {eid: 85046349771}>, <Attack graph implementation and visualization for cyber physical systems, {eid: 85079057706}>, <Safety related cyber-attacks identification and assessment for autonomous inland ships, {eid: 85079890165}>, <Identifying critical components in large scale cyber physical systems, {eid: 85093114845}>, <None, {eid: 84943192699}>, <None, {eid: 85098252952}>, <A practical approach to stakeholder-driven determination of security requirements based on the GDPR and common criteria, {eid: 85083037726}>, <None, {eid: 85098246820}>, <None, {eid: 0347227352}>, <Shipping 4.0: Security requirements for the cyber-enabled ship, {eid: 85079907992}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85098235746

The required levels of autonomy, openness, and self-adaptation, as well as the dynamic nature of the context of such CPS, result in challenging tasks for their engineering. During operation, unexpected situations in which the system has insufficient knowledge about the current state of the system itself as well as its context may occur. Engineering CPS, e.g., for industrial production sites, must account for such uncertainties the system will have to cope with during its lifetime in a structured and systematic way. Since the development of CPS requires consideration of different system perspectives, current uncertainty modeling approaches cannot be applied right away, as they do not explicitly consider uncertainty aspects that affect different artifacts. To aid the engineering of CPS, this article presents a model-based approach to document uncertainty. We propose 'Orthogonal Uncertainty Models,' which closely integrate with other engineering artifacts from different perspectives, as a means for capturing a dedicated uncertainty viewpoint. Our approach has been evaluated in the industry automation domain. The application shows that the idea of regarding uncertainty within a dedicated perspective is highly beneficial. Particularly, our approach helps to uncover and document uncertainties related to behavioral, functional, and structural properties of a system, as well as uncertainties related to business models that would otherwise possibly remain covert. Note to Practitioners-Identifying and documenting uncertainties, which may occur during operation of a system, is a common problem in engineering processes. Such uncertainties may lead to severe damage, and thus need to be mitigated appropriately. It is crucial to account for these uncertainties during engineering, especially in the early phases. Depending on the specific project characteristics, a multitude of different diagram types are used to model a system. Uncertainties thus reflect in many artifacts, which leads to: 1) redundancies in the specified uncertainty attached to diagram elements and 2) uncertainty information (e.g., about the cause or effect of uncertainty) that is spread across different diagrams. The latter makes it difficult to structure uncertainty information and trace it throughout the engineering process so that uncertainty can be systematically considered. Our approach provides a graphical modeling language that employs a dedicated perspective on uncertainty in separate diagrams that can be linked to any engineering artifact.","Cyber-physical systems, industry automation case study, model-based engineering, orthogonal modeling, uncertainty, uncertainty modeling",,,,,,,,"<Let us work together-task planning of multiple mobile robots, {eid: 0030408703}>, <Smart factory of industry 4.0: Key technologies, application case, and challenges, {eid: 85038869974}>, <A taxonomy of uncertainty for dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 84865127075}>, <Cyber-physical systems challenges: A needs analysis for collaborating embedded software systems, {eid: 85013764660}>, <Software engineering for self-adaptive systems: A second research roadmap, {eid: 84879852118}>, <Model-based documentation of context uncertainty for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85059975857}>, <On the use of orthogonal context uncertainty models in the engineering of collaborative embedded systems, {eid: 85044366725}>, <Fostering concurrent engineering of cyber-physical systems a proposal for an ontological context framework, {eid: 84980395713}>, <The 4+1 View Model of architecture, {eid: 0029408391}>, <Requirements engineering metamodel: An integrated view of requirements, {eid: 80655137959}>, <Research directions in requirements engineering, {eid: 34748841665}>, <Spes xt context modeling framework, {eid: 85030241532}>, <Autonomous indoor exploration via polygon map construction and graph-based slam using directional endpoint features, {eid: 85058665882}>, <Obstacle persistent adaptive map maintenance for autonomous mobile robots using spatio-temporal reasoning, {eid: 85072983958}>, <Optimized multiagent routing for a class of guidepath-based transport systems, {eid: 85042109689}>, <Autonomous robotic exploration by incremental road map construction, {eid: 85076803387}>, <Cooperative transport by multiple mobile robots in unknown static environments associated with real-time task assignment, {eid: 0036817712}>, <A survey of inter-vehicle communication protocols and their applications, {eid: 67650790153}>, <A meta-model for representing variability in product family development, {eid: 27644561199}>, <Variability management in software product lines: A systematic review, {eid: 77954470596}>, <Variability management in software product line engineering, {eid: 34247141998}>, <Bridging metamodels and ontologies in software engineering, {eid: 78650609681}>, <Understanding uncertainty in cyber-physical systems: A conceptual model, {eid: 84977479326}>, <Uncertainty-wise cyber-physical system test modeling, {eid: 85025841433}>, <Hazard relation diagrams: A diagrammatic representation to increase validation objectivity of requirements-based hazard mitigations, {eid: 85018728153}>, <A goal-based modeling approach to develop requirements of an adaptive system with environmental uncertainty, {eid: 77249105104}>, <Understanding the scope of uncertainty in dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 77955449058}>, <Elements underlying the specification of requirements, {eid: 0031506469}>, <Requirements Viewpoint, {eid: 84908254104}>, <A sensor failure detection framework for autonomous mobile robots, {eid: 0031387831}>, <The basic principles of uncertain information fusion.

A Review of Hybrid Physics Guided Machine Learning Techniques with Cyber-Physical System (CPS) Focus,2020,IEEE Access,,,,,,,172,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987324,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987324,"<Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Manufacturing and Design Lab (MADLab), University at Buffalo>",,"© 2013 IEEE.A multitude of cyber-physical system (CPS) applications, including design, control, diagnosis, prognostics, and a host of other problems, are predicated on the assumption of model availability. There are mainly two approaches to modeling: Physics/Equation based modeling (Model-Based, MB) and Machine Learning (ML). Recently, there is a growing consensus that ML methodologies relying on data need to be coupled with prior scientific knowledge (or physics, MB) for modeling CPS. We refer to the paradigm that combines MB approaches with ML as hybrid learning methods. Hybrid modeling (HB) methods is a growing field within both the ML and scientific communities, and are recognized as an important emerging but nascent area of research. Recently, several works have attempted to merge MB and ML models for the complete exploitation of their combined potential. However, the research literature is scattered and unorganized. So, we make a meticulous and systematic attempt at organizing and standardizing the methods of combining ML and MB models. In addition to that, we outline five metrics for the comprehensive evaluation of hybrid models. Finally, we conclude by shedding some light on the challenges of hybrid models, which we, as a research community, should focus on for harnessing the full potential of hybrid models. An additional feature of this survey is that the hybrid modeling work has been discussed with a focus on modeling cyber-physical systems.","Cyber-physical systems, deep learning, deep neural networks,

One of these methodologies is set-based design (SBD), a concurrent design methodology well suited for complex systems subject to significant uncertainty. Since the 1990s, numerous private, public, and defense sector design programs have successfully implemented SBD. However, concerns regarding SBD's complexity, tendency toward qualitative methods, and lack of quantitative tools have limited its use. To address these issues, our research surveys 122 refereed journal articles and conference papers to assess SBD's state-of-practice and identify relevant research opportunities. To accomplish these tasks, we perform a structured literature review to identify and assess relevant and influential research. We found that SBD's state-of-practice relies heavily upon decision and tradespace analysis with increasing emphasis on uncertainty modeling and MBSE. We found that the majority of SBD research consists of quantitative methodologies focusing on component and small system applications. We also found that complex system applications used mostly qualitative methodologies. We identify SBD research opportunities for requirements development, MBSE, uncertainty modeling, multiresolution modeling, adversarial analysis, and program management. Finally, we recommend the development of a comprehensive SBD methodology and toolkit, suited for complex system design across all stages of the product development life cycle.","literature survey,

Manufacturing systems simulation has proven to be a powerful tool for designing and evaluating a manufacturing system due to its low cost, quick analysis, low risk and meaningful insight that it may provide, improving thus the understanding of the influence of each component. Simulation comprises an indispensable set of IT tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing. It allows experimentation and validation of product, process, and system design and configuration. This paper investigates the major historical milestones in the evolution of manufacturing systems simulation technologies and examines recent industrial and research approaches in key fields of manufacturing. It describes how the urge towards digitalisation of manufacturing in the context of the 4th Industrial revolution has shaped simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems and reviews the new approaches that have arisen in the literature. Particular focus is given to technologies in the digitalised factories of the future that are gaining ground in industrial applications simulation, offering multiple advantages.","digitalised manufacturing, information and communication technologies, manufacturing systems, review, simulation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85068586021}>, <None, {eid: 85068557679}>, <Modelling and Simulation of Manufacturing Process Chains, {eid: 84871691411}>, <Multidimensional Evaluation of the Changeability of Interlinked Production Processes with Material Flow Simulation, {eid: 84883895135}>, <ErgoToolkit: An Ergonomic Analysis Tool in a Virtual Manufacturing Environment, {eid: 84878686417}>, <Recent Advances in Augmented Reality, {eid: 0035503402}>, <None, {eid: 85068569873}>, <Developing and Applying AR Technology in Design, Production, Service and Training, {eid: 28244442026}>, <Hybrid Simulation for Complex Manufacturing Value-chain Environments, {eid: 85029845588}>, <Virtual Engineering of a Fusion Reactor: Application to Divertor Design, Manufacture, and Testing, {eid: 85052632583}>, <A roadmap for parametric CAD efficiency in the automotive industry, {eid: 84879198567}>, <Explicit Reference Modelling Methodology in Parametric CAD System, {eid: 84887995562}>, <Digital Twin—The Simulation Aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <None, {eid: 0004305643}>, <Advances in Modelling and Simulation of Grinding Processes, {eid: 72949124419}>, <Possibilities and Challenges for Proactive Manufacturing Ergonomics, {eid: 85052059498}>, <Asymptotically Stable Walking of a Five-link Underactuated 3-D Bipedal Robot, {eid: 60549118116}>, <MES Architecture for FMS Compatible to ERP, {eid: 0036574303}>, <None, {eid: 0004210859}>, <Verification of Human Factors in Manufacturing Process Design.

Simulations are frequently used to increase this type of efficiency through diagnosis and evaluation of a physical asset. In particular, digital twin (DT) is currently attracting considerable attention as it provides technical functionality at the type and instance stages of a work center. In addition, DT can support efficient control and decision making with less gap in the site through vertical integration and horizontal coordination. Moreover, DT can contribute to prevent energy-related inefficiency by providing the functionalities required for the service composition of the technical functionalities that are defined for the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency. However, in terms of the provision of service-composition-based technical functionality of DT, no research has defined each step of the operation procedures of work-center-level DT application at a detailed level. This study proposes detailed operation procedures to create, synchronize, and utilize a work-center-level DT to provide appropriate service-composition-based technical functionality. To this end, the technical requirements were derived from the analysis of the service-composition-based technical functionality. This study systematically defined the various service-composition-based technical functionalities through a combination of various types of operation procedures. Each type is defined for three steps, namely creation, synchronization, and utilization. In addition, a case study was conducted to clarify DT and provide a suitable definition for the requirements.","Asset administration shell, Digital twin, Process and systematic efficiency enhancement,

The cooperation and coordination of smart things are a promising strategy for satisfying requirements that are beyond the capacity of a single smart thing. One of the major challenges for today's software engineering is the management of large and complex computing systems characterized by a high degree of physical distribution. Examples of such systems arise in many application domains. The number of connected devices grows from billions to hundreds of billions, so a maximum of automatisms must be integrated in IoT architectures in order to control and manage them. Software architects migrate to service oriented architecture and applications are now being constructed as service compositions. Since each IoT device includes one or more microservices, the increasing number of devices around the user makes them difficult to assemble in order to achieve a common goal. In this paper, we propose a self-assembling solution based on self-controlled service components taking into account non-functional requirements concerning the offered quality of services and the structuration of the resulting assembly. Its aim is to build and maintain an assembly of services (taking into account arrival of new peers or failure of existing ones) that, besides functional requirements, also fulfills global quality-of-service and structural requirements.","Internet of Things, Quality of service, Self-assembly, Service component, Service composition, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<User-assisted semantic interoperability in Internet of Things: visuallyfacilitated ontology alignment through visually-enriched ontology and thing descriptions, {eid: 84881423990}>, <IBM cloud, {eid: 85084938014}>, <Amazon web services, {eid: 85081548120}>, <Microsoft azure, {eid: 85081561000}>, <Adaptive video transmission control system based on reinforcement learning approach over heterogeneous networks, {eid: 85027958784, doi: 10.1109/TASE.2014.2387212}>, <Energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation for delay-constrained video over heterogeneous wireless networks, {eid: 85009971384, doi: 10.1109/JSAC.2016.2632599}>, <Constructing distributed time-critical applications using cognitive enabled services, {eid: 85065664842, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.010}>, <SWITCH workbench: A novel approach for the development and deployment of time-critical microservice-based cloud-native applications, {eid: 85064939462, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.04.008}>, <An overview of cloud middleware services for interconnection of healthcare platforms, {eid: 84907342232, doi: 10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866753}>, <None, {eid: 85084940100}>, <Autonomic Computing: Principles, Design and Implementation, {eid: 84890106421}>, <Internet of smart things -

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have affected several research fields, leading to improvements that could not have been possible with conventional optimization techniques. Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human–machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.","Anomaly detection, Fault detection, Human-Machine interaction, Industry 4.0, Machine learning, Predictive

Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Indiana University of Pennsylvania>, <Department of Information Systems, Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>, <Azman Hashim International Business School, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia>",,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.","Information systems, Service-Oriented Architecture, SOA, Success factors, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<An exploratory study for investigating the issues and current practices of service-oriented architecture adoption, {eid: 85068423836, doi: 10.32890/jict2019.18.3.3}>, <A research on SOA in the IT industry of Pakistan, {eid: 85066803017, doi: 10.1145/3323933.3324080}>, <State of the practice in service identification for SOA migration in industry, {eid: 85056896158, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_46}>, <Energy-aware services composition for Internet of Things, {eid: 85050466884, doi: 10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355213}>, <Event-driven SOA-based iot architecture, {eid: 85040241178, doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-5520-1_24}>, <SOAP-based web service for localization of multi-robot system in cloud, {eid: 85057109748, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-01177-2_29}>, <Cloud computing as a facilitator for web service composition in factory automation, {eid: 84994218554, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1277-z}>, <A case-based reasoning approach to reuse quality-driven designs in service-oriented architectures, {eid: 85049518388, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2018.06.003}>, <Service-oriented architecture: myths, realities, and a maturity model, {eid: 79951897344}>, <Critical factors in the effective of service-oriented architecture, {eid: 84902963791}>, <A proposition of critical success factors influencing SOA implementation in healthcare, {eid: 84905748849}>, <Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and Technology, {eid: 34548309673}>, <Web services architecture w3c working group note 11, {eid: 0142074003}>, <Service-oriented architecture scenario, {eid: 33646928571, doi: 10.2111/REM-D-09-00117.1}>, <Defining SOA as an architectural style: Align your business model with technology, {eid: 41949090570}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture Compass: Business Value, Planning, and Enterprise Roadmap, {eid: 29744464022}>, <Enterprise SOA: Service-oriented architecture best practices, {eid: 33744509965}>, <Service-oriented architecture unlocking hidden value in insurance systems, {eid: 85078544363}>, <Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, {eid: 4644300495}>, <SOA: Principles of Service Design, Vol. 1, {eid: 35549003927}>, <Enterprise Service Oriented Architectures: Concepts, Challenges, Recommendations, {eid: 38549091817}>, <Reference model for service oriented architecture 1.0.

This paper presents the design methodology, mathematical analysis, simulation study, and experimental validation of a digital twin approach for fault diagnosis. We develop a digital twin that estimates the measurable characteristic outputs of a PV energy conversion unit (PVECU) in real time. The PVECU constitutes a PV source and a source-level power converter. The fault diagnosis is performed by generating and evaluating an error residual vector, which is the difference between the estimated and measured outputs. A PV panel-level power converter prototype is built to demonstrate how the sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities of the converter can enable effective fault diagnosis in real time. The experimental results show detection and identification of ten different faults in the PVECU. The time to fault detection (FD) in the power converter and the electrical sensors is less than 290 μs and the identification time is less than 4 ms. The time to FD and identification in the PV panel are less than 80 ms and 1.2 s, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates higher fault sensitivity than that of existing approaches.

Primarily, MBSE was used to manage complex engineering projects in terms of system requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities, leaving security aspects aside. However, previous research showed that security requirements and risks could be tackled in the MBSE model, and powerful MBSE tools such as simulation, change impact analysis, automated document generation, validation, and verification could be successfully reused in the multidisciplinary field. This article analyzes various security-related techniques and then clarifies how these techniques can be represented in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) model and then further exploited with MBSE tools. The paper introduces the MBSEsec method, which gives guidelines for the security analysis process, the SysML/UML-based security profile, and recommendations on what security technique is needed at each security process phase.

Major socio-economic risks on Japan's STI ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. Shifting from a push-based STI ecosystem to a pull-based STI ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in Society 5.0.","Data-driven innovation, Productivity and growth, Science, Society 5.0, STI ecosystem, System resilience, Technology and innovation",,,,,,,,"<Research on a Japanese Model of Open Innovation, {eid: 85070675627}>, <Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem, {eid: 33645683761}>, <Competition, Innovation And Productivity Growth: A Review Of Theory And Evidence (OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 317), {eid: 0141458589}>, <Smart times: smart society plan ‘society 5.0’.

Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain, achieves great success and promotes more development in this field. However, Bitcoin encounters performance problems of low throughput and high transaction latency. Other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work also inherit the flaws, leading to more concerns about the scalability of blockchain. This paper attempts to cover the existing scaling solutions for blockchain and classify them by level. In addition, we make comparisons between different methods and list some potential directions for solving the scalability problem of blockchain.","Blockchain, scalability",,,,,,,,"<Bitcoin: A

Adoption of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) continues to grow in industry and government, and MBSE continues to be a major research theme in the systems engineering community. In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.","literature review, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), value of systems engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85098444299}>, <None, {eid: 84969745906}>, <None, {eid: 85098450005}>, <None, {eid: 85095978973}>, <The SERC 5-year technical plan: designing the future of systems engineering research, {eid: 85098446608}>, <None, {eid: 85098444046}>, <A framework for agile development of simulation-based system design tools, {eid: 84883030308}>, <A model-based approach for requirements engineering for systems of systems, {eid: 85027919334}>, <MBSE in rail transportation–product families and product lines, {eid: 85063097750}>, <State-of-practice survey of model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85052963713}>, <Current modeling trends in systems engineering, {eid: 85044470320}>, <MBSE applicability analysis in Chinese industry, {eid: 85098450187}>, <MBSE applicability analysis, {eid: 84929802358}>, <Should I stay or should I go?

In this study we elaborated the definitions and usages of the term ‘system model’, to find a common definition. We analyzed 104 publications in depth for their usage and definition as well as their meta-data e.g., the publication year and publication background to find some common patterns. While the term is gaining more interest in recent years, it is used in a broad range of contexts for both analytical and synthetic use cases. Based on this, three categories of system models have been defined and integrated into a more precise definition.","Model informatics and analytics, Model-based collaboration, Model-based systems

Recent advances in multiband (MB) and multiecho (ME) techniques have greatly improved fMRI methods. MB imaging improves temporal and/or spatial resolution, while ME imaging has been shown to improve BOLD sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the novel MBME echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence utilizing MB and ME simultaneously to determine if the MBME outperform the MB single echo (MBSE) sequence for task fMRI. Purpose: To compare the performance of MBME with MBSE in a task fMRI study. Study Type: Prospective. Population: A total of 29 healthy volunteers aged 20–46 years (9 male, 20 female). Field Strength/Sequence: MBSE and MBME gradient-echo EPI sequences were applied at 3T. Additional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) was collected. Assessment: A checkerboard visual task was presented during the functional MBSE and MBME scans. The MBME or MBSE signal was evaluated using the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR). Task activation was evaluated using the z-score, volume, sensitivity, and specificity. Test–retest metrics of task activation were examined with the Dice coefficient (DC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on subjects with repeated scans. Statistical Tests: A linear mixed-effects model was used to compared MBME and MBSE activation at the voxel base. The paired t-test was used to compare tSNR, activation z-score, and volume, along with sensitivity, specificity, and DC between MBSE and MBME. Results: While similar task activation was detected in the visual cortex, MBME showed higher activation volume and higher sensitivity compared with MBSE (P < 0.05). ICC was higher for MBME than MBSE, while there was a trend of differences in DC (P = 0.08). Data Conclusion: MBME resulted in higher task fMRI activation volume and sensitivity without losing specificity. Reliability was also higher for MBME scans compared with MBSE. Level of Evidence: 1.

For the traditional vehicle system safety analysis and design, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are usually conducted to evaluate the risk. However, for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), the autonomous system is more complex, and there are a lot of interactions among subsystems. Conventional hazard analysis methods on the basis of the linear chain of events are not applicable to CAVs because it is difficult to identify the potential hazards caused by system interactions or performance limits. A new hazard analysis method based on control theory and system theory, Systems Theory Process Analysis (STPA), can identify the potential hazards from the view of the whole system. Besides, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach is introduced to improve the consistency and traceability. In this article, a model-based hazard analysis method combining STPA and MBSE is proposed, which can map the development process in compliance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26262 and Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) standards. System assumptions and architecture from system engineering foundations can be used to form the item definition in the safety analysis process. Hazards can be identified by the STPA method based on preliminary system functions. Furthermore, causal factors and safety constraints from Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) can help developers to generate functional safety requirements and modify the preliminary system architecture. The Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system is taken as a typical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The hazardous state and casual factors for the AEB system is identified by STPA based on the system model, which is described by the systems modeling language (SysML). Meanwhile, the analysis results give the guidance for a safety-related system design. The proposed workflow promotes the collaboration between the system designer and safety analyzer and accelerates the system development iterations process.","Automatic emergency braking system, MBSE, Process approach, Safety analysis, STPA",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85061055790}>, <None, {eid: 85103211463}>, <None, {eid: 85103205077}>, <Towards ""vision Zero, {eid: 85072503764}>, <Domain Control Units - The Solution for Future E/E Architectures?, {eid: 85072350096}>, <Intelligent Vehicle Monitoring for Safety and Security, {eid: 85064710754}>, <None, {eid: 85103164353}>, <None, {eid: 85103212842}>, <An Approach to Support FMEA Specification in Automotive Systems, {eid: 84938309888}>, <Use of Fault Tree Analysis for Automotive Reliability and Safety Analysis, {eid: 85072444138}>, <Optimization-Based Robust Architecture Design for Autonomous Driving System, {eid: 85064604474}>, <A New Accident Model for Engineering Safer Systems, {eid: 1342344540}>, <Autonomous Driving in Agriculture Leading to Autonomous Worksite Solutions, {eid: 85016491814}>, <Towards a Supermileage Autonomous Vehicle, {eid: 85018456959}>, <Safety Assessment of Complex, Software-Intensive Systems, {eid: 84871259042}>, <Deriving Verification Objectives and Scenarios for Maritime Systems Using the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis, {eid: 85026731435}>, <WE-G-BRA-07: Analyzing the Safety Implications of a Brachytherapy Process Improvement Project Utilizing a Novel System-Theory-Based Hazard-Analysis Technique, {eid: 85103205480}>, <Safety Analysis Based on Systems Theory Applied to an Unmanned Protective Vehicle, {eid: 85017379847}>, <Application of Systems Theoretic Process Analysis to a Lane Keeping Assist System, {eid: 85103175528}>, <None, {eid: 85103155042}>, <None, {eid: 85103171522}>, <None, {eid: 85103186266}>, <Review and Assessment of the ISO 26262 Draft Road Vehicle - Functional Safety, {eid: 85072507925}>, <Developing Functional Safety Requirements Using Process Model Variables, {eid: 84938347333}>, <Challenges in Managing ISO 26262 Software Development Projects, {eid: 84938306850}>, <Calculating Probability Metric for Random Hardware Failures (PMHF) in the New Version of ISO 26262 Functional Safety - Methodology and Case Studies, {eid: 85045419835}>, <Control Model of Automated Driving Systems Based on SOTIF Evaluation, {eid: 85083859783}>, <Integrating SOTIF and Agile Systems Engineering, {eid: 85064634353}>, <Assessing the Safety of Environment Perception in Automated Driving Vehicles, {eid: 85102148611}>, <None, {eid: 85066815225}>, <Hazard Analysis Method Based on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process, {eid: 85096471235}>, <A System-Theoretic Accident Model and Process with Human Factors Analysis and Classification System Taxonomy, {eid: 85047056769}>",,,SAE International,,,3/3/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85103185979

However, with the shift toward more dynamic and flexible supply chains, privacy concerns severely challenge the required information retrieval. A lack of trust between the different involved stakeholders inhibits advanced, multi-hop information flows, as valuable information for tracking and tracing products and parts is either unavailable or only retained locally. Our extensive literature review of previous approaches shows that these needs for cross-company information retrieval are widely acknowledged, but related work currently only addresses them insufficiently. To overcome these concerns, we present PrivAccIChain, a secure, privacy-preserving architecture for improving the multi-hop information retrieval with stakeholder accountability along supply chains. To address use case-specific needs, we particularly introduce an adaptable configuration of transparency and data privacy within our design. Hence, we enable the benefits of information sharing as well as multi-hop tracking and tracing even in supply chains that include mutually distrusting stakeholders. We evaluate the performance of PrivAccIChain and demonstrate its real-world feasibility based on the information of a purchasable automobile, the e.GO Life. We further conduct an in-depth security analysis and propose tunable mitigations against common attacks. As such, we attest PrivAccIChain's practicability for information management even in complex supply chains with flexible and dynamic business relationships.","Attribute-based encryption, e.GO,

Building on literature in moral and legal philosophy, and ethics of technology, the paper proposes a broader and more comprehensive analysis of the responsibility gap. The responsibility gap, it is argued, is not one problem but a set of at least four interconnected problems – gaps in culpability, moral and public accountability, active responsibility—caused by different sources, some technical, other organisational, legal, ethical, and societal. Responsibility gaps may also happen with non-learning systems. The paper clarifies which aspect of AI may cause which gap in which form of responsibility, and why each of these gaps matter. It proposes a critical review of partial and non-satisfactory attempts to address the responsibility gap: those which present it as a new and intractable problem (“fatalism”), those which dismiss it as a false problem (“deflationism”), and those which reduce it to only one of its dimensions or sources and/or present it as a problem that can be solved by simply introducing new technical and/or legal tools (“solutionism”). The paper also outlines a more comprehensive approach to address the responsibility gaps with AI in their entirety, based on the idea of designing socio-technical systems for “meaningful human control"", that is systems aligned with the relevant human reasons and capacities.","AI and accountability, AI ethics, Engineer responsibility, Meaningful human control, Responsibility gap",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85097864150}>, <Article 36, {eid: 85105924887}>, <A body to kick, but still no soul to damn: Legal perspectives on robotics, {eid: 84876855637}>, <None, {eid: 85104771203}>, <Fatal U.S, {eid: 85105964370}>, <).

This article explores the impact of design factors of the robotic interface (anthropomorphic vs functional) and usage context (production vs care) on human-robot trust and attributions. Theresults of a scenario-based survey with N = 228 N=228 participants showed a higher willingness to collaborate with production robots compared to care. Context and design influenced the trust attributed to the robots: robots with a technical appearance in production were trusted more than anthropomorphic robots or robots in the care context. The evaluation of attributions by means of a semanticdifferential showed that differences in robot design were less pronounced for the production context in comparison to the care context. In the latter, anthropomorphic robots were associated with positive attributes. The results contribute to a better understanding of the complex nature of trust in automation and can be used to identify and shape use case-specific risk perceptions as well as perceived opportunities to interacting with collaborative robots. Findings of this study are pertinent to research (e.g., experts in human-robot interaction) and industry, with special regard given tothe technical development and design.","assistance robotics, attribution, collaborative robotics, human-robot collaboration, human-robot interaction, semantic differential, technology acceptance, trust in automation",,,,,,,,"<""human-robot collaboration: A survey,"", {eid: 84938150940}>, <""world Population Prospects 2019.

Such deployments rely on the flexibility and scalability of systems and devices. Heterogeneous systems need to be interoperable and work together seamlessly. In order to manage such system of systems, it is important to work with a framework that not only supports the flexible nature of IoT systems but also provides adequate support for industrial requirements, such as real-time and runtime features, architectural approaches, hardware constraints, standardization, industrial support, interoperability, and security. The selection of an appropriate framework results difficult due to the rising number of available frameworks and platforms, which offer different support for the aforementioned requirements. Therefore, this article investigates the features of seven prominent frameworks for the purpose of simplifying the selection of a suitable framework for an industrial application.

Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.","advanced manufacturing technology, Industry 4.0, literature review, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Assessment of Virtual Reality-Based

Once it is deployed, a critical system cannot be made unavailable for the purpose of simulating a cyber attack and thus it is hard to introduce corrective measures based on actual test outcomes. On the other hand, a high security posture is required for critical infrastructure and security by design is mandatory for new projects. Such requirements call for an architectural approach to introduce security straight from the early development phases. However, the adoption of a systematic design approach does not guarantee the cost-effectiveness of security countermeasures analysis, which is an extremely cumbersome task as the creation of a physical model is often costly or impossible. To address these issues, we propose the introduction of a specific view in the system’s architectural blueprint, called the Cybersecurity Digital Twin. It is an Enterprise Architecture model of the system specifically targeted at providing a sound base for simulations in order to devise proper countermeasures without any outage of the physical infrastructure. To provide a proof of concept and demonstrate the practical viability of the proposed solution, we apply the methodology to a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System use case, evaluating the system security of the obtained solution.","C-ITS, Cyber security, Digital twin, Threat modeling",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85119832588}>, <The industry use cases for the digital twin idea, Chap. 4, {eid: 85119865810}>, <Cyberfactory1-securing the industry 4.0 with cyber-ranges and digital twins, {eid: 85050025311}>, <A digital twin-based privacy enhancement mechanism for the automotive industry, {eid: 85065981827}>, <Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center, {eid: 85117542440}>, <Towards security-aware virtual environments for digital twins, {eid: 85056740434}>, <Digital twins for cyber-physical systems security: State of the art and outlook, {eid: 85149551859}>, <None, {eid: 85119822859}>, <None, {eid: 85119853169}>, <None, {eid: 85119872997}>, <None, {eid: 85119824432}>, <None, {eid: 85119828506}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85119885703}>, <None, {eid: 85119833834}>, <None, {eid: 85119825364}>, <None, {eid: 85119859181}>, <A meta language for threat modeling and attack simulations, {eid: 85063280304}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Analyzing the effectiveness of attack countermeasures in a SCADA system, {eid: 85019036296}>, <None, {eid: 85119859339}>, <A state-of-the-art survey of Digital Twin: Techniques, engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation perspectives, {eid: 85075384583}>, <None, {eid: 85103470058}>, <None, {eid: 85111413823}>, <None, {eid: 85119851496}>, <None, {eid: 85119868048}>, <Change impact analysis of feature models, {eid: 84866719344}>, <None, {eid: 85119869508}>, <The Open Group: Reference Architectures and Open Group Standards for the Internet of Things-Four Internet of, {eid: 85119858124}>, <United States Department of Transportation.

Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems.","Architecture, Controlled environment agriculture, Digital twin, Optimization, Productivity",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85087340838}>, <None, {eid: 85042563333}>, <Temperature increase reduces global yields of major crops in four independent estimates, {eid: 85028561747}>, <None, {eid: 85073331006}>, <None, {eid: 71649088197}>, <Global threats to human water security and river biodiversity, {eid: 77957341228}>, <Controlled environment food production for urban agriculture, {eid: 85077971423}>, <Review of energy efficiency in controlled environment agriculture, {eid: 85100551408}>, <Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment agriculture: A transition to plant factories and urban agriculture, {eid: 85042150131}>, <None, {eid: 34250189461}>, <Future food-production systems: Vertical farming and controlled-environment agriculture, {eid: 85042492387}>, <None, {eid: 85082256588}>, <Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms, {eid: 85089611838}>, <Lettuce growth and quality optimization in a plant factory, {eid: 84973598861}>, <Plant factories versus greenhouses: Comparison of resource use efficiency, {eid: 85034756098}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

In this paper we present a novel, modular digital twinning framework developed for the investigation of safety within collaborative robotic manufacturing processes. The modular architecture supports scalable representations of user-defined cyber-physical environments, and tools for safety analysis and control. This versatile research tool facilitates the creation of mixed environments of Digital Models, Digital Shadows, and Digital Twins, whilst standardising communication and physical system representation across different hardware platforms. The framework is demonstrated as applied to an industrial case-study focused on the safety assurance of a collaborative robotic manufacturing process. We describe the creation of a digital twin scenario, consisting of individual digital twins of entities in the manufacturing case study, and the application of a synthesised safety controller from our wider work. We show how the framework is able to provide adequate evidence to virtually assess safety claims made against the safety controller using a supporting validation module and testing strategy. The implementation, evidence and safety investigation is presented and discussed, raising exciting possibilities for the use of digital twins in robotic safety assurance.","automated code generation, collaborative robot safety, digital twins, human-robot collaboration, modular framework, probabilistic model checking, risk-informed software synthesis, robotics",,,,,,,,"<A Classification Proposal of Digital Twin Applications in the Safety Domain, {eid: 85100026730, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2021.107137}>, <Is Digital Twin Technology Supporting Safety Management?

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability, interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability, and the CDT model’s integration in practice besides decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.","Artificial intelligence, Building lifecycle management, Cognitive, Decision support, Digital twins, IoT, Optimization, Self-learning",,,,,,,,"<A Concept for

The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), aims at reducing the effort needed for changes in industrial production lines. The key benefits of next-generation manufacturing systems are less downtimes and the production of small lot sizes down to lot size 1. I4.0 does not introduce a silver bullet technology, but requires a transformation of the system architecture of production systems. In the literature, however, there systematic guidance for designing manufacturing systems that address central I4.0 use cases like plug'n'produce and end-to-end communication is still missing, as are details on the infrastructure needed to enable I4.0 technologies such as Digital Twins. To contribute to filling this gap, this paper presents (i) a Digital Twin architecture blueprint driven by central I4.0 use cases and (ii) a prototypical open-source implementation of the architecture using the concept of the Asset Administration Shell.","Asset Administration Shell, Digital Twin, Industrial Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, ""PlugnProduce"", Software Architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?industry forum, {eid: 84903134983}>, <Sustainable industrial value creation: Benefits and challenges of industry 4.0, {eid: 85035783173}>, <None, {eid: 29944439716}>, <None, {eid: 84930743616}>, <Blueprints for architecture drivers and architecture solutions for Industry 4.0 shopfloor applications, {eid: 85107223377}>, <An application framework of digital twin and its case study, {eid: 85049576881}>, <Enabling industry 4.0 service-oriented architecture through digital twins, {eid: 85107211820}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <None, {eid: 85107220030}>, <Software engineering in industrial automation: State-of-The-Art review, {eid: 84883037727}>, <None, {eid: 84952899781}>, <None, {eid: 85107189584}>, <The stuttgart it architecture for manufacturing, {eid: 85071374517}>, <None, {eid: 85034604760}>, <None, {eid: 85107203318}>, <None, {eid: 85107221533}>, <Industry 4.0: Towards future industrial opportunities and challenges, {eid: 84966558951}>, <The role of the Industry 4.0 asset administration shell and the digital twin during the life cycle of a plant, {eid: 85044475829}>, <OpenPnP: A plug-And-produce architecture for the industrial internet of things, {eid: 85072105304}>, <None, {eid: 85107204234}>, <The use of Digital Twin for predictive maintenance in manufacturing, {eid: 85074990841}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85107203650}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in IIoT systems, {eid: 85062630045}>, <None, {eid: 85073869890}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smartworkshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,5/26/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85107191722

For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS. This study thus contributes toward the advancement of intelligent machine tools from the context of smart manufacturing.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Machine tool, Monitoring, Sensor

However, the dilemma between the scope and scale needs a sophisticated reference architecture, a right set of technologies, and a suitable business model. Most studies in the Digital Twin field have only focused on manufacturing and proposed explicit frameworks and architecture, which faced challenges to support different integration levels through an agile process. Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between Digital Twin capabilities as a service and mass individualization.","Augmented reality, Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Industry

How to systematically monitor and evaluate its overall real-time operation status, and to invoke the most appropriate decision-making level, use the most economical computational resource, and conduct a synchronized decision-making and control to the most accurate operation scope to address a randomly occurred dynamics has remained a long-term challenge for researchers. This paper proposes a multi-level cloud computing enabled digital twin system for the real-time monitor, decision and control of a synchronized production logistics system. In the IoT-driven production logistics synchronization (PLS) system with complete real-time information, the dynamics that occurred in the physical layer could be accurately and real-timely captured and its negative effects on the system's overall operation state could be effectively evaluated in the digital layer. For slight, moderate and severe dynamics, edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing and their dynamically formed multi-level distributed decision-making system will be used to deal with the dynamics in the most effective and economical mode. Finally, the PLS optimization model of production and storage is presented with an industrial case, and the effectiveness is also demonstrated and analyzed.","Cloud computing, Digital Twin, Edge computing, Fog computing, Production logistics, Synchronization",,,,,,,,"<Internet-of-things based dynamic synchronization of production and logistics: Mechanism, System and Case Study, {eid: 84949956483}>, <Synchronized Decision-making and Control Method for Opti-state Execution of Dynamic Production Systems with Internet of Things, {eid: 85056344896, doi: 10.3901/JME.2018.16.024}>, <Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics synchronization mechanism and method toward customer order dynamics, {eid: 85018782598, doi: 10.1177/0142331217691218}>, <CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud computing and internet of things-based cloud manufacturing service system, {eid: 84896931467, doi: 10.1109/TII.2014.2306383}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143, doi: 10.1115/MSEC2018-6435}>, <Cavitation phenomena in the injection nozzle: theoretical and numerical analysis, {eid: 80054776618}>, <Flexible machine layout design for dynamic and uncertain production environments, {eid: 0032122942}>, <Towards IoT-enabled dynamic service optimal selection in multiple manufacturing clouds, {eid: 85086824960, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.004}>, <A fault-tolerant control strategy for multiple automated guided vehicles, {eid: 85080141919, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.02.009}>, <New integration of preventive maintenance and production planning with cell formation and group scheduling for dynamic cellular manufacturing systems, {eid: 85087394458, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.011}>, <A multi-objective algorithm for task scheduling and resource allocation in cloud-based disassembly, {eid: 84991271089, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.09.008}>, <Coordinating order acceptance and integrated production-distribution scheduling with batch delivery considering Third Party Logistics distribution, {eid: 85034077664, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.11.001}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152, doi: 10.13196/j.cims.2017.08.001}>, <Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication, 2014, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Isogeometric Fatigue Damage Prediction in Large-Scale Composite Structures Driven by Dynamic Sensor Data, {eid: 84953888837, doi: 10.1115/1.4030795}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958, doi: 10.1115/SMASIS2015-8975}>, <A travel-time model for a person-onboard order picking system, {eid: 69249215373}>, <RFID-based wireless manufacturing for real-time management of job shop WIP inventories, {eid: 51849166450, doi: 10.1007/s00170-006-0897-4}>, <Cloud manufacturing: A computing and service-oriented manufacturing model, {eid: 84862908560, doi: 10.1177/0954405411405575}>, <Digital Twin Data Modeling with AutomationML and a Communication Methodology for Data Exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <Digital-twin-driven geometric optimization of centrifugal impeller with free- form blades for fi ve-axis fl ank milling, {eid: 85087755544, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.019}>, <MES-integrated digital twin frameworks, {eid: 85085180521, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.05.007}>, <Digital Twin as Enabler for an Innovative Digital Shopfloor Management System in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen -

In this paper, the realization of digital twin is studied for geometric feature online inspection system of body-in-white (BIW). A three-level virtual modeling approach of Element-Behavior-Rule is proposed for the physical environment modeling in a digital environment. An element model, behavior model and rule model are defined, respectively, and the relationship among the three-layer model is given for real-time communication. A three-layer communication architecture of the digital twin system is designed for the real-time mapping between physical and virtual space, and the process of the online inspection digital twin system is analyzed. Finally, on the basis of the online inspection physical experimental platform and JHIM (Jiangheng Intelligent Manufacturing) software platform, the digital twin system for geometric feature online inspection of BIW is developed, which shows that the virtual model can be driven in real time by real-time physical inspection data. Digital twin technology provides a feasible way for real-time monitoring of the online inspection system.","data real-time mapping, Digital twin, online detection, online inspection system",,,,,,,,"<Digital Twins: The Convergence of Multimedia Technologies, {eid: 85051272175, doi: 10.1109/MMUL.2018.023121167}>, <Next Generation Digital Twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <Digital Twin as Enabler for an Innovative Digital Shopfloor Management System in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen–University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Industrial IoT Lifecycle via Digital Twins, {eid: 85006877926}>, <A Simulation-Based Architecture for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <Challenges with Structural Life Forecasting Using Realistic Mission Profiles, {eid: 84881391199}>, <Digital Twin: Manufacturing Excellence through Virtual Factory Replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Modular Based Flexible Digital Twin for Factory Design, {eid: 85050657407, doi: 10.1007/s12652-018-0953-6}>, <Digital Twin–Proof of Concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <Digital Twin for Adaptation of Robots’ Behavior in Flexible Robotic Assembly Lines, {eid: 85071655549, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2018.12.020}>, <Dynamic Bayesian Network for Aircraft Wing Health Monitoring Digital Twin, {eid: 85014566387, doi: 10.2514/1.J055201}>, <Multi-physics Response of Structural Composites and Framework for Modeling Using Material Geometry, {eid: 84881323822}>, <A Digital Twin for Rapid Qualification of 3D Printed Metallic Components, {eid: 85056629776, doi: 10.1016/j.apmt.2018.11.003}>, <A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-based Production Systems, {eid: 85029833606, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.198}>, <Digital Twin and Big Data Towards Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: 360 Degree Comparison, {eid: 85041173790, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2793265}>, <About the Importance of Autonomy and Digital Twins for the Future of Manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.141}>, <From Simulation to Experimentable Digital Twins: Simulation-based Development and Operation of Complex Technical Systems, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital Twin Data Modeling with AutomationML and a Communication Methodology for Data Exchange, {eid: 85006391498, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.11.115}>, <DRAFT Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology & Processing Roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <Toward a Digital Twin for Real-time Geometry Assurance in Individualized Production, {eid: 85018779245, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2017.04.038}>, <Digital Twin-Driven Product Design, Manufacturing and Service with Big Data, {eid: 85015707925, doi: 10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1}>, <Digital Twin-Driven Product Design Framework, {eid: 85042921933, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2018.1443229}>, <Digital Twin Shop-Floor: A New Shop-Floor Paradigm Towards Smart Manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756069}>, <The Airframe Digital Twin: Some Challenges to Realization, {eid: 84881387801}>, <Virtual Monitoring Method for Hydraulic Supports Based on Digital Twin Theory, {eid: 85060570903, doi: 10.1080/25726668.2019.1569367}>, <A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning, {eid: 85062237403, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890566}>",,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,1/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85081751613

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)Complex manufacturing and supply chain systems consist of concurrent labour-intensive processes and procedures with repetitive time-consuming tasks and multiple quality checks. These features may pose challenges for the efficient operation and management, while manual tasks may significantly increase human errors or near misses, having impact on the propagation of effects and parallel interactions within these systems. In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, a digital twin (DT) integrated in a multi-agent cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) with the help of RFID technology is proposed. The proposed reference architecture tends to improve the trackability and traceability of complex manufacturing processes. In this research work, the interactions occurring both within a single complex manufacturing system and between multiple sites within a supply chain are considered. For the implementation of the integrated DT-CPMS, a simulation model employing the agent-based modelling technique is developed. A case study from a cryogenic supply chain in the UK is also selected to show the application and validity of the proposed digital solution. The results prove that the DT-CPMS architecture can improve system's performance in terms of human, equipment and space utilisations.","Agent-based modelling, Complex manufacturing, Cyber-Physical System, Digital twin, RFID",,,,,,,,"<C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical System for sustainable project Scheduling, {eid: 85079645451}>, <Defining a digital twin-based Cyber-physical production System for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85086260271}>, <A modular hybrid simulation framework for complex manufacturing system design, {eid: 85061135493}>, <RFID application in a multi-agent cyber physical manufacturing system, {eid: 85106918005}>, <A review on human-centered IoT-connected smart labels for the industry 4.0, {eid: 85046488692}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <Blockchain-based data management for digital twin of product, {eid: 85079151075}>, <Reference framework for digital twins within cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <The multi-agent approach for developing a cyber-physical system for managing precise farms with digital twins of plants, {eid: 85077607130}>, <A Cyber-physical systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <FMU-supported simulation for CPS digital twin, {eid: 85070631431}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical production system architectural framework for personalized production, {eid: 85076628276}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationML and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Digital twins and cyber-physical systems toward smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: Correlation and comparison, {eid: 85068798049}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Development of a smart cyber-physical manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context, {eid: 85070961256}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <Digital twin-driven cyber-physical production system towards smart, {eid: 85120705540}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,6/7/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85120686175

One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: ‘What is a Digital Twin?’; ‘Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?’; ‘When has a Digital Twin to be developed?’; ‘Why should a Digital Twin be used?’; ‘How to design and implement a Digital Twin?’; ‘What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?’.

Based on the digital twin technology, a quad-play CMCO (i.e., Configuration design-Motion planning-Control development-Optimization decoupling) design architecture is put forward for the design of the flow-type smart manufacturing system in the Industry 4.0 context. The iteration logic of the CMCO design model is expounded. Two key enabling technologies for enabling the customized and software-defined design of flow-type smart manufacturing systems are presented, including the generalized encapsulation of the quad-play CMCO model and the digital twin technique. A prototype of a digital twin-based manufacturing system design platform, named Digital Twin System, is presented based on the CMCO model. The digital twin-based design platform is verified with a case study of the hollow glass smart manufacturing system. The result shows that the Digital Twin System-based design approach is feasible and efficient.","Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Manufacturing system design, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<Reference architectures for smart manufacturing: a critical review, {eid: 85056448761}>, <Challenges for the cyber-physical manufacturing enterprises of the future, {eid: 85061639439}>, <Towards a generic design method for reconfigurable manufacturing systems: analysis and synthesis of current design methods and evaluation of supportive tools, {eid: 85009070856}>, <Rapid-response design, {eid: 0031362375}>, <A knowledge engineering framework for rapid design, {eid: 0031249123}>, <Developing an efficient space system Rapid design center, {eid: 0034855471, doi: 10.1109/AERO.2001.931429}>, <The application of a knowledge based engineering approach to the rapid design and analysis of an automotive structure, {eid: 0035545903}>, <Axiomatic design of mechanical systems, {eid: 0029323790}>, <Allocating facilities with CRAFT, {eid: 0000881563}>, <A simulated annealing algorithm for allocating space to manufacturing cells, {eid: 0026745401}>, <Use of the manufacturing system design decomposition for comparative analysis and effective design of production systems, {eid: 84981736269}>, <Reconfigurable manufacturing systems, {eid: 0033340198}>, <Knowledge-based PPR modelling for assembly automation, {eid: 85040614026}>, <Knowledge-based design for assembly in agile manufacturing by using Data Mining methods, {eid: 85009212122}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Data-driven smart manufacturing, {eid: 85040599054}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <Toward a Digital Twin for real-time geometry assurance in individualized production, {eid: 85018779245}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85042921933}>, <Digital twin the Simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-32156-1_5}>, <C2PS: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing: connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Simulation for manufacturing system design and operation: literature review and analysis, {eid: 84897115618}>, <Survey on the use of simulation for manufacturing system design and operation, {eid: 3042692204}>, <Decision-making method of reconfigurable manufacturing systems’ reconfiguration by a Gale-Shapley model, {eid: 85030121435}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <Digital twin-based process reuse and evaluation approach for smart process planning, {eid: 85054681959}>, <Contextual self-organizing of manufacturing process for mass individualization: a cyber-physical-social system approach, {eid: 85046421596, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1470259}>, <Digital twin for CNC machine tool: modeling and using strategy, {eid: 85050765931}>, <Digital Twin for rotating machinery fault diagnosis in smart manufacturing, {eid: 85058187499}>, <ManuChain: combining permissioned blockchain with a holistic optimization model as Bi-Level intelligence for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85077732979}>, <Dynamic scheduling in RFID-driven discrete manufacturing system by using multi-layer network metrics as heuristic information, {eid: 85011931037}>, <Digital twin-driven rapid individualized designing of automated flow-shop manufacturing system, {eid: 85046619993}>, <An integer programming model for two- and three-stage two-dimensional cutting stock problems, {eid: 77649338362}>, <Models and algorithms for three-stage two-dimensional bin packing, {eid: 34447093261}>, <Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model, {eid: 85076833589}>, <Quality prediction in manufacturing system design, {eid: 59849125667}>, <Design of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, {eid: 79953281016}>, <Robust manufacturing system design using multi objective genetic algorithms, Petri nets and Bayesian uncertainty representation, {eid: 84875268759}>, <Digital twin-driven joint optimisation of packing and storage assignment in large-scale automated high-rise warehouse product-service system, {eid: 85073998436, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2019.1667032}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85074335396, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.10.001}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,1/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85083837378

The combination with advanced data analytics and information and communication technologies allows Digital Twins to perform real-time simulation, optimization and prediction to their physical counterparts. Efficient bi-directional data exchange is the foundation for Digital Twin implementation. However, the widely mentioned cloud-based architecture has disadvantages, such as high pressure on bandwidth and long latency time, which limit Digital Twins to provide real-time operating responses in dynamic manufacturing processes. Edge computing has the characteristics of low connectivity, the capability of immediate analysis and access to temporal data for real-time analytics, which makes it a fit-for-purpose technology for Digital Twin development. In this paper, the benefits of edge computing to Digital Twin are first explained through the reviews of the two technologies. The Digital Twin functions to be performed at the edge are then elaborated. After that, how the data model will be used in the edge for data mapping to realize the Digital Twin is illustrated and the data mapping strategy based on the EXPRESS schemas is discussed. Finally, a case study is carried out to verify the data mapping strategy based on EXPRESS schema.

While Industry 4.0 is still a big challenge for many manufacturing companies, reference architectures have been increasingly adopted in different domains to guide engineers on how their systems should interoperate and be structured. Companies have made different experiences with reference architectures for Industry 4.0. However, depending on the use cases addressed, a reference architecture may be more or less suited to support the transformation of a particular company. Besides, a complete understanding of existing representative architectures does not exist. The main goal of this work is to review existing reference architectures for Industry 4.0 and analyze them concerning their suitability for supporting Industry 4.0 processes and solutions. For this, we systematically researched these architectures and thoroughly analyzed and characterized them. We also address their use and technologies/tools that could support their implementation. As a result, we found that existing architectures still have a long way to go; hence, we present the most urgent steps for the near future. We conclude that the Industry 4.0 community is right in investing in reference architectures considering the future of Industry 4.0.","Industry 4.0, Interoperability, Reference architecture, Software

Digital twin provides support to users and processes in decision-making creating high-fidelity virtual models from physical objects in order to simulate their behaviors, predict their states, provide feedbacks, and if possible be optimized by themselves. The literature indicates an urgent need to develop digital twin applications. These applications require a digital platform that complies with DT requirements and allows all physical objects, virtual models, and industrial systems to communicate and integrate with each other. The contribution of this paper is to provide an analysis about digital twin (meaning and modeling), and to present a platform that works as: (1) a modern distributed system that runs as a cluster and can elastically scale to handle and integrate all the business applications, systems, and production data even the most massive data volumes; (2) a storage system that keeps data as long as necessary and provides real guarantees in delivery, persistence, performance (real time), reliability, and processing; (3) a real-time event-based platform that supports the requirements of digital twin applications including the management and support of different digital twin versions.","Digital twin, Event-based architecture, Real-time information, Smart production systems",,,,,,,,"<TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, {eid: 85112631124}>, <An industrial Internet of things based platform for context-aware information services in manufacturing, {eid: 85050917823, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2018.1500716}>, <None, {eid: 85112593671}>, <Apache Kafka.

Services are an essential part of almost every DT concept, but their interaction is usually implementation-specific since no common guidelines are available. This work identifies some fundamental requirements for a DT service framework based on applications identified in corresponding literature. Based on these requirements, a service framework architecture is proposed. The architecture utilizes Semantic Web technology and a workflow engine for service orchestration to support the fulfilment of the identified requirements. As a case study for sensor data evaluation of an industrial process, a proof-of-concept implementation is presented, showing the feasibility and suitability of the proposed DT service framework architecture.","Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Knowlege graph, Microservice, Semantic Web, Service architecture, Workflow engine",,,,,,,,"<Reviewing literature on digitalization, business model

Through digital twin technology, it is virtually possible to virtualize a product, process or service and the information interaction and co-evolution between physical and information world. Machine Learning (ML) can improve the cognitive, reasoning and decision-making abilities of the digital twin through knowledge extraction. The full life cycle management of complex equipment is considered the key to the intelligent transformation and upgrading of the modern manufacturing industry. The application of the above two technologies in the full life cycle management of complex equipment is going to make each stage of the life cycle more responsive, predictable and adaptable. In this study, we have proposed a full life cycle digital twin architecture for complex equipment.

The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.","artificial intelligence, big data, Digital twin, industry 40, machine

Web-based digital twin (WDT) has great potential for promoting sustainability in industrial cyber-physical systems. The current work demonstrates the mechanism by which a WDT architecture is established and utilised for improving sustainability. This is achieved by: a) accessing the control parameters that influence energy consumption, b) logging the energy consumption data and c) producing predictions by means of a computational algorithm. The objective is to support the system developer in delivering verified machine functionality along with trusted productivity and sustainability. The implementation is exemplified by an industrial case study adopted from a battery assembly production line.","Online technologies, Sustainability, Sustainable manufacturing, Web-based digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Virtual engineering in the support of sustainable assembly systems, {eid: 85100852318}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <None, {eid: 85112384663}>, <A prototype web-based user interface for sustainability modeling and optimization, {eid: 85112367657}>, <Sustainable manufacturing indicator repository, {eid: 84863583988}>, <Factory optima: A web-based system for composition and analysis of manufacturing service networks based on a reusable model repository, {eid: 85061330013}>, <Energy-efficient cyber-physical production network: Architecture and technologies, {eid: 85060116834}>, <Embedded digital twin for arti-type control of semi-continuous production processes, {eid: 85070592522}>, <Resource virtualization: A core technology for developing cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85046643014}>, <Towards industry 4. 0 with iot: Optimizing business processes in an evolving manufacturing factory, {eid: 85072729743}>, <Exploiting the digital twin in the assessment and optimization of sustainability performances, {eid: 85065990183}>, <Digital twin-based sustainable intelligent manufacturing: A review, {eid: 85072166366}>, <A digital twin for grinding wheel: An information sharing platform for sustainable grinding process, {eid: 85059482106}>, <Energy-aware resources in digital twin: The case of injection moulding machines, {eid: 85070656949}>, <Service-oriented platform for smart operation of dyeing and finishing industry, {eid: 85060933276}>, <Digital twin for energy optimization in an SMT-PCB assembly line, {eid: 85061704099}>, <Event-driven online machine state decision for energy-efficient manufacturing system based on digital twin using max-plus algebra, {eid: 85072638218}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and us air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Maintenance and digital health control in smart manufacturing based on condition monitoring, {eid: 85100866106}>, <None, {eid: 84984837118}>, <None, {eid: 0003754441}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,5/10/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85112350537

A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This article contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter, referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason, to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities as well as benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields.","Cyber-physical systems, digital twins (DTs), robotics",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85101762292}>, <None, {eid: 85101768198}>, <Digital twins of human robot collaboration in a production setting, {eid: 85060466179}>, <Integrated architecture for industrial robot programming and control, {eid: 0033309389}>, <Parallel simulation of virtual testbed applications, {eid: 85101763686}>, <Industry 4.0-digital twins and opc ua, {eid: 85101773235}>, <Digital twin driven human-robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252}>, <Digital twin and virtual reality: A co-simulation environment for design and assessment of industrial workstations, {eid: 85071966393}>, <Prototyping a digital twin for real time remote control overmobile networks:Application of remote surgery, {eid: 85062238969}>, <Integrating virtual reality and digital twin in circular economy practices: A laboratory application case, {eid: 85082818983}>, <Digital manufacturing tools in the simulation of collaborative robots: Towards industry 4.0, {eid: 85085079406}>, <Human robot interaction for future remote manipulations in industry 4.0, {eid: 85101740360}>, <Motion planning by integration of multiple policies for complex assembly tasks, {eid: 85101767758}>, <Design and constant force control of a parallel polishing machine, {eid: 84910683748}>, <Force control of cable-driven parallel robots, {eid: 84988532625}>, <On the role of robot configuration in cartesian stiffness control, {eid: 84938271186}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Methoden der mehrkörperdynamiksimulation als grundlage realitätsnaher virtueller welten, {eid: 84892853013}>, <Velocity-based shock propagation for multibody dynamics animation, {eid: 34547260224}>, <Robot collisions: A survey on detection, isolation, and identification, {eid: 85031806485}>, <A new coriolis matrix factorization, {eid: 84864438757}>, <Six-DOF impedance control based on angle/axis representations, {eid: 0032688337}>, <Stiffness identification for serial robot manipulator based on uncertainty approach, {eid: 84855411342}>, <None, {eid: 85101735661}>, <Extracting feasible robot parameters from dynamic coefficients using nonlinear optimizationmethods, {eid: 84977525156}>, <None, {eid: 84891583980}>, <Parallel particle swarm optimization on graphical processing unit for pose estimation, {eid: 84866986397}>, <An overview of null space projections for redundant, torque-controlled robots, {eid: 84942112766}>, <Mass and friction optimization for natural motion in hands-on robotic surgery, {eid: 84954535021}>, <Parameter selection and adaptation in unified particle swarm optimization, {eid: 34247548801}>, <Reaction null space of amultibody system with applications in robotics, {eid: 84897808915}>, <Optimal motion planning of a space robot with base disturbance minimization, {eid: 84897767365}>, <The fast research interface for the kuka lightweight robot, {eid: 78649663145}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,5/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85101785830

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is known to be a complex system because of its severe constraints as it controls critical applications. It is difficult to manage such networks and keep control of all the variables impacting their operation during their whole lifecycle. Meanwhile, Digital Twinning technology has been increasingly used to optimize the performances of industrial systems and has been ranked as one of the top ten most promising technological trends in the next decade. Many Digital Twins of industrial systems exist nowadays but only few are destined to networks. In this paper, we propose a holistic digital twinning architecture for the IIoT where the network is integrated along with the other industrial components of the system. To do so, the concept of Network Digital Twin is introduced. The main motivation is to permit a closed-loop network management across the whole network lifecycle, from the design to the service phase. Our architecture leverages the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm as an expression of network softwarization. Mainly, the SDN controller allows for setting up the connection between each Digital Twin of the industrial system and its physical counterpart. We validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture in the process of choosing the most suitable communication mechanism that satisfies the real-time requirements of a Flexible Production System.","Digital Twining, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, Software Defined Networks",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85057495661}>, <Smart factory performance and Industry 4.0, {eid: 85074301976}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry, {eid: 85065156908}>, <Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, {eid: 85049566739}>, <Digital Twin and Big Data Towards Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: 360 Degree Comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Numerical investigation of the interaction, transport and deposition of multicom-ponent droplets in a simple mouth-throat model, {eid: 85007417139}>, <Systems engineering and digital twin: A vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations, {eid: 85074479906}>, <None, {eid: 85120774828}>, <None, {eid: 85120826366}>, <Disaster City Digital Twin: A vision for integrating artificial and human intelligence for disaster management, {eid: 85077166289}>, <Reengineering aircraft structural life prediction using a digital twin, {eid: 84855216556}>, <A Maturity Model for Digital Twin Implementations in the Commercial Aerospace OEM Industry, {eid: 85113740805}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <Smart factory use case model based on digital twin, {eid: 85052236749}>, <Intelligent digital twin-based software-defined vehicular networks, {eid: 85087066942}>, <Digital Twin Network: Concepts and Reference Architecture, {eid: 85122777422}>, <Digital twin for 5G and beyond, {eid: 85102889168}>, <Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey, {eid: 84919935425}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling Innovation in Campus Networks, {eid: 85175624225}>, <Improving network management with software defined networking, {eid: 84873897891}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The Development of Digital Twin Technology Review, {eid: 85100925523}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <Digital twin: Manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Robust Additive Manufacturing Performance through a Control Oriented Digital Twin, {eid: 85104769822}>, <DT-II:Digital twin enhanced Industrial Internet reference framework towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85073509951}>, <Application-Driven Network-Aware Digital Twin Management in Industrial Edge Environments, {eid: 85103239228}>, <None, {eid: 85105575085}>, <None, {eid: 70349510694}>, <Murphy loves potatoes: Experiences from a pilot sensor network deployment in precision agriculture, {eid: 33847162489}>, <Design and implementation of a digital twin application for a connected micro smart factory, {eid: 85063878454}>, <None, {eid: 77955557900}>, <None, {eid: 85030326793}>, <SDN-WISE: Design, prototyping and experimentation of a stateful SDN solution for WIreless SEnsor networks, {eid: 84954204152}>, <SD-WISE: A Software-Defined WIreless SEnsor network, {eid: 85065823154}>, <From IEEE 802.15.4 to IEEE 802.15.4e: A Step Towards the Internet of Things, {eid: 84903692507}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e: A survey, {eid: 84973662796}>, <IEEE 802.15.4e in a Nutshell: Survey and Performance Evaluation, {eid: 85041409643}>, <Traffic Aware Scheduling Algorithm for Reliable Low-Power Multi-Hop IEEE 802.15.4e Networks, {eid: 84871986780}>",,,MDPI,,,12/1/2021,,,,,,34960288,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85120812912

To conduct fair and correct assessments, accessing accurate and up-to-date information for each property unit is vital. A collaborative research initiative has proposed an international Valuation Information Model Package that extends the ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) for specifying the semantics of valuation registries maintained by public authorities. The aim of this paper is to assess the possibility of using existing authoritative land and other public registries data as a basis of mass property valuation for public purposes. The results indicate that some of the required data already exists but is divided across different key registers. As a step towards implementation, identified attributes and parties were modelled using UML use case and class diagrams to explore possible data integration. By applying the proposed real property classification and valuation indicators, the Croatian property valuation system prototype for public purposes can be developed.","Compliance analysis, Immovable property valuation/taxation, LADM, Land registers",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85101864046}>, <Real estate mass appraisal in selected countries – functioning systems and proposed solutions, {eid: 84890923040, doi: 10.2478/remav-2013-0024}>, <A comparative analysis of methodologies for database schema integration, {eid: 0023023948, doi: 10.1145/27633.27634}>, <None, {eid: 85101873238}>, <Development of NSDIs in western balkan countries in accordance with INSPIRE, {eid: 84919386889}>, <None, {eid: 85101864882}>, <Developing automated valuation models for estimating property values: a comparison of global and locally weighted approaches, {eid: 85080907099, doi: 10.1007/s10479-020-03556-1}>, <Estimating the effects of light rail transit (LRT) system on residential property values using geographically weighted regression (GWR), {eid: 85027920069, doi: 10.1007/s12061-014-9117-z}>, <None, {eid: 85101874404}>, <None, {eid: 85101868105}>, <None, {eid: 85101873751}>, <None, {eid: 85101876630}>, <Developing a spatial planning information package in ISO 19152 land administration domain model, {eid: 85091261382, doi: 10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104111}>, <None, {eid: 85101878455}>, <International Valuation Standards, {eid: 85046661939, doi: 10.1002/9781118329795}>, <A review of property mass valuation models, {eid: 84855473892}>, <None, {eid: 85101884553}>, <None, {eid: 85101875496}>, <None, {eid: 85101875632}>, <3 Dimensional data research for property valuation in the context of the LADM valuation information model, {eid: 85090872147, doi: 10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104179}>, <Use of multicriteria valuation of spatial units in a system of mass real estate valuation, {eid: 84866236940}>, <The land administration domain model, {eid: 84949104218, doi: 10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.01.014}>, <None, {eid: 85101870154}>, <Analysis of possibilities for linking land registers and other official registers in the Republic of Croatia based on LADM, {eid: 84948978633, doi: 10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.10.025}>, <Valuation of agricultural land fragmentation, {eid: 85036642037}>, <None, {eid: 85101874176}>, <None, {eid: 85101876601}>, <Land Information Administration: Cadastre (In Croatian.), {eid: 85044469341}>, <None, {eid: 85101867025}>, <None, {eid: 85101880914}>, <None, {eid: 85101884413}>, <None, {eid: 85101875180}>, <None, {eid: 85101869148}>, <None, {eid: 85101880146}>, <A Conceptual Model for Developing Interoperability Specifications in Spatial Data Infrastructures, {eid: 84875012697}>, <Land Administration Guidelines, {eid: 0003476966}>, <None, {eid: 85101872605}>, <None, {eid: 85101883577}>, <None, {eid: 85101878608}>, <None, {eid: 85101887335}>, <None, {eid: 85101874853}>, <Examination of compatibility between the Croatian Land Administration System and LADM, {eid: 84948945715, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-36379-5}>, <Overview of the Croatian Land Administration System and the possibilities for its upgrade to 3D by existing data, {eid: 85026388681, doi: 10.3390/ijgi6070223}>, <Bus stop, property price and land value tax: a multilevel hedonic analysis with quantile calibration, {eid: 84907310839, doi: 10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.07.017}>, <Towards a valuation and taxation information model for Chinese rural collective construction land, {eid: 85076489448, doi: 10.3390/su11236610}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,5/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85101872569

This paper presents a compact review about digital twins for PED from aspects of concepts, working principles, tools/platforms, and applications, in order to address the issues of both how a digital PED twin is made and what tools can be used for a digital PED twin. Four key components of digital PED twin are identified, i.e., a virtual model, sensor network integration, data analytics, and a stakeholder layer. Very few available tools now have full functions for digital PED twin, while most tools either have a focus on industrial applications or are designed for data collection, communication and visualization based on building information models (BIM) or geographical information system (GIS). Several observations gained from successful application are that current digital PED twins can be categorized into three tiers: (1) an enhanced version of BIM model only, (2) semantic platforms for data flow, and (3) big data analysis and feedback operation. Further challenges and opportunities are found in areas of data analysis and semantic interoperability, business models, data security, and management. The outcome of the review is expected to provide useful information for further development of digital PED twins and optimizing its sustainability.","application, digital twin, positive energy district, review, simulation tool",,,,,,,,"<Data security, privacy, availability and integrity in cloud computing: issues and current solutions, {eid: 85019206410, doi: 10.14569/IJACSA.2016.070464}>, <SPHERE: BIM digital twin platform, {eid: 85081081915, doi: 10.3390/proceedings2019020009}>, <A survey on data confidentiality and privacy in cloud computing, {eid: 85030468877, doi: 10.1145/3102304.3102314}>, <Modeling of data security in cloud computing, {eid: 84979238831, doi: 10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490658}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <None, {eid: 85123065556}>, <Data security and privacy protection issues in cloud computing, {eid: 84861072527, doi: 10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.193}>, <None, {eid: 85123086519}>, <None, {eid: 85123062640}>, <None, {eid: 85123103896}>, <None, {eid: 85123110758}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <An approach to data acquisition for urban building energy modeling using a gaussian mixture model and expectation-maximization algorithm, {eid: 85099990916, doi: 10.3390/buildings11010030}>, <None, {eid: 85123082674}>, <Towards the next generation of smart grids: semantic and holonic multiagent management of distributed energy resources, {eid: 85017566936, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.107}>, <None, {eid: 85123104373}>, <None, {eid: 85123078152}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 84968669593}>, <Fair P2P energy trading between residential and commercial multi-energy systems enabling integrated demand-side management, {eid: 85078962304, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114551}>, <Digital twin: vision, benefits, boundaries, and creation for buildings, {eid: 85077738936, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946515}>, <None, {eid: 85077118399, doi: 10.1145/3359997.3365734}>, <None, {eid: 85104498118}>, <None, {eid: 85123074391}>, <None, {eid: 85123064251}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <None, {eid: 85111421396}>, <None, {eid: 85123088972}>, <None, {eid: 85123086618}>, <Enabling technologies and tools for digital twin, {eid: 85074335396, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2019.10.001}>, <Selection of energy performance contracting business models: a behavioral decision-making approach, {eid: 85009468569, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.058}>, <Data security challenges and its solutions in cloud computing, {eid: 84938915179, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.171}>, <None, {eid: 85123081657}>, <Business model innovation for sustainable energy: German utilities and renewable energy, {eid: 84884983829, doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.038}>, <A comparison of arrangements for increasing self-consumption and maximising the value of distributed photovoltaics on apartment buildings, {eid: 85072750095, doi: 10.1016/j.solener.2019.09.067}>, <None, {eid: 85082387061}>, <None, {eid: 85085171158}>, <None, {eid: 85097752653}>, <None, {eid: 85123092752}>, <None, {eid: 85123071433}>, <None, {eid: 85112079295}>, <None, {eid: 85123092089}>, <None, {eid: 85123091342}>, <Peer-to-peer energy trading in a microgrid, {eid: 85044466952, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.010}>",,,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,6/21/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85115005557

In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of the FAIM 2021.Cyber-physical security has been taken more seriously recently in manufacturing systems because of highly increasing integration of cyber and network systems with physical production known as cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS). This paper presents a novel proactive approach to forecast the interrelation of attackers and cyber-physical manufacturing systems to suggest a proper defense strategy to the system managerial. In this research, the zero-sum game payoff function developed in our previous studies is transformed into an epistemic type Bayesian game that addresses uncertainties on types of players. The risk preference behavior also is considered as a characteristic of different types of players and to form the Bayesian utility function. Finally, a numerical example is analyzed with a structured method by developing the Bayesian game, computing Bayes-Nash equilibria, and finding quantal response equilibrium.

In healthcare, I-CPS enables the intelligent wearable devices to gather data from the real-world and transmit to the virtual world for decision-making. I-CPS makes our lives comfortable with the emergence of innovative healthcare applications. Similar to any other IIoT paradigm, I-CPS capable healthcare applications face numerous challenging issues. The resource-constrained nature of wearable devices and their inability to support complex security mechanisms provide an ideal platform to malevolent entities for launching attacks. To preserve the privacy of wearable devices and their data in an I-CPS environment, in this article we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model that uses symmetric encryption for establishing secured sessions among the communicating entities. After mutual authentication, the privacy risk associated with a patient data is predicted using an AI-enabled hidden Markov model. We analyzed the robustness and security of our scheme using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. This analysis shows that the use of lightweight security primitives for the exchange of session keys makes the proposed scheme highly resilient in terms of security, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, the proposed scheme incurs nominal overhead in terms of processing, communication and storage and is capable to combat a wide range of adversarial threats.","Artificial intelligence (AI), authentication, client-server model, industrial cyber-physical systems (I-CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), privacy, security",,,,,,,,"<Next-generation big data analytics: State of the art, challenges, and future research topics, {eid: 85019731149}>, <Privacy-preserving data integrity verification by using lightweight streaming authenticated data structures for healthcare cyber-physical system, {eid: 85046370453}>, <Context-sensitive access in industrial internet of things (IIoT) healthcare applications, {eid: 85042384639}>, <Privacyprotector: Privacy-protected patient data collection in IoT-based healthcare systems, {eid: 85042190860}>, <Secured data collection with hardware-based ciphers for IoT-based healthcare, {eid: 85049792907}>, <A lightweight anonymous user authentication and key establishment scheme for wearable devices, {eid: 85056888201}>, <A realistic lightweight anonymous authentication protocol for securing real-time application data access in wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84994469267}>, <Cloud centric authentication for wearable healthcare monitoring system, {eid: 85045756993}>, <A provably secure, efficient, and flexible authentication scheme for ad hoc wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84962198336}>, <End-to-end security scheme for mobility enabled healthcare Internet of Things, {eid: 84961223694}>, <Certificateless remote anonymous authentication schemes forwirelessbody area networks, {eid: 84891804845}>, <Design of secure and lightweight authentication protocol for wearable devices environment, {eid: 85030632828}>, <The random oracle methodology, revisited, {eid: 4243180376}>, <A logic of authentication, {eid: 0000523051}>, <Privacy-preserving scoring of tree ensembles:Anovel framework for ai in healthcare, {eid: 85062592145}>, <Ai in healthcare: Ethical and privacy challenges, {eid: 85068346761}>, <Modelchain: Decentralized privacypreserving healthcare predictive modeling framework on private blockchain networks, {eid: 85048289322}>, <A fast CP-ABE system for cyber-physical security and privacy in mobile healthcare network, {eid: 85086994476}>, <Functional correctness proofs of encryption algorithms, {eid: 33745433697}>, <Incognito: A method for obfuscating web data, {eid: 85075033657}>, <PPFA: Privacy preserving fog-enabled aggregation in smart grid, {eid: 85041516118}>, <Chaotic map-based anonymous user authentication scheme with user biometrics and fuzzy extractor for crowdsourcing Internet of Things, {eid: 85054018028}>, <Anonymous mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for wearable sensors inwireless body area networks, {eid: 85016030664}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,8/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85097943880

However, several challenges including efficiency, timeliness, and safety still exist in AGVs system in discrete manufacturing shopfloor. To address these challenges, a self-adaptive traffic control model combining behavior trees (BTs) and reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to implement optimal decisions according to diverse, dynamic and complex situations in Industry 4.0 environments. A cyber-physical systems using multiagent system technology is designed in which components such as AGVs and traffic commander are defined as specific agent that cooperates autonomously with each other. Then, the behavior construction model is constructed by BTs to enumerate all the possible states in AGVs traffic control. An RL model is further developed based on the BTs. By using this approach, in this article, AGVs have the ability to adaptively choose the optimal rule-based strategy from existing optional strategies. The case study of the scenario avoiding collisions at intersections illustrates that the proposed model can enhance self-adaptive capability of AGVs traffic control and simultaneously guarantees efficiency, timeliness, and safety.","Automated guided vehicle (AGV), behavior trees (BTs), Industrial 4.0, reinforcement learning (RL), self-adaptive control",,,,,,,,"<Data-driven sustainable intelligent manufacturing based on demand response for energy-intensive industries, {eid: 85088900199}>, <A decision support system for fuzzy multi-attribute selection of material handling equipments, {eid: 22144491205}>, <Decentralized autonomous AGV system for material handling, {eid: 0037109624}>, <An optimization method for shopfloor material handling based on real-time and multi-source manufacturing data, {eid: 84929502166}>, <A radio frequency identification based optimal material delivery method for digital plant production, {eid: 79957483556}>, <CPS-based smart control model for shopfloor material handling, {eid: 85031778396}>, <A cooperative control modelformultiagent-basedmaterialhandlingsystems, {eid: 53849129937}>, <Reinforcement learning: A survey, {eid: 0029679044}>, <Data-driven flotation industrial process operational optimal control based on reinforcement learning, {eid: 85031899344}>, <Decoupled visual servoing with fuzzy Q-Learning, {eid: 85040669019}>, <Motion segmentation and balancing for a biped robots imitation learning, {eid: 85020626163}>, <Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 84924051598}>, <Mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree search, {eid: 84963949906}>, <Smart agents in industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84977992593}>, <Modeling multi-cellular behavior in epidermal tissue homeostasis via finite state machines in multiagent systems, {eid: 68549140311}>, <Agent and cyber-physical system based self-organizing and self-adaptive intelligent shopfloor, {eid: 85014892131}>, <Simulation-based optimisation of logistics distribution system for an assembly line with path constraints, {eid: 84898028834}>, <An ant colony algorithm (ACA) for solving the new integrated model of job shop scheduling and conflict-free routing of AGVs, {eid: 84952864376}>, <Survey of research in the design and control of automated guided vehicle systems, {eid: 27744600972}>, <Application of AI to AGV control-Agent control of AGVs, {eid: 0035836310}>, <A design for a tandem AGVS with multi-load AGVs, {eid: 0347504541}>, <Dynamic-zone strategy for vehicle-collision prevention and load balancing in an AGV system with a single-loop guide path, {eid: 0033729519}>, <The dynamic window approach to collision avoidance, {eid: 0031098777}>, <Anti-collision method for AGV using RFID and zigbee network, {eid: 84893577223}>, <Behavior trees for evolutionary robotics, {eid: 84958949972}>, <Robot soccer control using behaviour trees and fuzzy logic, {eid: 84999635830}>, <Trained behavior trees: Programming by demonstration to support AI game designers, {eid: 85088896514}>, <Building behavior trees from observations in real-time strategy games, {eid: 84969217062}>, <The GPU computing era, {eid: 77951154340}>, <Deep learning, {eid: 84930630277}>, <An adaptive decision-making method with fuzzy Bayesian reinforcement learning for robot soccer, {eid: 85041465903}>, <Evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent learning: A survey, {eid: 84940397349}>, <Q-learning, {eid: 34249833101}>, <Real-time scheduling for a smart factory using a reinforcement learning approach, {eid: 85044791956}>, <Behavior trees: From systems engineering to software engineering, {eid: 78650494936}>, <Decentralized motion planning and scheduling of AGVs in an FMS, {eid: 85030787755}>, <Study of SOM-based intelligent multi-controller for real-time scheduling, {eid: 80053570821}>, <None, {eid: 85091509540}>, <None, {eid: 85088323858}>, <Hierarchical Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, {eid: 85027940635}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,12/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85100915241

Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.","Attack Patterns, CVSS, Cybersecurity pillars, IIoT, Industrial Internet of Things, Industrial Security, Information Technologies, Operational Technologies, Risk

In this tutorial, we explain the fundamental elements of blockchains. We discuss their ability to achieve availability, consistency, and data integrity as well as their inherent limitations. Using Ethereum as a case study, we describe the inner workings of blockchains in detail before comparing blockchains to traditional distributed systems. In the second part of our tutorial, we discuss the major challenges facing blockchains and summarize ongoing research and commercial offerings that seek to address these challenges.","Blockchain,

After an examination of applicability of the classical and extended classification of power system stability by IEEE/Cigre, a new classification framework was finally proposed to get with the new scenario of ""double high"", while maintaining the classical logic of classification. Hopefully, this work helps to promote the researches on modeling, analysis and control of the stability of ""double high"" power systems.","Classification, Power electronics, Power system stability, Renewable energy",,,,,,,,"<Impact of high penetration of renewable resources on power system transient stability, {eid: 85079031059}>, <Renewables 2020 global status report, {eid: 85090503548}>, <World wind power generation development in 2000, {eid: 85101081781}>, <None, {eid: 85101060872}>, <None, {eid: 85101103468}>, <None, {eid: 85101169124}>, <None, {eid: 85101154220}>, <Multi-time scale voltage and power angle dynamics in power electronics dominated large power systems, {eid: 84991740196}>, <Power electronics, smart grid, and renewable energy systemsJ, {eid: 85030787585}>, <Multi-time scale transients in power-electronized power systems considering multi-time scale switching control schemes of power electronics apparatus, {eid: 85074891621}>, <Global wind energy outlook 2016, {eid: 79951517694}>, <Technology roadmap-solar photovoltaic energy, 2014, {eid: 78751509103}>, <China renewable energy outlook 2019, {eid: 85101131934}>, <None, {eid: 85101164362}>, <Technology features of the new generation power system in China, {eid: 85051245830}>, <Comparison of the grid support capability of DFIG-based wind farms and conventional power plants with synchronous generators, {eid: 71849092708}>, <Study on technical bottleneck of new energy development, {eid: 85018777877}>, <Framework of problems in large scale wind integration, {eid: 84897126368}>, <Key scientific issues and theoretical research framework for power systems with high proportion of renewable energy, {eid: 85021001702}>, <The impact of power electronics interfaces on power system frequency control: a review, {eid: 85074953109}>, <Power systems with high renewable energy sources: a review of inertia and frequency control strategies over time, {eid: 85071919439}>, <Stability definitions and characterization of dynamic behavior in systems with high penetration of power electronic interfaced technologies, {eid: 85089553256}>, <Comparison of short-circuit current contribution of Doubly-fed induction generator based wind turbines and synchronous generator, {eid: 84890884122}>, <Practice and challenge of renewable energy development based on interconnected power grids, {eid: 85035144735}>, <GB 38755-2019 Code on security and stability for power system, {eid: 85091210618}>, <Effects of increasing power electronics on system stability: results from MIGRATE questionnaire, {eid: 85062832628}>, <Studies on the stability issues about large scale wind farm grid integration, {eid: 77951475532}>, <Definition and classification of power system stability IEEE/CIGRE joint task force on stability terms and definitions, {eid: 4043101022}>, <System stability impact of large-scale and distributed solar photovoltaic generation: the case of Ontario, Canada, {eid: 84880272691}>, <Small-signal stability of wind power system with full-load converter interfaced wind turbines, {eid: 84866665828}>, <Effect of variable speed wind turbine generator on stability of a weak grid, {eid: 33947625133}>, <Impact of grid connection of large-scale wind farms on power system small-signal angular stability, {eid: 84971240476}>, <Assessment and enhancement of small signal stability of a renewable-energy-based electricity distribution system, {eid: 84883251233}>, <Voltage and transient stability support by wind farms complying with the E.

The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.","architecture, car-as-a-service, Digital twin, granularity, industry 4.0, model",,,,,,,,"<Intelligent manufacturing in the context of industry 4.0: A review, {eid: 85040743821}>, <Digital twin as a service (DTaaS) in industry 4.0: An architecture reference model, {eid: 85097743225}>, <Towards architecting digital twinpervaded systems, {eid: 85074976546}>, <Digital twin: Current scenario and a case study on a manufacturing process, {eid: 85084031553}>, <Digital twin in the IoT context: A survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models, {eid: 85087488936}>, <Process modeling for industry 4.0 applications: Towards an industry 4.0 process modeling language and method, {eid: 85006846896}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <ISO Automation systems and integration digital twin framework for manufacturing, {eid: 85126168283}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Modeling, simulation, information technology & processing roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Internet of things ontology for digital twin in cyber physical systems, {eid: 85065093309}>, <Dynamic modeling of manufacturing equipment capability using condition information in cloud manufacturing, {eid: 84936971877}>, <Modeling of digital twin workshop based on perception data, {eid: 85028357999}>, <A reconfigurable modeling approach for digital twin-based manufacturing system, {eid: 85070557472}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <An open source approach to the design and implementation of digital twins for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85064532610}>, <A centralized support infrastructure (CSI) to manage CPS digital twin, towards the synchronization between CPS deployed on the shopfloor and their digital representation, {eid: 85076290432}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Automatic assembly planning based on digital product descriptions, {eid: 85041407539}>, <Plug-And-simulate within modular assembly line enabled by digital twins and the use of automationml, {eid: 85044297204}>, <Information modeling for cyber-physical production system based on digital twin and automationml, {eid: 85081887346}>, <Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model, {eid: 85076833589}>, <A six-layer architecture for the digital twin: A manufacturing case study implementation, {eid: 85089250665}>, <A digital twin based industrial automation and control system security architecture, {eid: 85078224349}>, <A digital twin architecture based on the industrial internet of things technologies, {eid: 85063782240}>, <A hierarchical digital twin model framework for dynamic cyber-physical system design, {eid: 85065215650}>, <Digital factories for capability modeling and visualization, {eid: 85016059293}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>, <Digital twindriven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85042334812}>, <A novel cloud-based framework for the elderly healthcare services using digital twin, {eid: 85065103886}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <The newest road revolution: Car as a service, {eid: 85098650511}>, <None, {eid: 85088510035}>, <Car-sharing services: An annotated review, {eid: 85038035266}>, <Shared mobility as a driver for sustainable consumptions: The intention to re-use free-floating car sharing, {eid: 85068877803}>, <Access-based consumption: The case of car sharing, {eid: 84869745851}>, <A comprehensive survey of driving monitoring and assistance systems, {eid: 85067538694}>, <A six-layer digital twin architecture for a manufacturing cell, {eid: 85059060745}>, <None, {eid: 85033731937}>, <Integration of digital twin and deep learning in cyber-physical systems: Towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85088873643}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770}>, <A methodology for digital twin modeling and deployment for industry 4.0, {eid: 85098780861}>, <A standard-based open source IoT platform: Fiware, {eid: 85086591264}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,1/1/2022,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85121355175

The creation of a smart city is closely associated with upgrading the construction industry to encompass many emerging concepts and technologies, such as Construction 4.0, with its roots in Industry 4.0, and the deployment of building information modeling (BIM) as an essential tool for the construction industry. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the current state of the art and development trajectory of the multidisciplinary integration of Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0, BIM, and sustainable construction in the context of the smart city. It is the first attempt in the literature to use both macro-quantitative analysis and micro-qualitative analysis methods to investigate this multidisciplinary research topic. By using the visual bibliometric tool, VOSviewer, and based on macro keyword co-occurrence, this paper is the first to reveal the five keyword-constructed schemes, research hotspots, and development trends of the smart city, Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0, BIM, and sustainable construction, from 2014 to 2021 (a period of eight years). Additionally, the top 11 productive subject areas have been identified with the help of VOSviewer software keyword-clustering analysis and application. Furthermore, the whole-building life cycle is considered as an aid to identifying research gaps and trends, providing suggestions for future research with the assistance of an upgraded version of BIM, namely, city information modeling (CIM) and the future integration of Industry 5.0 and Construction 5.0, or even of Industry Metaverse with Construction Metaverse.","bibliometric, building information modeling (BIM), Construction 4.0, Construction Metaverse, Industry 4.0, keyword co-occurrence, life cycle stage, smart city, sustainable building, visualization, VOSviewer",,,,,,,,"<Towards Sustainable Smart Cities: A Review of Trends, Architectures, Components, and Open Challenges in Smart Cities, {eid: 85041485794, doi: 10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.053}>, <None, {eid: 0003530702}>, <Current Trends in Smart City Initiatives: Some Stylised Facts, {eid: 84892634029, doi: 10.1016/j.cities.2013.12.010}>, <A Unified Definition of a Smart City, {eid: 85048547312}>, <Searching for Smart City Definition: A Comprehensive Proposal, {eid: 84939971487, doi: 10.24297/ijct.v11i5.1142}>, <Efficient Energy Management for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities, {eid: 85009989690, doi: 10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600218CM}>, <Everything You Wanted to Know about Smart Cities: The Internet of Things Is the Backbone, {eid: 84983385301, doi: 10.1109/MCE.2016.2556879}>, <Can Cities Become Smart without Being Sustainable?

Further, IoT systems increasingly demand the resilient operability of services, as they become part of critical infrastructures. This leads to a broad variety of research works that aim to increase the resilience of these systems. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making IoT systems resilient. In particular, we first discuss the taxonomy and classification of resilience and resilience mechanisms and subsequently survey state-of-the-art resilience mechanisms that have been proposed by research work and are applicable to IoT. As part of the survey, we also discuss questions that focus on the practical aspects of resilience, e.g., which constraints resilience mechanisms impose on developers when designing resilient systems by incorporating a specific mechanism into IoT systems.","dependability, Internet of Things, resilience, security",,,,,,,,"<A resilient internet of things architecture for smart cities, {eid: 84975127016}>, <The cloud application modelling and execution language, {eid: 85075664856}>, <Blockchain-based smart-iot trust zone measurement architecture, {eid: 85066796089}>, <Shadow honeypots, {eid: 84910683998}>, <None, {eid: 0004048154}>, <A distilled characterization of resilience and its embraced properties based on state-spaces, {eid: 85072873722}>, <Internet of Things: Security vulnerabilities and challenges, {eid: 84961943315}>, <A supervised intrusion detection system for smart home IoT devices, {eid: 85073455917}>, <Modeling and analyzing MAPE-K feedback loops for self-adaptation, {eid: 84953309690}>, <The N-version approach to fault-tolerant software, {eid: 0022252695}>, <A visit to the jungle of terminology, {eid: 85031753623}>, <None, {eid: 0004141256}>, <Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing, {eid: 12344308304}>, <Automating efficient variable-grained resiliency for low-power IoT systems, {eid: 85052762439}>, <Chameleon: A hybrid, proactive auto-scaling mechanism on a level-playing field, {eid: 85053342911}>, <ECDSA on things: IoT integrity protection in practise, {eid: 85005977709}>, <A novel honeypot based security approach for real-time intrusion detection and prevention systems, {eid: 85049025295}>, <Self-adaptation to device distribution in the internet of things, {eid: 85030239458}>, <Cyber resilience in IoT network: Methodology and example of assessment through epidemic spreading approach, {eid: 85070398242}>, <FireDeX: A prioritized IoT data exchange middleware for emergency response, {eid: 85060371184}>, <State machine replication for the masses with BFTSMaRt, {eid: 84912085288}>, <From Byzantine fault tolerance to intrusion tolerance (a position paper), {eid: 80052157228}>, <Resilience is more than availability, {eid: 84855681890}>, <HADES-IoT: A practical host-based anomaly detection system for IoT devices, {eid: 85069961553}>, <None, {eid: 77957941325}>, <The primary-backup approach, {eid: 0001556566}>, <Practical Byzantine fault tolerance, {eid: 0001038609}>, <Soteria: Automated IoT safety and security analysis, {eid: 85077468095}>, <Verifying internet of things safety and security in physical spaces, {eid: 85067055097}>, <Bringing the cloud to the edge, {eid: 84904465488}>, <N-version programming: A fault-tolerance approach to reliability of software operation, {eid: 0003052123}>, <Metrics and measurement of trustworthy systems, {eid: 85011890975}>, <Blockchains and smart contracts for the internet of things, {eid: 84979828304}>, <OnboardICNg: A secure protocol for on-boarding IoT devices in ICN, {eid: 84994082446}>, <Dependable and secure voting mechanism in edge comp, {eid: 85079620256}>, <Diversity on state machine replication, {eid: 85051068561}>, <A model for correlated failures in N-version programming, {eid: 8344241193}>, <On resilience of IoT systems: The internet of things (Ubiquity symposium), {eid: 85045955626}>, <CASCA: A design automation approach for designing hardware countermeasures against side-channel attacks, {eid: 85056373026}>, <A pattern-language for selfhealing internet-of-things systems, {eid: 85115445032}>, <None, {eid: 85058395908}>, <A ZigBee honeypot to assess IoT cyberattack behaviour, {eid: 85027862740}>, <Resilient, crowd-sourced LPWAN infrastructure using blockchain, {eid: 85051634028}>, <Towards a robust, self-organizing IoT platform for secure and dependable service execution, {eid: 85099733793}>, <A new metric to quantify resiliency in networking, {eid: 84867848116}>, <A review on the use of blockchain for the internet of things, {eid: 85047783561}>, <Fog-based secure comm.

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

The complexity of these systems leads to questions about prevalent modeling approaches, their ability to integrate heterogeneous models, and their relevance to the application domains and stakeholders. The methodology for Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) of CPS is not yet fully established and standardized, and researchers apply existing methods for modeling of complex systems and introducing their own. No systematic review has been previously performed to create an overview of the field on the methods used for MPM of CPS. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study that determines the models, formalisms, and development processes used over the last decade. Additionally, to determine the knowledge necessary for developing CPS, our review studied the background of actors involved in modeling and authors of surveyed studies. The results of the survey show a tendency to reuse multiple existing formalisms and their associated paradigms, in addition to a tendency towards applying transformations between models. These findings suggest that MPM is becoming a essential approach to model CPS, and highlight the importance of future integration of models, standardization of development process and education.","Cyber–Physical System, Development process, Formalism, Model, Modeling paradigm, Systematic review",,,,,,,,"<Using model driven engineering to support multi-paradigms security analysis, {eid: 84955284071, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-27869-8_16}>, <Industrial use cases of cyber physical systems in EU projects: Preliminary study., {eid: 85117728800}>, <State-of-the-art on Current Formalisms used in Cyber-Physical Systems Development 1201234567891-0 1: Tech. rep., {eid: 85117700093}>, <Towards a formal specification of multi-paradigm modelling, {eid: 85075937334, doi: 10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00067}>, <Multi-paradigm modelling for cyber–physical systems: a descriptive framework, {eid: 85107508780, doi: 10.1007/s10270-021-00876-z}>, <Designing safe and secure embedded and cyber-physical systems with sysml-sec, {eid: 84955298267, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-27869-8_17}>, <Design and verification of cyber-physical systems using truetime, evolutionary optimization and UPPAAL, {eid: 84969352242, doi: 10.1016/J.MICPRO.2015.12.006}>, <Ensuring safety, security, and sustainability of mission-critical cyber–physical systems, {eid: 84155165352, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2011.2165689}>, <Defining formalisms for performance evaluation with simthesys, {eid: 80055014024, doi: 10.1016/j.entcs.2011.09.004}>, <Exploiting cloudsim in a multiformalism modeling approach for cloud based systems, {eid: 85054447089}>, <Exploiting product forms solution techniques in multiformalism modeling, {eid: 84873339776, doi: 10.1016/j.entcs.2013.07.005}>, <STSM Report: Systematic literature review on multi-paradigm modeling for CPS systems, {eid: 85117726728, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1454531}>, <Usability driven DSL development with USE-ME, {eid: 85028946457, doi: 10.1016/j.cl.2017.06.005}>, <None, {eid: 85117718213}>, <Sustainability in Modelling of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review - Intermediate Technical Report, {eid: 85117688496, doi: 10.5281/ZENODO.1481946}>, <Systematic Literature Review on Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems: Tech.

In CPS, large number of IoT devices (sensors, actuators, etc.) are deployed to collect data to support safety critical smart-world CPS infrastructures such as smart city, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart transportation. The degradation of physical components of safety critical smart-world CPSs would deteriorate the performance of the smart system and lead to loss of human life with significant damage to properties. Hence, planned preventive maintenance replacement of physical components of the system is vital to extend the lifetime of the system, to reduce maintenance cost and to avoid risks that may cause major harm to life and property. In this study, we focus on cost effective preventive replacement strategy that recovers failure of physical components of safety critical smart-world CPSs by mainly considering the deterioration state of the physical component on the availability of the system. In view of the degraded physical component of CPSs, we demonstrate the effects of involving maintenance actions during the deterioration state of physical components of CPSs on its availability. Since timely preventive replacement is crucial to support continuous and effective system operation, we compute the optimum time of the constant-interval of preventive replacement strategy for the physical components of CPSs. In this study, we use Weibull distribution as it is a generalized failure model that has been widely used for process equipment life data analyses. At last, the effects of the shape and the scale parameters on the optimal preventive replacement interval of the physical component are also demonstrated.","Availability, IoT, Preventive maintenance, Safety critical smart-world CPS, Weibull distribution",,,,,,,,"<The new Weibull handbook, 2nd edn, {eid: 85103254300}>, <Cyber physical systems role in manufacturing technologies, {eid: 85046118545, doi: 10.1063/1.5034337}>, <Dependability analysis of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85033466417, doi: 10.1049/iet-cdt.2016.0164}>, <Optimum preventive replacement interval for the physical component of cyber physical systems, {eid: 85103269365}>, <A review of the Weibull distribution, {eid: 0000859680, doi: 10.1080/00224065.1993.11979431}>, <Optimal replacement policy under a general failure and repair model: minimal versus worse than old repair, {eid: 85052125046, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2018.07.032}>, <Optimal preventive maintenance policies, {eid: 0002362385, doi: 10.1287/opre.8.1.90}>, <ICT Agriculture support system for chili pepper harvesting, {eid: 85088264692}>, <Optimization of dynamic preventive maintenance for multicomponent systems, {eid: 85067874407}>, <Optimal spare ordering policy for preventive replacement under cost effective-ness criterion, {eid: 70350354678, doi: 10.1016/j.apm.2009.06.017}>, <Reliability variation and optimal age replacement schedule of compensated discrete multi-state systems, {eid: 85066603727}>, <A multi-stage imperfect maintenance strategy for multi-state systems with variable user demands, {eid: 85084576349, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2020.106508Accessed29June2020}>, <The present status of maintenance strategies and the impact of maintenance on reliability, {eid: 0035505636, doi: 10.1109/59.962408}>, <An integrated logistics model of spare parts maintenance planning within the aviation industry, {eid: 84892417708}>, <Emerging technologies for sustainable smart city network security: issues, challenges, and countermeasures, {eid: 85074951546}>, <A review on maintenance optimization, {eid: 85072727242, doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2019.09.047}>, <Basic research for smart community center planning by applying the concept of CPS (Cyber-Physical System) of smart city, {eid: 85103293382}>, <A periodic maintenance model with used equipment and random minimal repair, {eid: 0025539912, doi: 10.1002/1520-6750(199012)37:6<855::AID-NAV3220370605>3.0.CO;2-U}>, <None, {eid: 0003411445}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Replacement and maintenance decision analysis for hydraulic machinery facilities at reservoirs under imperfect maintenance, {eid: 85086024528, doi: 10.3390/en13102507}>, <Manufacturing system maintenance based on dynamic programming model with prognostics information, {eid: 85014002548, doi: 10.1007/s10845-017-1314-6}>, <None, {eid: 77953911961}>, <Application of dynamic reconfiguration in the design of fault-tolerant production cell, {eid: 0008537730}>, <Health and wellness monitoring using intelligent sensing technique, {eid: 85077228232}>, <None, {eid: 2142685609}>, <Generalized reliability centered maintenance modeling through modified semi-Markov chain in power system, {eid: 84863011635, doi: 10.5370/JEET.2011.6.1.025}>, <S-mote: SMART home framework for common household appliances in IoT network, {eid: 85065072484}>, <None, {eid: 0003752181}>, <Decision mapping and optimal inspection models for plant maintenance: some case studies, {eid: 84890880899}>, <Periodic replacement strategy: optimality conditions and numerical performance comparisons, {eid: 85023164173, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2017.1349953}>, <A repair and replacement policy for repairable systems based on probability and mean of profits, {eid: 85056943510, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2018.11.012}>, <Integrated production and maintenance planning in cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85065396080, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2019.02.095}>, <The generalized age maintenance policies with random working times, {eid: 85031039569, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2017.09.003}>, <A Study on the development and effect of smart manufacturing system in PCB Line, {eid: 85065075156}>, <Preventive and corrective maintenance–cost comparison and cost–benefit analysis, {eid: 84957845906, doi: 10.1080/15732479.2015.1032983}>, <Adjusting Markov models to changes in maintenance policy for reliability analysis, {eid: 85015188370}>, <A combined structural and dynamic modelling approach for dependability analysis in smart grid, {eid: 84877963216}>, <Reliability variation of multi-state components with inertial effect of deteriorating output performances, {eid: 85062569408, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2019.02.018}>, <A two-phase preventive maintenance policy considering imperfect repair and postponed replacement, {eid: 85056719241, doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2018.10.049}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/1/2022,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85103271677

In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in enabling artificial intelligence technologies, such as advanced machine learning, new threats, such as adversarial attacks, and certification challenges, due to the lack of sufficient explainability. However, in order to be trustworthy, those systems also need to be dependable, secure, and resilient according to well-established taxonomies, methodologies, and tools. Therefore, several aspects need to be addressed for TAS, ranging from proper taxonomic classification to the identification of research opportunities and challenges. Given such a context, in this paper address relevant taxonomies and research perspectives in the field of TAS.

Based on the main characteristics of DT, five performance indices for maturity evaluation of DT projects were proposed. By reviewing the history of power system simulation tools, reasons why the power system could not breed the concept of DT were discussed, and differences between DT and traditional power system simulation were concluded. On this basis, both direction and enabling fields of DT in power systems were predicted. Following this, several main construction techniques of DT were also introduced. Finally, a case study on the heat pump switching control based on DT of the heating system was conducted, which aimed to show the basic characteristics of DT, and to illustrate the proposed maturity evaluation method.","Digital twin, Maturity evaluation, New power system",,,,,,,,"<Theory of digital twin modeling and its application, {eid: 85100967892}>, <Digital twin: manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <DRAFT modeling, simulation, information technology & processing roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <Digital twin workshop: a new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <Five-dimension digital twin model and its ten applications, {eid: 85064443425}>, <A systematic review of a digital twin city: a new pattern of urban governance toward smart cities, {eid: 85103699862}>, <An ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework for health and well-being in smart cities, {eid: 85086741550}>, <Human digital twin for fitness management, {eid: 85081154665}>, <Introducing digital twins to agriculture, {eid: 85102421457}>, <Opportunities and challenges of the digital twin in power system applications, {eid: 85086633400}>, <When smart grid meets digital twin, {eid: 85124799517}>, <Digital twin technology for smart power generation and its application modes, {eid: 85151135156}>, <Application status and development prospects of digital twin technology in condition assessment of power transmission and transformation equipment, {eid: 85107428869}>, <Digital twin of the energy internet and its application, {eid: 85170566694}>, <Framework design and application prospect for digital twins system of energy internet, {eid: 85112775217}>, <Real-time online analysis of power grid, {eid: 85091591739}>, <Application of digital twin assistant-system in state estimation for inverter dominated grid, {eid: 85095575749}>, <Multi agent coordinated optimal control strategy for smart microgrid based on digital twin drive, {eid: 85107597542}>, <A digital twin approach for fault diagnosis in distributed photovoltaic systems, {eid: 85074215768}>, <On the implementation of Iot-based digital twin for networked microgrids resiliency against cyber attacks, {eid: 85094810910}>, <Pilot protection of flexible DC grid based on digital twin, {eid: 85124804803, doi: 10.13334/j.0258-8013.pcsee.202045}>, <For a digital twin of the grid: Siemens solution enables a single digital grid model of the Finnish power system, {eid: 85064141464}>, <Analytic engine for the digital power plant, {eid: 85086269269}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Virtually intelligent product systems: digital and physical twins, {eid: 85075725280}>, <Digital twin: transform your operations with data-driven and simulation-based digital twin software, {eid: 85124787315}>, <Cold thinking about digital twin and modeling and simulation techniques behind it, {eid: 85106371818}>, <Discussing digital twin from of modeling and simulation, {eid: 85106363686}>, <Digital twins: the convergence of multimedia technologies, {eid: 85051272175}>, <Customer experience challenges: bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twins for iot applications, {eid: 85124793650}>, <Digital power system, {eid: 0001550337}>",,,Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering,,,1/20/2022,,,,,,,chi,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85124807412

The high participation of each stakeholder in this type of product production places a higher requirement on sufficient collaboration among social, cyber and physical spaces. However, under a decentralised social manufacturing network, the management of SMRs has encountered some real-life challenges in terms of their distributed and heterogeneous features. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform (BcDTCP) as an integrated solution to address these challenges. A hybrid domain-driven design method is presented to design and implement business-knowledge driven systems. To address the heterogeneity of SMRs, a ubiquitous object structure is designed to flexibly adjust the functionality of the digital twin. Blockchain is introduced to construct a peer-to-peer network to organise the SMRs in a decentralised manner. Additionally, a timed coloured Petri net-based workflow is adopted to formulise the collaboration logic into a smart contract executed on the blockchain. Finally, a demonstrative case study is conducted to verify and evaluate the proposed BcDTCP under a 3D printing scenario.","Blockchain, digital twin, domain driven design, resource collaboration,

Limited research exists on this digital transformation, and this article aims to narrow this gap through an empirical case study. In Finland, there is an ongoing transition towards information model (IM)-based planning, driven by public government development programs. Its principal focus is to achieve national-level interoperability of plan data. A harmonized IM for local master and detailed plans has recently been developed for use in municipal urban planning in the future. In addition, a national information system (IS) for built environment data is currently being developed. In this article, the perspectives of Finnish urban planners towards the national IM and IM-based planning were examined through a questionnaire. The results indicate that IM-based planning has a strong impact not only on planning outcomes (i.e., land use plans) but also on the planning context (e.g., planning practices and the planners themselves, software and information systems (ISs), and planning law). We argue that the high expectations set for IM-based planning will not be met without paying attention to the viewpoints of planners, planning practices, and the changes to planning culture in a wider sense. In addition to the technological aspects, the focus should also be on the social and contextual elements of planning.","Digital transformation, IM, Information model, Interoperability, Plan data, Planning culture, Urban planning",,,,,,,,"<Urban planning 2.0, {eid: 84898135053}>, <The digital transformation of planning, {eid: 85106909033, doi: 10.1177/23998083211016122}>, <A ‘planning revolution’ or an ‘attack on planning’ in england: Digitization, digitalization, and democratization, {eid: 85115836996, doi: 10.1080/13563475.2021.1979942}>, <Engaging the wisdom of crowds and public judgment for land use planning using public participation geographic information systems, {eid: 84941806482}>, <Interoperability Platform, {eid: 85144777553}>, <Ympäristöministeriö hyödyntää Yhteentoimivuusalustaa rakennetun ympäristön tiedonhallinnassa, {eid: 85144767348}>, <DIGIPLAN – five Thematic Practice Papers on digital plans and plan data, {eid: 85144793641}>, <DIGIPLAN – synthesis report.

Some of this research is helping to solve humankind’s most pressing problems. However, as this provocation argues, up to 50% of the articles that are now being published in many interdisciplinary sustainability and transitions journals may be categorized as “scholarly bullshit.” These are articles that typically engage with the latest sustainability and transitions buzzword (e.g., circular economy), while contributing little to none to the scholarly body of knowledge on the topic. A typology of “scholarly bullshit” is proposed which includes the following archetypes: boring question scholarship, literature review of literature reviews, recycled research, master thesis madness, and activist rants. Since “scholarly bullshit” articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors. Citations matter most in the metric-driven logic of the academic system, and this type of scholarship, sadly, is thus unlikely to decrease in the coming years.","Circular economy, Scholarly bullshit, Sustainability, Sustainability transitions, Sustainable development, Theory of bullshit",,,,,,,,"<On bullshit, {eid: 3042610478}>, <None, {eid: 27744471870, doi: 10.1515/9781400826537}>, <None, {eid: 85053410623}>, <Conceptualizing the circular economy: an analysis of 114 definitions, {eid: 85029397642, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005}>",,,Springer Nature,,,3/1/2023,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85171300560

Hence, software engineering plays a critical role in enabling Society 5.0 by providing the necessary technological advances and practices to address societal issues. This paper presents a systematic mapping study that focuses on identifying the key software engineering technologies and challenges that are critical for achieving the goals of Society 5.0. The study begins with an initial set of 1646 peer-reviewed publications, from which a final set of 29 primary studies was selected through a rigorous selection process. The selected studies were subjected to meticulous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis. The primary studies identified 13 software engineering technologies that act as enablers of Society 5.0. However, the application of these technologies also comes with technical challenges. The selected primary studies identified ten software engineering open challenges that hamper the realisation of Society 5.0. The findings of this study have important implications for software engineering researchers and practitioners involved in developing sustainable smart societies. The identification of the key technologies and challenges in Society 5.0 can help guide future research and development efforts in this field.","Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, Software engineering,

During our experience with projects in the field, we noticed that standards, and in particular the ISO 23247 standard, are not completely followed. In this paper, we analyse to what extent digital twin architectures documented in the literature are aligned with the reference architecture presented in the ISO 23247 standard. We achieved this through a mixed-methods research methodology that includes the analysis of 29 digital twin architectures in the manufacturing domain resulting from a systematic literature review of 140 peer-reviewed studies, a survey with 33 respondents, and four semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews. On the basis of our findings, practitioners and researchers can reflect, discuss, and plan actions for future research and development activities.","Digital Twin, ISO 23247, Reference Architecture,

This systematic and thematic review provides a detailed analysis of I4.0-related requirements in terms of MES functionalities and an overview of MES development methods and standards because these three aspects are essential in developing MESs. The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information.

For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85077515399
