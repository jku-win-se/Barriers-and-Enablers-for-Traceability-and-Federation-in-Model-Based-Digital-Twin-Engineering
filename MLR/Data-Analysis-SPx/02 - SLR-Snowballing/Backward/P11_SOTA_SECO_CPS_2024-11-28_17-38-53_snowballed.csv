All right reserved.As an enabling technology for implementing smart manufacturing, industrial 4.0, industrial internet and smart city, digital twin has received great attention from both academics and industry, especially its industrial applications. Model is the foundation and core of digital twin theories and technologies, but the traditional three-dimension digital twin model can no longer meet the new application requirements and technology development trends. To promote the application of digital twin in more fields, a five-dimension digital twin model was put forward in authors' previous research to digital twin shop-floor. In view of the new demands on digital twin and based on the previous research, a more systematic five-dimension digital twin model was presented. Furthermore, its applications in ten fields were discussed, including satellite/space communication network, ships, vehicles, power plant, aircraft, complex equipment, stereoscopic warehouse, medical, shop-floor and smart city, which could provide theoretical and methodological references for the application of digital twin in the future.","Applications, Digital twin, Five-dimension digital twin model, Ten fields",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85126961301}>, <Digital twin workshop: a new paradigm for future workshop, {eid: 85016456422}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: a new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Theories and technologies for cyber-physical fusion in digital twin shop-floor, {eid: 85031730152}>, <Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <Digital twin and its potential application exploration, {eid: 85046337978}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85042921933, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2018.1443229}>, <Modeling of cyber-physical systems and digital twin based on edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85055031143}>, <Digital twin service towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85049560307}>, <Digital twin and big data towards smart manufacturing and industry 4.0: 360 degree comparison, {eid: 85041173790}>, <IIHub: An Industrial Internet-Of-Things Hub towards Smart Manufacturing Based on Cyber-Physical system, {eid: 85030779624}>, <Equipment energy consumption management in digital twin shop-floor: a framework and potential applications, {eid: 85048222217}>, <Data-driven smart manufacturing, {eid: 85040599054}>, <Connotation, architecture and trends of product digital twin, {eid: 85021844855}>, <Digital twin: mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex system, {eid: 85016450943}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.

This paper presents the design methodology, mathematical analysis, simulation study, and experimental validation of a digital twin approach for fault diagnosis. We develop a digital twin that estimates the measurable characteristic outputs of a PV energy conversion unit (PVECU) in real time. The PVECU constitutes a PV source and a source-level power converter. The fault diagnosis is performed by generating and evaluating an error residual vector, which is the difference between the estimated and measured outputs. A PV panel-level power converter prototype is built to demonstrate how the sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities of the converter can enable effective fault diagnosis in real time. The experimental results show detection and identification of ten different faults in the PVECU. The time to fault detection (FD) in the power converter and the electrical sensors is less than 290 μs and the identification time is less than 4 ms. The time to FD and identification in the PV panel are less than 80 ms and 1.2 s, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates higher fault sensitivity than that of existing approaches. It can diagnose a 20% drift in the electrical sensor gains and a 20% shading of a solar cell in the PV panel.","Converters, estimation, fault diagnosis, fault location, solar power generation",,,,,,,,"<Fault diagnosis via PV panel-integrated power electronics, {eid: 84988942953}>, <Cascaded DC-DC converter connection of photovoltaic modules, {eid: 3843069865}>, <Improved energy capture in series string photovoltaics via smart distributed power electronics, {eid: 65949099327}>, <building america case study: Photovoltaic systems with modulelevel power electronics. technology solutions for new and existing homes, energy efficiency &renewable energy (EERE), {eid: 85074191405}>, <None, {eid: 85074198863}>, <Differential power processing for increased energy production and reliability of photovoltaic systems, {eid: 84882935460}>, <Impact of distributed power electronics on the lifetime and reliability of PV systems, {eid: 85018665385}>, <Classification and comparative evaluation of PV panel-integrated DC-DC converter concepts, {eid: 84893073315}>, <Fault impacts on solar power unit reliability, {eid: 79955783982}>, <Failure modes and effect analysis of module level power electronics, {eid: 84961653984}>, <Assessment of photovoltaic module failures in the field, {eid: 85047081933}>, <None, {eid: 0003781221}>, <Fault-tolerant strategy for a photovoltaic DC-DC converter, {eid: 84880910882}>, <Photovoltaic systems reliability improvement by real-time FPGA-based switch failure diagnosis and faulttolerant DC-DC converter, {eid: 84943769930}>, <Model-based fault detection and identification for switching power converters, {eid: 84999233018}>, <Photovoltaic hot-spot detection for solar panel substrings using ac parameter characterization, {eid: 84944096315}>, <Automatic fault diagnosis in PV systems with distributed MPPT, {eid: 84884888322}>, <Fault diagnosis of photovoltaic panels using dynamic current-voltage characteristics, {eid: 84988241284}>, <PV faults: Overview, modeling, prevention, and detection techniques, {eid: 85074203240}>, <Performance and degradation analysis for long term reliability of solar photovoltaic systems: A review, {eid: 84882260617}>, <Toward reliable power electronics: Challenges, design tools, and opportunities, {eid: 84879957467}>, <Transitioning to physics-of-failure as a reliability driver in power electronics, {eid: 84930246599}>, <Condition monitoring for device reliability in power electronic converters:Areview, {eid: 79952599891}>, <None, {eid: 85074207263}>, <None, {eid: 85074191099}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and U.S. air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <High efficiency wide load range buck/boost/bridge photovoltaic microconverter, {eid: 79955755269}>, <None, {eid: 0004107121}>, <Comprehensive approach to modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays, {eid: 67349141404}>, <Modelling power output in photovoltaic modules for outdoor operating conditions, {eid: 33646437532}>, <Potential-induced degradation in photovoltaic modules: A critical review, {eid: 85009975869}>, <FPGA-based real-time power converter failure diagnosis for wind energy conversion systems, {eid: 57749193475}>, <State observer-based sensor fault detection and isolation, and fault tolerant control of a singlephase PWM rectifier for electric railway traction, {eid: 84879110850}>, <Fault diagnosis of PWM DC-DC converters based on magnetic component voltages equation, {eid: 84900421175}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,1/1/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85074215768

By simplifying the mathematical mechanism model of the VSG, a data-driven model based on LSTM is constructed to focus on the data mapping relationship between various electrical quantities and to realize dynamic modeling of predicting the output of the next moment from the electrical quantities of current moment. A comparison between the data-driven model and theoretical method is performed to verify effectiveness of the proposed model, and the effects of different neural networks are compared. Simulation results show that the proposed model can reflect the dynamic characteristics of the VSG under different operating conditions with good stability and generalization, providing an effective solution idea for power-electronized modeling.","Data-driven, Equivalent modeling, Long- and short-term memory network, VSG",,,,,,,,"<Virtual synchronous machines and autonomous power systems, {eid: 85018263390}>, <None, {eid: 85079403662}>, <Virtual synchronous machine, {eid: 51149117207}>, <Active voltage feedback control for hybrid multiterminal HVDC system adopting improved synchronverters, {eid: 84964597305}>, <Enhanced virtual synchronous generator control for parallel inverters inmicrogrids, {eid: 84958611727}>, <A reactivepower sharing strategy of VSG based on virtual capacitoralgorithm, {eid: 85029535489}>, <Control strategy of micro grid converters with synchronous generator characteristic, {eid: 84905080213}>, <Modeling of the power loop and parameter design of virtual synchronous generators, {eid: 84955258317}>, <Virtual synchronous generator and its applications in micro-grid, {eid: 84902817520}>, <Development of power-electronized distribution grids and the new supraharmonics issues, {eid: 85047368984}>, <Small-signal impedance/admitance network modeling for grid-connected renewable energy generation systems, {eid: 85026348584}>, <Comparison and technical analysis of phasor data access modes in distribution network, {eid: 85065491759}>, <Reliability evaluation of on-line monitoring device over transmission line based on data driven concept, {eid: 85053683540}>, <Research on development strategy for smart grid big data, {eid: 84922219109}>, <Development of novel PMU device for distribution network lines, {eid: 84976273787}>, <Application of synchronized phasor measurement technology in distribution system, {eid: 85060841821}>, <Fault detection and faulted line identificationinactive distribution networks using synchrophasors-basedreal-timestate estimation, {eid: 85010378848}>, <Modeling of generator leading phase ability based on back propagation neural network, {eid: 81355141499}>, <Unified equivalent modeling of distributed generation using artificial neural network and its application in PSASP, {eid: 84968548067}>, <DC microgrid equivalent modeling based on fuzzy-RBF artificial neural network, {eid: 84994311334}>, <Review on artificial intelligence in power system transient stability analysis, {eid: 85079426501}>, <Modeling of ASVG by using diagonal recurrent neural network, {eid: 0346972281}>, <Short-term wind power forecasting based on LSTM, {eid: 85045380307}>, <Short-term load forecasting of smart grid based on long-short-term memory recurrent neural networks in condition of real-time electricity price, {eid: 85060023348}>, <Learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult, {eid: 0028392483}>, <The control strategy of virtual synchronous generator based on three-order model, {eid: 85079388714}>, <Small-signal modeling and stability analysis of current-controlled virtual synchronous generators, {eid: 85057126441}>, <Design and research on parameter of LCL filter in three-phase grid-connected inverter, {eid: 77951896283}>, <Grid background harmonic current suppression for grid-connected PWM converters, {eid: 85062923767}>, <Modeling and improved control of virtual synchronous generators under symmetrical faults of grid, {eid: 85018322693}>, <A mode estimation method for power system stochastic response considering the uncertainty, {eid: 84937622248}>",,,Power System Technology Press,,,1/5/2020,,,,,,,chi,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85079413045

Soc. for Elec. Eng.Driven by energy transition and technological progress, power system industry is undergoing a rapid development with an important trend or key feature, i. e., high penetration of renewable energy plus high penetration of power electronic equipment (namely, ""double high""), which, however, brings significant changes to the dynamic behavior of the system and causes new issues of stability. In this paper, the new features of ""double high"" power systems were summarized first. Next, their impacts on the various aspects of classical power system stability were briefly reviewed. Then, we surveyed the emerging stability issues in the context of ""double high"". After an examination of applicability of the classical and extended classification of power system stability by IEEE/Cigre, a new classification framework was finally proposed to get with the new scenario of ""double high"", while maintaining the classical logic of classification. Hopefully, this work helps to promote the researches on modeling, analysis and control of the stability of ""double high"" power systems.","Classification, Power electronics, Power system stability, Renewable energy",,,,,,,,"<Impact of high penetration of renewable resources on power system transient stability, {eid: 85079031059}>, <Renewables 2020 global status report, {eid: 85090503548}>, <World wind power generation development in 2000, {eid: 85101081781}>, <None, {eid: 85101060872}>, <None, {eid: 85101103468}>, <None, {eid: 85101169124}>, <None, {eid: 85101154220}>, <Multi-time scale voltage and power angle dynamics in power electronics dominated large power systems, {eid: 84991740196}>, <Power electronics, smart grid, and renewable energy systemsJ, {eid: 85030787585}>, <Multi-time scale transients in power-electronized power systems considering multi-time scale switching control schemes of power electronics apparatus, {eid: 85074891621}>, <Global wind energy outlook 2016, {eid: 79951517694}>, <Technology roadmap-solar photovoltaic energy, 2014, {eid: 78751509103}>, <China renewable energy outlook 2019, {eid: 85101131934}>, <None, {eid: 85101164362}>, <Technology features of the new generation power system in China, {eid: 85051245830}>, <Comparison of the grid support capability of DFIG-based wind farms and conventional power plants with synchronous generators, {eid: 71849092708}>, <Study on technical bottleneck of new energy development, {eid: 85018777877}>, <Framework of problems in large scale wind integration, {eid: 84897126368}>, <Key scientific issues and theoretical research framework for power systems with high proportion of renewable energy, {eid: 85021001702}>, <The impact of power electronics interfaces on power system frequency control: a review, {eid: 85074953109}>, <Power systems with high renewable energy sources: a review of inertia and frequency control strategies over time, {eid: 85071919439}>, <Stability definitions and characterization of dynamic behavior in systems with high penetration of power electronic interfaced technologies, {eid: 85089553256}>, <Comparison of short-circuit current contribution of Doubly-fed induction generator based wind turbines and synchronous generator, {eid: 84890884122}>, <Practice and challenge of renewable energy development based on interconnected power grids, {eid: 85035144735}>, <GB 38755-2019 Code on security and stability for power system, {eid: 85091210618}>, <Effects of increasing power electronics on system stability: results from MIGRATE questionnaire, {eid: 85062832628}>, <Studies on the stability issues about large scale wind farm grid integration, {eid: 77951475532}>, <Definition and classification of power system stability IEEE/CIGRE joint task force on stability terms and definitions, {eid: 4043101022}>, <System stability impact of large-scale and distributed solar photovoltaic generation: the case of Ontario, Canada, {eid: 84880272691}>, <Small-signal stability of wind power system with full-load converter interfaced wind turbines, {eid: 84866665828}>, <Effect of variable speed wind turbine generator on stability of a weak grid, {eid: 33947625133}>, <Impact of grid connection of large-scale wind farms on power system small-signal angular stability, {eid: 84971240476}>, <Assessment and enhancement of small signal stability of a renewable-energy-based electricity distribution system, {eid: 84883251233}>, <Voltage and transient stability support by wind farms complying with the E.

Based on the main characteristics of DT, five performance indices for maturity evaluation of DT projects were proposed. By reviewing the history of power system simulation tools, reasons why the power system could not breed the concept of DT were discussed, and differences between DT and traditional power system simulation were concluded.

Through the real-time closed-loop drive of the two-way interactive data, the real-time status and dynamic characteristics of the physical entities are simulated. As an important component in the power system, the distribution automation equipment will cause major economic losses to the power system if it fails. Based on the digital twin technology, this paper realizes the functions of information interaction, fault prediction, and early maintenance between the distribution automation terminal equipment and the distribution master station. The status evaluation comment set, the evaluation weight and the fault set are constructed and corrected in real time in the digital twin system through statistical analysis of the historical data and fault handling information collected byat the distribution automation terminals in a certain area. At the same time, an intelligent state evaluation and failure prediction model is built to provide a reference for the real-time monitoring of the state of distribution automation terminal equipment and a guidance for the distribution network operation and maintenance.","Digital twin, Distribution automation terminal equipment, Fault prediction, State evaluation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85128490219}>, <Digital twin framework and its application to power grid online analysis, {eid: 85077253897}>, <How to tell the difference between a model and a digital twin, {eid: 85081715350}>, <Research progresses and prospects on analysis and control of cyber-physical system for power grid, {eid: 85093818950}>, <Digital twin technology and its application in the integrated energy system of smart city, {eid: 85103947754}>, <None, {eid: 85128491982}>, <Design of distribution terminal auto-test system, {eid: 85067584332}>, <Parameter tuning for dynamic digital twins in inverter-dominated distribution grid, {eid: 85083448511}>, <Prospect and thinking of digital power grid based on digital twin, {eid: 85103952997}>, <A new solution architecture for online power system analysis, {eid: 85061720184}>, <A software platform for second-order responsiveness power grid online analysis, {eid: 85091590535}>, <Parallel contingency analysis for multi-CPU/Core computing environment, {eid: 85076126429}>, <Application of in-memory computing to online power grid analysis, {eid: 85058225060}>, <Analysis of online quick judgment of transient stability based on siamese network, {eid: 85061755668}>, <Opportunities and challenges of the digital twin in power system applications, {eid: 85086633400}>, <Digital twin technology and its application in petrochemical industry, {eid: 85128492848}>, <Framework design and application prospect for digital twins system of energy internet, {eid: 85112775217}>, <Ultra-short-term prediction of photovoltaic power generation based on digital twins, {eid: 85104510501}>, <Self-healing method for offline fault in distribution automation terminal unit, {eid: 85128490095}>, <Application of SimpliciTI based wireless ad-hoc network in intelligent monitoring and control system for distribution networks, {eid: 84898682093}>, <Common troubleshooting methods for distribution automation, {eid: 85128489470}>, <Comprehensive evaluation on secondary equipment condition based on matter-element extension model with variable weight, {eid: 85019715764}>, <Risk evaluation for electric power communication network based on matter-element extensible model, {eid: 85029796393}>, <Selection of PPP purchasing partner for equipment depot-level maintenance services based on triangular fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, {eid: 85128492873}>, <Design of safety early warning system for construction ships in plateau reservoir area based on triangular fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, {eid: 85128492866}>, <PV array fault diagnosis based on FCM, {eid: 84971472372}>, <Online diagnosis for combustion of power station boilers based on fuzzy C mean clustering, {eid: 85098324109}>",,,Power System Technology Press,,,4/5/2022,,,,,,,chi,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85128493248
