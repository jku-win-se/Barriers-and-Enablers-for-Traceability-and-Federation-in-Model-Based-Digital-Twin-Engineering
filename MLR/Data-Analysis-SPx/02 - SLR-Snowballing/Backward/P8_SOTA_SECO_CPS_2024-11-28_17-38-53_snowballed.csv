Currently, most existing vulnerability-assessment techniques mostly rely on only the security department due to limited communication between different working groups. This poses a limitation to the security management of CPPSs, as malicious operations may use new exploits that occur between successive analysis milestones or across departmental managerial boundaries. Thus, it is important to study and analyse CPPS networks’ security, in terms of vulnerability analysis that accounts for humans in the production process loop, to prevent potential threats to infiltrate through cross-layer gaps and to reduce the magnitude of their impact. We propose a semantic framework that supports the collaboration between different actors in the production process, to improve situation awareness for cyberthreats prevention. Stakeholders with different expertise are contributing to vulnerability assessment, which can be further combined with attack-scenario analysis to provide more practical analysis. In doing so, we show through a case study evaluation how our proposed framework leverages crucial relationships between vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, in order to narrow further the risk-window induced by discoverable vulnerabilities.","Cyber-physical production system security, Human-in-the-Loop, Reference model, Semantic model, Vulnerability assessment",,,,,,,,"<Cybersecurity for digital manufacturing, {eid: 85044852236}>, <A brief study of Wannacry Threat: Ransomware attack 2017, {eid: 85042754144}>, <None, {eid: 85082104455}>, <A survey of approaches to automatic schema matching, {eid: 0035657983}>, <Cyber-physical systems security-a survey, {eid: 85029396841}>, <An integrated cyber security risk management approach for a cyber-physical system, {eid: 85047820238}>, <A language and repository for cyber security of smart grids, {eid: 85059076918}>, <SECTET: An extensible framework for the realization of secure inter-organizational workflows, {eid: 33750453781}>, <Quantitative information security risk estimation using probabilistic attack graphs, {eid: 85018370233}>, <A cyber-physical attack taxonomy for production systems: A quality control perspective, {eid: 85043396479}>",,,Springer,,,10/29/2019,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85082136847

MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.","Evidence-based software engineering, Grey literature, Guidelines, Literature study, Multivocal literature review, Systematic literature review, Systematic mapping study",,,,,,,,"<Evidence-based software engineering, {eid: 4544225764}>, <Systematic literature reviews in software engineering–a systematic literature review, {eid: 56649086628}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: an update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <Using systematic review methods within a Ph.D. dissertation in political science: challenges and lessons learned from practice, {eid: 84901686086}>, <Software test-code engineering: a systematic mapping, {eid: 84914181487}>, <Including systematic reviews in PhD programmes and candidatures in nursing – ‘Hobsons choice’?, {eid: 84897595016}>, <Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis: understanding the best evidence in primary healthcare, {eid: 84939214241}>, <The role of systematic reviews in evidence-based practice, research, and development, {eid: 49049110198}>, <What we know about testing embedded software, {eid: 85049807004}>, <Software Creativity 2.0, {eid: 80053507768}>, <Experimentation in Software Engineering, {eid: 84949178783}>, <Towards rigor in reviews of multivocal literatures: applying the exploratory case study method, {eid: 84970133401}>, <Towards utility in reviews of multivocal literatures, {eid: 84970277709}>, <The use of grey literature in health sciences: a preliminary survey, {eid: 0025202504}>, <Grey literature searching for Health Sciences Systematic Reviews: a prospective study of time spent and resources utilized, {eid: 84907152613}>, <Grey literature in meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care interventions, {eid: 35549006513}>, <Shades of grey: guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 85031698784}>, <An exploration of technical debt, {eid: 84876410801}>, <None, {eid: 85053865931}>, <Does the inclusion of grey literature influence estimates of intervention effectiveness reported in meta-analyses?, {eid: 0034619036}>, <Systematic mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 85088075417}>, <None, {eid: 85057390331}>, <Grey literature, {eid: 84856535970}>, <Searching for studies, {eid: 84883710616}>, <Finding the hard to finds: searching for grey (Gray) literature, {eid: 85053884408}>, <Global epidemiology of injecting drug use and HIV among people who inject drugs: a systematic review, {eid: 55749095381}>, <Evidence-Based Software Engineering and Systematic Reviews, {eid: 85140160476}>, <Investigating bias in the search phase of Software Engineering secondary studies, {eid: 84936076379}>, <A systematic literature review of literature reviews in software testing, {eid: 84987968030}>, <Citations, research topics and active countries in software engineering: a bibliometrics study, {eid: 84959387510}>, <A bibliometric analysis of the Turkish software engineering research community, {eid: 84942987899}>, <Quantity versus impact of software engineering papers: a quantitative study, {eid: 85020729509}>, <What we know about testing embedded software, {eid: 85049807004}>, <A systematic mapping study of web application testing, {eid: 84878316262}>, <Graphical User Interface (GUI) Testing: systematic Mapping and Repository, {eid: 84880786120}>, <UML-Driven Software Performance Engineering: a Systematic Mapping and Trend Analysis, {eid: 84943001475}>, <A grey literature review of special events for promoting cancer screenings, {eid: 84902702380}>, <Why children are not vaccinated: a review of the grey literature, {eid: 84870248721}>, <A grey literature review of the cultural Olympiad, {eid: 85048901603}>, <Reconceptualizing cultural participation in Europe: grey literature review, {eid: 84884500365}>, <The need for multivocal literature reviews in software engineering: complementing systematic literature reviews with grey literature, {eid: 84978496329}>, <Choosing the right test automation tool: a grey literature review, {eid: 85039445491}>, <Software test maturity assessment and test process improvement: a multivocal literature review, {eid: 85009743225}>, <When and what to automate in software testing?

All rights reserved.In manufacturing, concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) accelerate the development from traditional production facilities towards smart factories. Thereby, emerging digital technologies increasingly connect information networks with production processes, forming complex smart factory networks. Due to their reliance on information flows and the high degree of cross-linking, these networks are, in particular, vulnerable to availability risks caused by attacks and errors. To address this problem, we aim to identify and analyse availability threats by developing a modelling approach that depicts specific characteristics of smart factory networks. Based on modelling requirements derived from a literature review, we propose a modular Petri net approach. To iteratively revise and validate our model, we followed established evaluation principles and conducted evaluation rounds with industry experts and other researchers. To demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of our model, we simulated one real-world use case and two planned extensions of a mechanical engineering company. Our model depicts information-based dependencies within smart factory networks and allows for the simulation and analysis of threat propagation. Thereby, it enables both researchers and practitioners to identify critical network connections and components, serving as a basis for layout decisions and IT security mitigation measures.","Attack Propagation, Availability Risks, Information Network, Petri Nets, Production Network, Smart Factory Network",,,,,,,,"<In quest of benchmarking security risks to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84873293533}>, <When is it unavailability a strategic risk?: A study in the context of cloud computing, {eid: 85107713317}>, <Supply chain modelling and its analytical evaluation, {eid: 0036682210}>, <None, {eid: 0345860166}>, <Petri net control of an automated manufacturing cell, {eid: 0024901564}>, <How virtualization, decentralization and network building change the manufacturing landscape: An industry 4.0 perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Cyber-physical systems: Imminent challenges, {eid: 84868369465}>, <None, {eid: 85071149909}>, <Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks, {eid: 77951126500}>, <Secure control: Towards survivable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 51849091527}>, <Challenges for securing cyber physical systems, {eid: 80055028776}>, <Coloured petri nets extended with place capacities, test arcs and inhibitor arcs, {eid: 85029434486}>, <None, {eid: 84987795037}>, <Cyber physical systems design, methodology, and integration: The current status and future outlook, {eid: 85049585351}>, <Free choice Petri nets, {eid: 0003947126}>, <None, {eid: 85085936534}>, <A generalized stochastic Petri net model for management of distributed manufacturing systems, {eid: 33847191765}>, <A survey of Petri net applications in modeling controls for automated manufacturing systems, {eid: 0028430873}>, <Reset nets between decidability and undecidability, {eid: 84878552622}>, <Investigation of exogenous shocks in complex supply networks -

In contrast to software products running on PCs or smartphones, updating and maintaining cyber–physical systems presents a major challenge. This challenge, combined with the often decades-long lifetime of cyber–physical systems, and with their deployment in often safety-critical contexts, makes it particularly important to consider their security already at design time. When aiming to obtain a provably secure design, model-driven security approaches are key, as they allow to identify and mitigate threats in early phases of the development. As attacks may exploit both code-level as well as physical vulnerabilities, such approaches must consider not just the cyber layer but the physical layer as well. To find out which model-driven security approaches for cyber–physical systems exist considering both layers, we conducted a systematic literature review. From a set of 1160 initial papers, we extracted 69 relevant publications describing 17 candidate approaches. We found seven approaches specifically developed for cyber–physical systems. We provide a comprehensive description of these approaches, discuss them in particular detail, and determine their limitations. We found out that model-driven security is a relevant research area but most approaches focus only on specific security properties and even for CPS-specific approaches the platform is only rarely taken into account.","Cyber–physical systems, Literature survey, Model-driven security, Platform-specific, Security modeling, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<Design methodologies for securing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84963735979}>, <None, {eid: 84981484936}>, <None, {eid: 85086707753}>, <Towards the model-driven engineering of secure yet safe embedded systems, {eid: 84938678794}>, <None, {eid: 85007566152}>, <DREMS ML: A wide spectrum architecture design language for distributed computing platforms, {eid: 84930180339}>, <Ensuring safety, security, and sustainability of mission-critical cyber–physical systems, {eid: 84155165352}>, <None, {eid: 33750960661}>, <A tutorial on uppaal, {eid: 35048862279}>, <Secure Computer Systems: Mathematical Foundations: Technical Report, {eid: 0003400251}>, <Integrity Considerations for Secure Computer Systems: Technical Report, {eid: 0003400255}>, <Towards verified synthesis of ProCom, a component model for real-time embedded systems, {eid: 79960534876}>, <Pride-an environment for component-based development of distributed real-time embedded systems, {eid: 84902154783}>, <Model-driven software engineering in practice, {eid: 84878326137}>, <ProCom – The Progress Component Model Reference Manual, {eid: 70350650120}>, <Functional modeling compiler for system-level design of automotive cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84936887971}>, <Addressing software security in the federal acquisition process, {eid: 84995800777}>, <On the security of public key protocols, {eid: 0020720357}>, <Analysis for security attacks in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85086074073}>, <None, {eid: 34250158136}>, <Taming heterogeneity - the Ptolemy approach, {eid: 0242444222}>, <The EVITA project webpage, {eid: 85086705424}>, <Model-based security testing: a taxonomy and systematic classification, {eid: 84958867836}>, <From embedded to cyber-physical systems: Challenges and future directions, {eid: 84956559487}>, <Replication package for the literature review, {eid: 85086709257, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3843478}>, <A tool-supported method for the design and implementation of secure distributed applications, {eid: 79551530717}>, <SECTET: an extensible framework for the realization of secure inter-organizational workflows, {eid: 33750453781}>, <CoCoME - the common component modeling example, {eid: 54249117804}>, <An ontology of information security, {eid: 85001799494}>, <A Requirement Engineering Driven Approach to Security Architecture Design for Distributed Embedded Systems, {eid: 84938694373}>, <None, {eid: 85086733219}>, <None, {eid: 0024663847}>, <Security in model driven development: A survey, {eid: 80455173460}>, <Secure Systems Development with UML, {eid: 84891477511}>, <None, {eid: 84949203155}>, <Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews, Vol. 33, No. TR/SE-0401, {eid: 27644567603}>, <Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, Vol. 2: Technical Report, {eid: 44649122227}>, <A survey of approaches combining safety and security for industrial control systems, {eid: 84961342778}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <German steel mill cyber attack, {eid: 84979967732}>, <DREMS: A model-driven distributed secure information architecture platform for managed embedded systems, {eid: 84897082425}>, <Safe and Secure Model-Driven Design for Embedded Systems, {eid: 85078197691}>, <None, {eid: 85043324734}>, <Security modeling for embedded system design, {eid: 85043346656}>, <SysML models and model transformation for security, {eid: 84970045832}>, <Cyber-physical systems security: a systematic mapping study, {eid: 85023636879}>, <A general theory of composition for a class of “possibilistic” properties, {eid: 0002426876}>, <Mendeley desktop, {eid: 85086720665}>, <None, {eid: 70349673753}>, <Engineering Secure Software Architectures: Patterns, Models and Analysis, {eid: 85086733779}>, <None, {eid: 84887684517}>, <Domain specific and model based systems engineering in the smart grid as prerequesite for security by design, {eid: 84973889966}>, <Model-based security engineering for cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85006307160}>, <An extensive systematic review on the Model-Driven Development of secure systems, {eid: 84942611940}>, <A UML Profile for MARTE: Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems (2008-06-08), Vol. 2: Technical Report ptc/2008-06-09, {eid: 85086718756}>, <System Design, Modeling, and Simulation.

To this end, several attack modelling techniques can be employed, the attack graph being the most prevalent among them. Unfortunately, the discovery and analysis of all possible attack paths in an attack graph is not possible in systems even of a moderate size. In this work we propose a novel systematic method for discovering and analyzing attack paths in real-world scale interconnected Cyber Physical Systems. The method considers the criticality of each sub-system in discovering paths and the risk to the overall system that each path presents to analyze and prioritize paths. We illustrate the workings of the method by applying to the navigational Cyber Physical Systems of the Cyber-Enabled Ship to identify and analyze highly critical attack paths originating from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and targeting the Autonomous Navigation System (ANS).","Attack path analysis, Autonomous ships, Cyber physical systems, Navigational system",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-security incidents: A review cases in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85049515128}>, <None, {eid: 85082400346}>, <Shipping 4.0 and training seafarers for the future autonomous and unmanned ships, {eid: 85098252363}>, <Evaluating cybersecurity risks in the maritime industry: A literature review, {eid: 85098259890}>, <None, {eid: 85086449047}>, <Cyber security issues in navigation systems of marine vessels from a control perspective, {eid: 85032224560}>, <None, {eid: 85061375749}>, <A survey of attack models for cyber-physical security assessment in electricity grid, {eid: 85076807960}>, <A review of attack graph and attack tree visual syntax in cyber security, {eid: 85083098928}>, <Cyber-attack modeling analysis techniques: An overview, {eid: 85009788830}>, <None, {eid: 84920885575}>, <Evaluating network security with two-layer attack graphs, {eid: 77950788192}>, <A scalable approach to attack graph generation, {eid: 34547239511}>, <Automated generation and analysis of attack graphs, {eid: 44049089202}>, <None, {eid: 85098250142}>, <None, {eid: 4243503824}>, <None, {eid: 85098248781}>, <A graph-based system for network-vulnerability analysis, {eid: 84988504967}>, <Finding optimal attack path using attack graphs: A survey, {eid: 84865284443}>, <Quantitative security risk assessment of enterprise networks, {eid: 85099430113}>, <Computer-attack graph generation tool, {eid: 84964504906}>, <MulVAL: A logic-based network security analyzer, {eid: 85076884574}>, <Topological analysis of network attack vulnerability, {eid: 20444498659}>, <Scalable, graph-based network vulnerability analysis, {eid: 0038687692}>, <Survey of attack graph analysis methods from the perspective of data and knowledge processing, {eid: 85077756860}>, <None, {eid: 58749097495}>, <Practical attack graph generation for network defense, {eid: 39049104457}>, <Distributed attack graph generation, {eid: 84987619351}>, <K maximum probability attack paths dynamic generation algorithm, {eid: 84977568617}>, <Dynamic security risk management using Bayesian attack graphs, {eid: 81455142742}>, <Scalable attack graph for risk assessment, {eid: 83755177309}>, <Exploring risk flow attack graph for security risk assessment, {eid: 84944080112}>, <Finding dependencies between cyber-physical domains for security testing of industrial control systems, {eid: 85060062319}>, <Cyber-attack path discovery in a dynamic supply chain maritime risk management system, {eid: 85029482846}>, <A security analysis method for industrial internet of things, {eid: 85046349771}>, <Attack graph implementation and visualization for cyber physical systems, {eid: 85079057706}>, <Safety related cyber-attacks identification and assessment for autonomous inland ships, {eid: 85079890165}>, <Identifying critical components in large scale cyber physical systems, {eid: 85093114845}>, <None, {eid: 84943192699}>, <None, {eid: 85098252952}>, <A practical approach to stakeholder-driven determination of security requirements based on the GDPR and common criteria, {eid: 85083037726}>, <None, {eid: 85098246820}>, <None, {eid: 0347227352}>, <Shipping 4.0: Security requirements for the cyber-enabled ship, {eid: 85079907992}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,9/14/2020,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85098235746

The required levels of autonomy, openness, and self-adaptation, as well as the dynamic nature of the context of such CPS, result in challenging tasks for their engineering. During operation, unexpected situations in which the system has insufficient knowledge about the current state of the system itself as well as its context may occur. Engineering CPS, e.g., for industrial production sites, must account for such uncertainties the system will have to cope with during its lifetime in a structured and systematic way. Since the development of CPS requires consideration of different system perspectives, current uncertainty modeling approaches cannot be applied right away, as they do not explicitly consider uncertainty aspects that affect different artifacts. To aid the engineering of CPS, this article presents a model-based approach to document uncertainty. We propose 'Orthogonal Uncertainty Models,' which closely integrate with other engineering artifacts from different perspectives, as a means for capturing a dedicated uncertainty viewpoint. Our approach has been evaluated in the industry automation domain. The application shows that the idea of regarding uncertainty within a dedicated perspective is highly beneficial. Particularly, our approach helps to uncover and document uncertainties related to behavioral, functional, and structural properties of a system, as well as uncertainties related to business models that would otherwise possibly remain covert. Note to Practitioners-Identifying and documenting uncertainties, which may occur during operation of a system, is a common problem in engineering processes. Such uncertainties may lead to severe damage, and thus need to be mitigated appropriately. It is crucial to account for these uncertainties during engineering, especially in the early phases. Depending on the specific project characteristics, a multitude of different diagram types are used to model a system. Uncertainties thus reflect in many artifacts, which leads to: 1) redundancies in the specified uncertainty attached to diagram elements and 2) uncertainty information (e.g., about the cause or effect of uncertainty) that is spread across different diagrams. The latter makes it difficult to structure uncertainty information and trace it throughout the engineering process so that uncertainty can be systematically considered. Our approach provides a graphical modeling language that employs a dedicated perspective on uncertainty in separate diagrams that can be linked to any engineering artifact.","Cyber-physical systems, industry automation case study, model-based engineering, orthogonal modeling, uncertainty, uncertainty modeling",,,,,,,,"<Let us work together-task planning of multiple mobile robots, {eid: 0030408703}>, <Smart factory of industry 4.0: Key technologies, application case, and challenges, {eid: 85038869974}>, <A taxonomy of uncertainty for dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 84865127075}>, <Cyber-physical systems challenges: A needs analysis for collaborating embedded software systems, {eid: 85013764660}>, <Software engineering for self-adaptive systems: A second research roadmap, {eid: 84879852118}>, <Model-based documentation of context uncertainty for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85059975857}>, <On the use of orthogonal context uncertainty models in the engineering of collaborative embedded systems, {eid: 85044366725}>, <Fostering concurrent engineering of cyber-physical systems a proposal for an ontological context framework, {eid: 84980395713}>, <The 4+1 View Model of architecture, {eid: 0029408391}>, <Requirements engineering metamodel: An integrated view of requirements, {eid: 80655137959}>, <Research directions in requirements engineering, {eid: 34748841665}>, <Spes xt context modeling framework, {eid: 85030241532}>, <Autonomous indoor exploration via polygon map construction and graph-based slam using directional endpoint features, {eid: 85058665882}>, <Obstacle persistent adaptive map maintenance for autonomous mobile robots using spatio-temporal reasoning, {eid: 85072983958}>, <Optimized multiagent routing for a class of guidepath-based transport systems, {eid: 85042109689}>, <Autonomous robotic exploration by incremental road map construction, {eid: 85076803387}>, <Cooperative transport by multiple mobile robots in unknown static environments associated with real-time task assignment, {eid: 0036817712}>, <A survey of inter-vehicle communication protocols and their applications, {eid: 67650790153}>, <A meta-model for representing variability in product family development, {eid: 27644561199}>, <Variability management in software product lines: A systematic review, {eid: 77954470596}>, <Variability management in software product line engineering, {eid: 34247141998}>, <Bridging metamodels and ontologies in software engineering, {eid: 78650609681}>, <Understanding uncertainty in cyber-physical systems: A conceptual model, {eid: 84977479326}>, <Uncertainty-wise cyber-physical system test modeling, {eid: 85025841433}>, <Hazard relation diagrams: A diagrammatic representation to increase validation objectivity of requirements-based hazard mitigations, {eid: 85018728153}>, <A goal-based modeling approach to develop requirements of an adaptive system with environmental uncertainty, {eid: 77249105104}>, <Understanding the scope of uncertainty in dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 77955449058}>, <Elements underlying the specification of requirements, {eid: 0031506469}>, <Requirements Viewpoint, {eid: 84908254104}>, <A sensor failure detection framework for autonomous mobile robots, {eid: 0031387831}>, <The basic principles of uncertain information fusion.

In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on real-time sensor networks, so as to configure the importance of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics by use of cyber-physical production networks.","Algorithm, Artificial intelligence, Cyber-physical, Internet of Things, Production, System",,,,,,,,"<A hybrid modeling methodology for cyber physical production systems: Framework and key

This paper presents a novel proactive approach to forecast the interrelation of attackers and cyber-physical manufacturing systems to suggest a proper defense strategy to the system managerial. In this research, the zero-sum game payoff function developed in our previous studies is transformed into an epistemic type Bayesian game that addresses uncertainties on types of players. The risk preference behavior also is considered as a characteristic of different types of players and to form the Bayesian utility function. Finally, a numerical example is analyzed with a structured method by developing the Bayesian game, computing Bayes-Nash equilibria, and finding quantal response equilibrium. This approach enables managers to decide a proper defense strategy in advance of experiencing cyber-physical dilemma when there are not enough previous data.","Bayesian game, Best strategy for defense, Cybersecurity in manufacturing, Game theory, Optimization, Quantal response equilibrium, Risk analysis",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS), {eid: 85019605932}>, <Cyber-physical manufacturing cloud: Architecture, virtualization, communication, and testbed, {eid: 85018178147}>, <Security challenges in cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85041117989}>, <None, {eid: 80455177510}>, <Bad parts: Are our manufacturing systems at risk of silent cyberattacks?, {eid: 84933052293}>, <A cyberattack has caused confirmed physical damage for the second time ever, {eid: 85099847544}>, <None, {eid: 85099849867}>, <Understand your cybersecurity threats, {eid: 85099797313}>, <None, {eid: 85052869179}>, <ICS-CERT reports increase in FY2015 infrastructure attacks, {eid: 85099828248}>, <Review of cybersecurity issues in industrial critical infrastructure: Manufacturing in perspective, {eid: 85206595975}>, <Cyber-physical security challenges in manufacturing systems, {eid: 84899102995}>, <Integration of supervisory control with SCADA system for a flexible manufacturing cell, {eid: 84914145588}>, <Cyber-security concerns for total productive maintenance in smart manufacturing systems, {eid: 85083532801}>, <Cyber-physical vulnerabilities in additive manufacturing systems: A case study attack on the.

In healthcare, I-CPS enables the intelligent wearable devices to gather data from the real-world and transmit to the virtual world for decision-making. I-CPS makes our lives comfortable with the emergence of innovative healthcare applications. Similar to any other IIoT paradigm, I-CPS capable healthcare applications face numerous challenging issues. The resource-constrained nature of wearable devices and their inability to support complex security mechanisms provide an ideal platform to malevolent entities for launching attacks. To preserve the privacy of wearable devices and their data in an I-CPS environment, in this article we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model that uses symmetric encryption for establishing secured sessions among the communicating entities. After mutual authentication, the privacy risk associated with a patient data is predicted using an AI-enabled hidden Markov model. We analyzed the robustness and security of our scheme using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic. This analysis shows that the use of lightweight security primitives for the exchange of session keys makes the proposed scheme highly resilient in terms of security, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, the proposed scheme incurs nominal overhead in terms of processing, communication and storage and is capable to combat a wide range of adversarial threats.","Artificial intelligence (AI), authentication, client-server model, industrial cyber-physical systems (I-CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), privacy, security",,,,,,,,"<Next-generation big data analytics: State of the art, challenges, and future research topics, {eid: 85019731149}>, <Privacy-preserving data integrity verification by using lightweight streaming authenticated data structures for healthcare cyber-physical system, {eid: 85046370453}>, <Context-sensitive access in industrial internet of things (IIoT) healthcare applications, {eid: 85042384639}>, <Privacyprotector: Privacy-protected patient data collection in IoT-based healthcare systems, {eid: 85042190860}>, <Secured data collection with hardware-based ciphers for IoT-based healthcare, {eid: 85049792907}>, <A lightweight anonymous user authentication and key establishment scheme for wearable devices, {eid: 85056888201}>, <A realistic lightweight anonymous authentication protocol for securing real-time application data access in wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84994469267}>, <Cloud centric authentication for wearable healthcare monitoring system, {eid: 85045756993}>, <A provably secure, efficient, and flexible authentication scheme for ad hoc wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84962198336}>, <End-to-end security scheme for mobility enabled healthcare Internet of Things, {eid: 84961223694}>, <Certificateless remote anonymous authentication schemes forwirelessbody area networks, {eid: 84891804845}>, <Design of secure and lightweight authentication protocol for wearable devices environment, {eid: 85030632828}>, <The random oracle methodology, revisited, {eid: 4243180376}>, <A logic of authentication, {eid: 0000523051}>, <Privacy-preserving scoring of tree ensembles:Anovel framework for ai in healthcare, {eid: 85062592145}>, <Ai in healthcare: Ethical and privacy challenges, {eid: 85068346761}>, <Modelchain: Decentralized privacypreserving healthcare predictive modeling framework on private blockchain networks, {eid: 85048289322}>, <A fast CP-ABE system for cyber-physical security and privacy in mobile healthcare network, {eid: 85086994476}>, <Functional correctness proofs of encryption algorithms, {eid: 33745433697}>, <Incognito: A method for obfuscating web data, {eid: 85075033657}>, <PPFA: Privacy preserving fog-enabled aggregation in smart grid, {eid: 85041516118}>, <Chaotic map-based anonymous user authentication scheme with user biometrics and fuzzy extractor for crowdsourcing Internet of Things, {eid: 85054018028}>, <Anonymous mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for wearable sensors inwireless body area networks, {eid: 85016030664}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,8/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85097943880

However, several challenges including efficiency, timeliness, and safety still exist in AGVs system in discrete manufacturing shopfloor. To address these challenges, a self-adaptive traffic control model combining behavior trees (BTs) and reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to implement optimal decisions according to diverse, dynamic and complex situations in Industry 4.0 environments. A cyber-physical systems using multiagent system technology is designed in which components such as AGVs and traffic commander are defined as specific agent that cooperates autonomously with each other. Then, the behavior construction model is constructed by BTs to enumerate all the possible states in AGVs traffic control. An RL model is further developed based on the BTs. By using this approach, in this article, AGVs have the ability to adaptively choose the optimal rule-based strategy from existing optional strategies. The case study of the scenario avoiding collisions at intersections illustrates that the proposed model can enhance self-adaptive capability of AGVs traffic control and simultaneously guarantees efficiency, timeliness, and safety.","Automated guided vehicle (AGV), behavior trees (BTs), Industrial 4.0, reinforcement learning (RL), self-adaptive control",,,,,,,,"<Data-driven sustainable intelligent manufacturing based on demand response for energy-intensive industries, {eid: 85088900199}>, <A decision support system for fuzzy multi-attribute selection of material handling equipments, {eid: 22144491205}>, <Decentralized autonomous AGV system for material handling, {eid: 0037109624}>, <An optimization method for shopfloor material handling based on real-time and multi-source manufacturing data, {eid: 84929502166}>, <A radio frequency identification based optimal material delivery method for digital plant production, {eid: 79957483556}>, <CPS-based smart control model for shopfloor material handling, {eid: 85031778396}>, <A cooperative control modelformultiagent-basedmaterialhandlingsystems, {eid: 53849129937}>, <Reinforcement learning: A survey, {eid: 0029679044}>, <Data-driven flotation industrial process operational optimal control based on reinforcement learning, {eid: 85031899344}>, <Decoupled visual servoing with fuzzy Q-Learning, {eid: 85040669019}>, <Motion segmentation and balancing for a biped robots imitation learning, {eid: 85020626163}>, <Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 84924051598}>, <Mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree search, {eid: 84963949906}>, <Smart agents in industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84977992593}>, <Modeling multi-cellular behavior in epidermal tissue homeostasis via finite state machines in multiagent systems, {eid: 68549140311}>, <Agent and cyber-physical system based self-organizing and self-adaptive intelligent shopfloor, {eid: 85014892131}>, <Simulation-based optimisation of logistics distribution system for an assembly line with path constraints, {eid: 84898028834}>, <An ant colony algorithm (ACA) for solving the new integrated model of job shop scheduling and conflict-free routing of AGVs, {eid: 84952864376}>, <Survey of research in the design and control of automated guided vehicle systems, {eid: 27744600972}>, <Application of AI to AGV control-Agent control of AGVs, {eid: 0035836310}>, <A design for a tandem AGVS with multi-load AGVs, {eid: 0347504541}>, <Dynamic-zone strategy for vehicle-collision prevention and load balancing in an AGV system with a single-loop guide path, {eid: 0033729519}>, <The dynamic window approach to collision avoidance, {eid: 0031098777}>, <Anti-collision method for AGV using RFID and zigbee network, {eid: 84893577223}>, <Behavior trees for evolutionary robotics, {eid: 84958949972}>, <Robot soccer control using behaviour trees and fuzzy logic, {eid: 84999635830}>, <Trained behavior trees: Programming by demonstration to support AI game designers, {eid: 85088896514}>, <Building behavior trees from observations in real-time strategy games, {eid: 84969217062}>, <The GPU computing era, {eid: 77951154340}>, <Deep learning, {eid: 84930630277}>, <An adaptive decision-making method with fuzzy Bayesian reinforcement learning for robot soccer, {eid: 85041465903}>, <Evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent learning: A survey, {eid: 84940397349}>, <Q-learning, {eid: 34249833101}>, <Real-time scheduling for a smart factory using a reinforcement learning approach, {eid: 85044791956}>, <Behavior trees: From systems engineering to software engineering, {eid: 78650494936}>, <Decentralized motion planning and scheduling of AGVs in an FMS, {eid: 85030787755}>, <Study of SOM-based intelligent multi-controller for real-time scheduling, {eid: 80053570821}>, <None, {eid: 85091509540}>, <None, {eid: 85088323858}>, <Hierarchical Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, {eid: 85027940635}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,12/1/2021,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85100915241

Further, IoT systems increasingly demand the resilient operability of services, as they become part of critical infrastructures. This leads to a broad variety of research works that aim to increase the resilience of these systems. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making IoT systems resilient. In particular, we first discuss the taxonomy and classification of resilience and resilience mechanisms and subsequently survey state-of-the-art resilience mechanisms that have been proposed by research work and are applicable to IoT. As part of the survey, we also discuss questions that focus on the practical aspects of resilience, e.g., which constraints resilience mechanisms impose on developers when designing resilient systems by incorporating a specific mechanism into IoT systems.","dependability, Internet of Things, resilience, security",,,,,,,,"<A resilient internet of things architecture for smart cities, {eid: 84975127016}>, <The cloud application modelling and execution language, {eid: 85075664856}>, <Blockchain-based smart-iot trust zone measurement architecture, {eid: 85066796089}>, <Shadow honeypots, {eid: 84910683998}>, <None, {eid: 0004048154}>, <A distilled characterization of resilience and its embraced properties based on state-spaces, {eid: 85072873722}>, <Internet of Things: Security vulnerabilities and challenges, {eid: 84961943315}>, <A supervised intrusion detection system for smart home IoT devices, {eid: 85073455917}>, <Modeling and analyzing MAPE-K feedback loops for self-adaptation, {eid: 84953309690}>, <The N-version approach to fault-tolerant software, {eid: 0022252695}>, <A visit to the jungle of terminology, {eid: 85031753623}>, <None, {eid: 0004141256}>, <Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing, {eid: 12344308304}>, <Automating efficient variable-grained resiliency for low-power IoT systems, {eid: 85052762439}>, <Chameleon: A hybrid, proactive auto-scaling mechanism on a level-playing field, {eid: 85053342911}>, <ECDSA on things: IoT integrity protection in practise, {eid: 85005977709}>, <A novel honeypot based security approach for real-time intrusion detection and prevention systems, {eid: 85049025295}>, <Self-adaptation to device distribution in the internet of things, {eid: 85030239458}>, <Cyber resilience in IoT network: Methodology and example of assessment through epidemic spreading approach, {eid: 85070398242}>, <FireDeX: A prioritized IoT data exchange middleware for emergency response, {eid: 85060371184}>, <State machine replication for the masses with BFTSMaRt, {eid: 84912085288}>, <From Byzantine fault tolerance to intrusion tolerance (a position paper), {eid: 80052157228}>, <Resilience is more than availability, {eid: 84855681890}>, <HADES-IoT: A practical host-based anomaly detection system for IoT devices, {eid: 85069961553}>, <None, {eid: 77957941325}>, <The primary-backup approach, {eid: 0001556566}>, <Practical Byzantine fault tolerance, {eid: 0001038609}>, <Soteria: Automated IoT safety and security analysis, {eid: 85077468095}>, <Verifying internet of things safety and security in physical spaces, {eid: 85067055097}>, <Bringing the cloud to the edge, {eid: 84904465488}>, <N-version programming: A fault-tolerance approach to reliability of software operation, {eid: 0003052123}>, <Metrics and measurement of trustworthy systems, {eid: 85011890975}>, <Blockchains and smart contracts for the internet of things, {eid: 84979828304}>, <OnboardICNg: A secure protocol for on-boarding IoT devices in ICN, {eid: 84994082446}>, <Dependable and secure voting mechanism in edge comp, {eid: 85079620256}>, <Diversity on state machine replication, {eid: 85051068561}>, <A model for correlated failures in N-version programming, {eid: 8344241193}>, <On resilience of IoT systems: The internet of things (Ubiquity symposium), {eid: 85045955626}>, <CASCA: A design automation approach for designing hardware countermeasures against side-channel attacks, {eid: 85056373026}>, <A pattern-language for selfhealing internet-of-things systems, {eid: 85115445032}>, <None, {eid: 85058395908}>, <A ZigBee honeypot to assess IoT cyberattack behaviour, {eid: 85027862740}>, <Resilient, crowd-sourced LPWAN infrastructure using blockchain, {eid: 85051634028}>, <Towards a robust, self-organizing IoT platform for secure and dependable service execution, {eid: 85099733793}>, <A new metric to quantify resiliency in networking, {eid: 84867848116}>, <A review on the use of blockchain for the internet of things, {eid: 85047783561}>, <Fog-based secure comm.

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

The complexity of these systems leads to questions about prevalent modeling approaches, their ability to integrate heterogeneous models, and their relevance to the application domains and stakeholders. The methodology for Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) of CPS is not yet fully established and standardized, and researchers apply existing methods for modeling of complex systems and introducing their own. No systematic review has been previously performed to create an overview of the field on the methods used for MPM of CPS. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study that determines the models, formalisms, and development processes used over the last decade. Additionally, to determine the knowledge necessary for developing CPS, our review studied the background of actors involved in modeling and authors of surveyed studies. The results of the survey show a tendency to reuse multiple existing formalisms and their associated paradigms, in addition to a tendency towards applying transformations between models. These findings suggest that MPM is becoming a essential approach to model CPS, and highlight the importance of future integration of models, standardization of development process and education.","Cyber–Physical System, Development process, Formalism, Model, Modeling paradigm, Systematic review",,,,,,,,"<Using model driven engineering to support multi-paradigms security analysis, {eid: 84955284071, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-27869-8_16}>, <Industrial use cases of cyber physical systems in EU projects: Preliminary study., {eid: 85117728800}>, <State-of-the-art on Current Formalisms used in Cyber-Physical Systems Development 1201234567891-0 1: Tech. rep., {eid: 85117700093}>, <Towards a formal specification of multi-paradigm modelling, {eid: 85075937334, doi: 10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00067}>, <Multi-paradigm modelling for cyber–physical systems: a descriptive framework, {eid: 85107508780, doi: 10.1007/s10270-021-00876-z}>, <Designing safe and secure embedded and cyber-physical systems with sysml-sec, {eid: 84955298267, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-27869-8_17}>, <Design and verification of cyber-physical systems using truetime, evolutionary optimization and UPPAAL, {eid: 84969352242, doi: 10.1016/J.MICPRO.2015.12.006}>, <Ensuring safety, security, and sustainability of mission-critical cyber–physical systems, {eid: 84155165352, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2011.2165689}>, <Defining formalisms for performance evaluation with simthesys, {eid: 80055014024, doi: 10.1016/j.entcs.2011.09.004}>, <Exploiting cloudsim in a multiformalism modeling approach for cloud based systems, {eid: 85054447089}>, <Exploiting product forms solution techniques in multiformalism modeling, {eid: 84873339776, doi: 10.1016/j.entcs.2013.07.005}>, <STSM Report: Systematic literature review on multi-paradigm modeling for CPS systems, {eid: 85117726728, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1454531}>, <Usability driven DSL development with USE-ME, {eid: 85028946457, doi: 10.1016/j.cl.2017.06.005}>, <None, {eid: 85117718213}>, <Sustainability in Modelling of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review - Intermediate Technical Report, {eid: 85117688496, doi: 10.5281/ZENODO.1481946}>, <Systematic Literature Review on Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems: Tech.

In CPS, large number of IoT devices (sensors, actuators, etc.) are deployed to collect data to support safety critical smart-world CPS infrastructures such as smart city, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart transportation. The degradation of physical components of safety critical smart-world CPSs would deteriorate the performance of the smart system and lead to loss of human life with significant damage to properties. Hence, planned preventive maintenance replacement of physical components of the system is vital to extend the lifetime of the system, to reduce maintenance cost and to avoid risks that may cause major harm to life and property. In this study, we focus on cost effective preventive replacement strategy that recovers failure of physical components of safety critical smart-world CPSs by mainly considering the deterioration state of the physical component on the availability of the system. In view of the degraded physical component of CPSs, we demonstrate the effects of involving maintenance actions during the deterioration state of physical components of CPSs on its availability. Since timely preventive replacement is crucial to support continuous and effective system operation, we compute the optimum time of the constant-interval of preventive replacement strategy for the physical components of CPSs. In this study, we use Weibull distribution as it is a generalized failure model that has been widely used for process equipment life data analyses. At last, the effects of the shape and the scale parameters on the optimal preventive replacement interval of the physical component are also demonstrated.","Availability, IoT, Preventive maintenance, Safety critical smart-world CPS, Weibull distribution",,,,,,,,"<The new Weibull handbook, 2nd edn, {eid: 85103254300}>, <Cyber physical systems role in manufacturing technologies, {eid: 85046118545, doi: 10.1063/1.5034337}>, <Dependability analysis of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85033466417, doi: 10.1049/iet-cdt.2016.0164}>, <Optimum preventive replacement interval for the physical component of cyber physical systems, {eid: 85103269365}>, <A review of the Weibull distribution, {eid: 0000859680, doi: 10.1080/00224065.1993.11979431}>, <Optimal replacement policy under a general failure and repair model: minimal versus worse than old repair, {eid: 85052125046, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2018.07.032}>, <Optimal preventive maintenance policies, {eid: 0002362385, doi: 10.1287/opre.8.1.90}>, <ICT Agriculture support system for chili pepper harvesting, {eid: 85088264692}>, <Optimization of dynamic preventive maintenance for multicomponent systems, {eid: 85067874407}>, <Optimal spare ordering policy for preventive replacement under cost effective-ness criterion, {eid: 70350354678, doi: 10.1016/j.apm.2009.06.017}>, <Reliability variation and optimal age replacement schedule of compensated discrete multi-state systems, {eid: 85066603727}>, <A multi-stage imperfect maintenance strategy for multi-state systems with variable user demands, {eid: 85084576349, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2020.106508Accessed29June2020}>, <The present status of maintenance strategies and the impact of maintenance on reliability, {eid: 0035505636, doi: 10.1109/59.962408}>, <An integrated logistics model of spare parts maintenance planning within the aviation industry, {eid: 84892417708}>, <Emerging technologies for sustainable smart city network security: issues, challenges, and countermeasures, {eid: 85074951546}>, <A review on maintenance optimization, {eid: 85072727242, doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2019.09.047}>, <Basic research for smart community center planning by applying the concept of CPS (Cyber-Physical System) of smart city, {eid: 85103293382}>, <A periodic maintenance model with used equipment and random minimal repair, {eid: 0025539912, doi: 10.1002/1520-6750(199012)37:6<855::AID-NAV3220370605>3.0.CO;2-U}>, <None, {eid: 0003411445}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Replacement and maintenance decision analysis for hydraulic machinery facilities at reservoirs under imperfect maintenance, {eid: 85086024528, doi: 10.3390/en13102507}>, <Manufacturing system maintenance based on dynamic programming model with prognostics information, {eid: 85014002548, doi: 10.1007/s10845-017-1314-6}>, <None, {eid: 77953911961}>, <Application of dynamic reconfiguration in the design of fault-tolerant production cell, {eid: 0008537730}>, <Health and wellness monitoring using intelligent sensing technique, {eid: 85077228232}>, <None, {eid: 2142685609}>, <Generalized reliability centered maintenance modeling through modified semi-Markov chain in power system, {eid: 84863011635, doi: 10.5370/JEET.2011.6.1.025}>, <S-mote: SMART home framework for common household appliances in IoT network, {eid: 85065072484}>, <None, {eid: 0003752181}>, <Decision mapping and optimal inspection models for plant maintenance: some case studies, {eid: 84890880899}>, <Periodic replacement strategy: optimality conditions and numerical performance comparisons, {eid: 85023164173, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2017.1349953}>, <A repair and replacement policy for repairable systems based on probability and mean of profits, {eid: 85056943510, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2018.11.012}>, <Integrated production and maintenance planning in cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85065396080, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2019.02.095}>, <The generalized age maintenance policies with random working times, {eid: 85031039569, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2017.09.003}>, <A Study on the development and effect of smart manufacturing system in PCB Line, {eid: 85065075156}>, <Preventive and corrective maintenance–cost comparison and cost–benefit analysis, {eid: 84957845906, doi: 10.1080/15732479.2015.1032983}>, <Adjusting Markov models to changes in maintenance policy for reliability analysis, {eid: 85015188370}>, <A combined structural and dynamic modelling approach for dependability analysis in smart grid, {eid: 84877963216}>, <Reliability variation of multi-state components with inertial effect of deteriorating output performances, {eid: 85062569408, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2019.02.018}>, <A two-phase preventive maintenance policy considering imperfect repair and postponed replacement, {eid: 85056719241, doi: 10.1016/j.ejor.2018.10.049}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,10/1/2022,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85103271677

Hence, software engineering plays a critical role in enabling Society 5.0 by providing the necessary technological advances and practices to address societal issues. This paper presents a systematic mapping study that focuses on identifying the key software engineering technologies and challenges that are critical for achieving the goals of Society 5.0. The study begins with an initial set of 1646 peer-reviewed publications, from which a final set of 29 primary studies was selected through a rigorous selection process. The selected studies were subjected to meticulous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis. The primary studies identified 13 software engineering technologies that act as enablers of Society 5.0. However, the application of these technologies also comes with technical challenges. The selected primary studies identified ten software engineering open challenges that hamper the realisation of Society 5.0.

The ISO 23247 standard proposes a reference architecture for digital twins in manufacturing, including an entity-based reference model and a functional view specified in terms of functional entities. During our experience with projects in the field, we noticed that standards, and in particular the ISO 23247 standard, are not completely followed. In this paper, we analyse to what extent digital twin architectures documented in the literature are aligned with the reference architecture presented in the ISO 23247 standard. We achieved this through a mixed-methods research methodology that includes the analysis of 29 digital twin architectures in the manufacturing domain resulting from a systematic literature review of 140 peer-reviewed studies, a survey with 33 respondents, and four semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews. On the basis of our findings, practitioners and researchers can reflect, discuss, and plan actions for future research and development activities.","Digital Twin, ISO 23247, Reference Architecture,

73,,,,Towards trustworthy autonomous systems: A survey of taxonomies and future perspectives,2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The class of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) includes cyber-physical systems leveraging on self-x technologies that make them capable to learn, adapt to changes, and reason under uncertainties in possibly critical applications and evolving environments. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in enabling artificial intelligence technologies, such as advanced machine learning, new threats, such as adversarial attacks, and certification challenges, due to the lack of sufficient explainability. However, in order to be trustworthy, those systems also need to be dependable, secure, and resilient according to well-established taxonomies, methodologies, and tools. Therefore, several aspects need to be addressed for TAS, ranging from proper taxonomic classification to the identification of research opportunities and challenges. Given such a context, in this paper address relevant taxonomies and research perspectives in the field of TAS. We start from basic definitions and move towards future perspectives, regulations, and emerging technologies supporting development and operation of TAS.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,85196343912
