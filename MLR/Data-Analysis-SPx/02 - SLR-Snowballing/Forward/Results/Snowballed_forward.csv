In this regard, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is considered as a key enabler by many central players of the SE community. MBSE has reached an adequate level of maturity, and there exist documented success stories in its adoption in industry. In particular, one significant benefit of utilising MBSE when compared to the traditional manual and document-centric workflows is that models are available from early phases of systems development; these enable a multitude of analyses prior any implementation effort together with other relevant capabilities, like the automation of development tasks. Nonetheless, it is noticeable there is a lack of a common understanding for how formal analyses for the verification and validation (V&V) of systems behaviour, specifically in the early phases of development, could be placed in an MBSE setting.In this article, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic literature review regarding the early V&V of systems behaviour in the context of model-based systems engineering. The review aims to provide a structured representation of the state of the art with respect to motivations, proposed solutions, and limitations. From an initial set of potentially relevant 701 peer-reviewed publications we selected 149 primary studies, which we analysed according to a rigorous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. Based on our results, early V&V has usually the goal of checking the quality of a system design to avoid discovering flaws when parts are being concretely realised; SysML is a de facto standard for describing the system under study, while the solutions for the analyses tend to be varied; also V&V analyses tend to target varied properties with a slight predominance of functional concerns, and following the variation mentioned so far the proposed solutions are largely context specific; the proposed approaches are usually presented without explicit limitations, while when limitations are discussed, readiness of the solutions, handling of analyses simplifications/assumptions, and languages/tools integration are among the most frequently mentioned issues.Based on the survey results and the standard SE practices, we discuss how the current state-of-the-art MBSE supports early V&V of systems behaviour with a special focus on industrial adoption and identify relevant challenges to be researched further.","MBSE, system behaviour, systematic literature review, validation, verification",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003411897}>, <Model-based testing using UML activity diagrams: A systematic

1,,van der Heijden J. (AUID: 42462522500),,Construction 4.0 in a narrow and broad sense: A systematic and comprehensive literature review,2023.0,Building and Environment,,,,,,,10.0,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110788,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110788,"<Victoria University of Wellington>, <Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences>",,"© 2023This article presents a systematic review that assesses the implication of Construction 4.0 from both a narrow perspective centred on technology adaptation, and a broader perspective that includes the implications of Construction 4.0 on society, environment, governance, and technology itself (referred to as ‘SEGT dimensions’). The review draws on a systematic selection and analysis of 131 primary sources, including peer-reviewed articles, books, and chapters published between 2016 and 2023. The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes, and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies, inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry; and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls for a holistic application of this ‘new’ paradigm and refrain from cherry-picking ‘cheap and easy’ technologies and applications; and suggests that the construction industry may be able to leapfrog the ‘4.0’ revolution and directly embrace a ‘5.0’ approach by incorporating a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.",,,,,,,,,"<Investigating major challenges for industry 4.0 adoption among construction companies, {eid:

IoT is an important pillar of the digital twin. The digital twin serves as a crucial link, merging the physical and digital territories of Industry 4.0. Digital twins are beneficial to numerous industries, providing the capability to perform advanced analytics, create detailed simulations, and facilitate informed decision-making that IoT supports. This paper presents a review of the literature on digital twins, discussing its concepts, definitions, frameworks, application methods, and challenges. The review spans various domains, including manufacturing, energy, agriculture, maintenance, construction, transportation, and smart cities in Industry 4.0. The present study suggests that the terminology “3 dimensional (3D) digital twin” is a more fitting descriptor for digital twin technology assisted by IoT. The aforementioned statement serves as the central argument of the study. This article advocates for a shift in terminology, replacing “digital twin” with “3D digital twin” to more accurately depict the technology’s innate potential and capabilities in Industry 4.0. We aim to establish that “3D digital twin” offers a more precise and holistic representation of the technology. By doing so, we underline the digital twin’s analytical ability and capacity to offer an intuitive understanding of systems, which can significantly streamline decision-making processes using the digital twin.","3D digital twin, advanced analytics for digital twin, digital twin, Industry 4.0, IoT digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Towards the future of smart electric vehicles: Digital twin technology, {eid: 85101382380, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2021.110801}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Digital twin-driven simulation for a cyber-physical system in Industry 4.0, {eid: 85069042289}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <Real-time digital twin-based optimization with predictive simulation learning, {eid: 85126095511, doi: 10.1080/17477778.2022.2046520}>, <Introducing digital twins to agriculture, {eid: 85102421457, doi: 10.1016/j.compag.2020.105942}>, <Data-driven digital twin approach for process optimization: An industry use case, {eid: 85062593086}>, <Real-time production optimization-applying a digital twin model to optimize the entire upstream value chain, {eid: 85084781978}>, <Machine learning based digital twin framework for production optimization in petrochemical industry, {eid: 85066307148, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.020}>, <A decision-making framework for dynamic scheduling of cyber-physical production systems based on digital twins, {eid: 85104060789, doi: 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.04.008}>, <Local Decision Making based on Distributed Digital Twin Framework, {eid: 85108022535, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.2806}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2021.103469}>, <The Digital Twin Concept in Industry—A Review and Systematization, {eid: 85093358253}>, <Characterising the Digital Twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520, doi: 10.1016/j.cirpj.2020.02.002}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin application in the construction industry: A literature review, {eid: 85107846403, doi: 10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102726}>, <A review of digital twin applications in construction, {eid: 85129248492, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2022.008}>, <Digital Twin Technology Challenges and Applications: A Comprehensive Review, {eid: 85126301082, doi: 10.3390/rs14061335}>, <City Digital Twin Potentials: A Review and Research Agenda, {eid: 85103506867, doi: 10.3390/su13063386}>, <Digital Twin for maintenance: A literature review, {eid: 85092055078, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2020.103316}>, <A review of digital twin in product design and development, {eid: 85104781858, doi: 10.1016/j.aei.2021.101297}>, <Digital Twin Models in Industrial Operations: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85084241025, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2020.02.084}>, <Digital twin for smart manufacturing, A review, {eid: 85182872185, doi: 10.1016/j.smse.2023.100017}>, <A literature review and design methodology for digital twins in the era of zero defect manufacturing, {eid: 85135173714, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2022.2101960}>, <Digital Twin: Generalization, characterization and implementation, {eid: 85101711357, doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2021.113524}>, <Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247, doi: 10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101837}>, <Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) in Industry 4.0: An Architecture Reference Model, {eid: 85097743225, doi: 10.1016/j.aei.2020.101225}>, <A Digital Twin Reference for Mass Personalization in Industry 4.0, {eid: 85092438322, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2020.04.023}>, <A design framework for adaptive digital twins, {eid: 85084813252, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2020.04.086}>, <Framework for a digital twin in manufacturing: Scope and requirements, {eid: 85083292687, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2020.04.004}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Conceptual digital twin modeling based on an integrated five-dimensional framework and TRIZ function model, {eid: 85089247209, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.07.006}>, <Integrated digital twin and blockchain framework to support accountable information sharing in construction projects, {eid: 85103961430, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103688}>, <Conceptual framework of a digital twin to evaluate the degradation status of complex engineering systems, {eid: 85081581437, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2020.01.043}>, <Digital twin to improve the virtual-real integration of industrial IoT, {eid: 85098952548, doi: 10.1016/j.jii.2020.100196}>, <A Maturity Model for Assessing Industry 4.0 Readiness and Maturity of Manufacturing Enterprises, {eid: 84992560375, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2016.07.040}>, <Understanding Maturity Models.

However, buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations. In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy, flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations, such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a promising area for further investigation.","building operation, data-driven methods, Digital Twin (DT), fault

The concept of a digital twin, incorporating multiple digital technologies, has gained increasing attention. The literature lacks a review of the digital twin concept in thermal comfort and energy consumption for existing buildings. This paper conducts a review of the current state-of-the-art in digital twin (DT) technology for thermal comfort/ energy consumption in buildings. The review employs a scientometric approach and examines various technologies used in creating DTs and a systematic analysis of the methods, technologies, algorithms, and approaches used in digital twin experiments. The results show a growing number of studies in this area, with a focus on thermal comfort monitoring, visualization, tracking, energy management, prediction, and optimization for existing buildings. Furthermore, the prediction of energy consumption using algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep neural networks, and YOLOv4 have been used in buildings. However, the wider adoption of a DT that can facilitate occupants, and thermal sensations, enhance human-centered solutions, and improve energy prediction levels are necessary. There is a need for further international collaboration to expand the studies on digital twins for thermal comfort and energy efficiency. The review highlights the limitations and areas of improvement, such as the limited adoption of sensors for environmental measures, the need for more focus on the subjective perception of occupants, and the need for more comparative studies of algorithms for predicting energy consumption. Further studies can be conducted in areas such as understanding occupant psychological responses/behaviors to comfort in the digital world. This will enhance a more consolidated and robust validation for building performance.","Buildings, Digital twin, Energy consumption, Scientometric review, Thermal comfort",,,,,,,,"<Digital

Considering that buildings are complex geometric structures that may change throughout their lifespan, it is essential to maintain up-to-date DT geometry. Despite its importance, the relationship between a building's physical geometry and its DT counterpart remains under-researched due to technical, financial, and practical challenges. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current research on updating the geometry of DT in construction, identifying gaps and challenges for future research, with a focus on the life-cycle stages where updating the DT geometry is most relevant. Additionally, this paper examines the most used equipment and data collection methods, as well as the data processing and integration techniques used in DT. This study comprehensively reviews and analyses the DT concept, which involves the creation of a virtual model that accurately reflects the geometry of a physical object, and examines the DT concept from this perspective. Through a systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliographic analysis, this research examines various methods for updating the geometry of a DT. The methodology involved analyzing a final sample of 56 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. On the basis of the analysis, the study identifies six main directions that recent publications in this field have focused on. These directions highlight the main achievements and obstacles in the field and include the use of UAV/photogrammetry and laser scanning as data collection methods for building geometry, data visualization, updating the geometry of the virtual model in manufacturing, the application of DT in modular construction, and structural monitoring. Based on the SLR, this study has identified key areas that require further research and existing challenges in updating the geometry of the DT. Addressing these challenges will be critical to promoting the widespread adoption of DT in the construction industry. Therefore, the study highlights the importance of updating geometry data in the DT to improve the quality of the data and maximize the benefits of technology in the construction sector.","Construction industry, Digital twin, Geometry, Life cycle, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin in industry: state-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <DT: manufacturing excellence through virtual factory replication, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin and its implementations in the civil engineering sector, {eid: 85111194484, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103838}>, <Digital twin: enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Differentiating digital twin from digital shadow: elucidating a paradigm shift to expedite a smart, sustainable built environment, {eid: 85104190401, doi: 10.3390/buildings11040151}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098, doi: 10.3390/systems7010007}>, <From BIM to digital twins: a systematic review of the evolution of intelligent building representations in the AEC-FM industry, {eid: 85103484819, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2021.005}>, <Digital twin application in the construction industry: a literature review, {eid: 85107846403, doi: 10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102726}>, <Building Information Modeling (BIM) for existing buildings — literature review and future needs, {eid: 84890525940, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.023}>, <Built Environment Digital Twinning.

However, developing DTs faces challenges due to the fragmented use of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems, and yet a comprehensive study covering these domains is lacking. In response, this paper systematically reviews 20 papers published over the past five years investigating IT and OT systems with two lenses: construction perspective and DT perspective. Through a synthesis of the existing literature, the main challenges and solutions for enabling IT and OT convergence in construction projects are identified and prioritized based on frequency of occurrence in the literature. Next, a discussion explaining how such convergence and integration enables the development of DTs through synchronizing information flows between physical assets and virtual representations is offered. The identified challenges are categorized into four groups including technology, data, organization, and people. The proposed solutions are focused in three common areas of technology, data, and organization. This study concludes that while there are rapidly growing interests around leveraging DT concepts in the construction industry, overcoming the barriers for IT and OT convergence should be a main priority for construction stakeholders looking to enable DTs and realize their benefits. The identified challenges and solutions provide an industry-specific roadmap for digital integration as well as important implications for digital transformation in the construction industry.","Construction Industry, Digital Twin, Information Technology, Operational Technology",,,,,,,,"<Digital twins applications for building energy efficiency: A review, {eid: 85139916828, doi: 10.3390/en15197002}>, <Digital twin application in the construction industry: A literature review, {eid: 85107846403, doi: 10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102726}>, <None, {eid: 85084500337, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-33570-0}>, <Transforming the aec industry: A model-centric approach, {eid: 85106020948}>, <Operational technology and information technology in industrial control systems, {eid: 84983784404, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-32125-7_4}>, <Developing a readiness model and a self-assessment tool for adopting digital technologies in construction organizations, {eid: 85141187616, doi: 10.1080/09613218.2022.2136130}>, <Digital technologies in the architecture, engineering and construction (aec) industry-A bibliometric- qualitative literature review of research activities, {eid: 85107220032, doi: 10.3390/ijerph18116135}>, <Interoperability in construction -

In addition, there is a scarcity of research relating the risks of DT implementation to DT maturity levels, which has hindered the optimum consideration of such risks when DT is adopted at different maturity levels. To address these gaps, this study conducted a literature review of 1889 documents from Scopus and Web of Science databases. After rigorous filtration, 72 documents were selected and comprehensively reviewed. A total of 47 risk factors (RFs) were identified and categorized into opportunities (economic, technical, environmental and sustainability, monitoring and safety, and management) and threats (economic, technical, and policy and management). Subsequently, these RFs were mapped onto the five-level DT maturity model, providing users with insights into opportunities and threats on each level. The exhaustive list of RFs and proposed integration of a DT maturity model with corresponding RFs enables stakeholders to identify the risks in their specific use cases and facilitate the decision-making and success in transition across various levels of DT in real-life construction projects.","automation, construction risk, digital model, digital twin, maturity level",,,,,,,,"<Digital

Over the past decade, a rich and varied literature on the development of new technologies and approaches to implementing product DTs has emerged. This literature has been reviewed multiple times, but the variety in focus and scope of DT reviews has become so extensive that it is challenging to assess our collective understanding and knowledge of DT theory. We address this issue by conducting a systematic umbrella review of product DT reviews, classifying and analysing review themes to understand strengths and shortcomings of product DT literature. Our analysis reveals a key shortcoming in the product DT literature: There is currently little evidence and understanding of DT value. Understanding how DTs provide value to an organisation is of paramount importance, as it will determine the elements of the DT that truly have an effect on value, as well as the mechanisms by which that value is created. We conclude this work by presenting a five-item research agenda to address these shortcomings and develop our understanding of DT value. Since DTs can be complex and expensive to implement, research and practice should focus on those elements of the DT that provide value to the organisation.","Digital Twin, Digital Twin Implementation, Product Digital Twin, Umbrella Review, Value",,,,,,,,"<Systematic review of predictive maintenance and digital twin technologies challenges, opportunities, and best practices, {eid: 85194065397, doi: 10.7717/peerj-cs.1943}>, <A Digital Twin use cases classification and definition framework based on Industrial feedback, {eid: 85195373168, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2024.104113}>, <Delving into the digital twin developments and applications in the construction industry: a PRISMA Approach, {eid: 85185718782, doi: 10.3390/su152316436}>, <Digital twins in the built environment: definition, applications, and challenges, {eid: 85188029504, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105368}>, <Digital twin: a comprehensive survey of security threats, {eid: 85129610160, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2022.3171465}>, <Digital twins in greenhouse horticulture: a review, {eid: 85134715724, doi: 10.1016/j.compag.2022.107183}>, <Stage gate decision making: a scoping review of technology strategic selection criteria for early-stage projects, {eid: 85083017832, doi: 10.1109/EMR.2020.2985040}>, <Digital twin technology for thermal comfort and energy efficiency in buildings: a state-of-the-art and future directions, {eid: 85160107458, doi: 10.1016/j.enbenv.2023.05.004}>, <Human-centric digital twins in industry: a comprehensive review of enabling technologies and implementation strategies, {eid: 85153771805, doi: 10.3390/s23083938}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Aircraft Review and Outlook, {eid: 85091899249, doi: 10.2514/6.2020-0553}>, <Revolutionizing healthcare: a review unveiling the transformative power of digital twins, {eid: 85193246457, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3399744}>, <A survey on digital twin: definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953499}>, <Digital twins in human-computer interaction: a systematic review, {eid: 85138270893, doi: 10.1080/10447318.2022.2118189}>, <None, {eid: 85077958514, doi: 10.1109/ICMECT.2019.8932144}>, <Digital twins for aircraft maintenance and operation: A systematic literature review and an IoT-enabled modular architecture, {eid: 85178913320, doi: 10.1016/j.iot.2023.100991}>, <Digital twins’ applications for building energy efficiency: a review, {eid: 85139916828, doi: 10.3390/en15197002}>, <Digital twin technology challenges and applications: a comprehensive review, {eid: 85126301082, doi: 10.3390/rs14061335}>, <Digital twins: an analysis framework and open issues, {eid: 85136148334, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2022.103763}>, <Using thematic analysis in psychology, {eid: 33750505977, doi: 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa}>, <Digital twin for healthy indoor environment: a vision for the post-pandemic era, {eid: 85159272230, doi: 10.1007/s42524-022-0244-y}>, <None, {eid: 85108827458, doi: 10.3390/app11125519}>, <Enhancing reliability in floating offshore wind turbines through digital twin technology: a comprehensive review, {eid: 85191368237, doi: 10.3390/en17081964}>, <Review of digital twin applications in manufacturing, {eid: 85073116667, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2019.103130}>, <Measuring the value of intangibles, {eid: 84982182183, doi: 10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.07.012}>, <Data management in digital twins: a systematic literature review, {eid: 85153108953, doi: 10.1007/s10115-023-01870-1}>, <Digital twins for wind energy conversion systems: A literature review of potential modelling techniques focused on model fidelity and computational load, {eid: 85121752336, doi: 10.3390/pr9122224}>, <From BIM to digital twins: a systematic review of the evolution of intelligent building representations in the AEC-FM industry, {eid: 85103484819, doi: 10.36680/J.ITCON.2021.005}>, <Producing a systematic review, in: the sage handbook of organizational research methods.

Digital twins, based on computational modeling, have enabled the creation of a digital map for physical structures. Research on digital twins (DTs) for constructed facilities projects has gained widespread traction in the industry. While these applications have increased over the years, there has been sparse review of them. This paper systematically reviews the applications of digital twins in construction using content analysis. We identified and analyzed 53 academic journal and conference papers, which revealed several DT applications that could be categorized into nine areas: lifecycle analysis, facility management, energy, education, disaster, structural health monitoring, DT for cities, infrastructure management, and miscellaneous. This enables the visualization of the current state of DT, comparison with the desired state, and possible integrations with other technologies. Among the observed benefits of DTs are the ability to increase engagement and collaboration, reduce construction and operating costs, reduce human error, automate energy demand, manage assets throughout their lifecycle, and apply structural health monitoring. It also enables the collection of real-time data on an asset’s status, history, maintenance needs, and provides an interactive platform for managing an asset. Future directions include addressing how to standardize data acquisition as well as the semantic interoperability and heterogeneity of data. Additionally, modeling human cognitive processes as well as spatiotemporal information would be beneficial to a smart city and other infrastructure systems, especially in disaster situations.","digital twins, infrastructure, literature review",,,,,,,,"<Classification and analysis of deep learning applications in construction: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85107817167,

In response, the adoption of advanced technologies, like Digital Twins (DT), has emerged as a critical strategy to address these sustainability challenges. DTs create virtual replicas of physical assets, enabling real-time monitoring, optimisation, and informed decision-making, thus enhancing sustainability by improving building performance and energy efficiency while reducing waste. This study explores the application of DT technology in promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions within the construction industry. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current DT implementations and identify key challenges to broader adoption. Using a combination of scientometric analysis and systematic literature review, the study examines the potential of DT to address environmental sustainability in construction while highlighting areas for future research and development. The analysis reveals increasing interest in DTs, with a rise in publications from 2018 to 2024, led by Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania. The literature shows a strong focus on integrating DT with building information modeling (BIM) to optimise energy use and achieve sustainability goals across a building's lifecycle. However, challenges remain, including data integration issues, a lack of standardised protocols, and the need for a more skilled workforce. By addressing challenges and enhancing DT-BIM integration, the construction industry can minimise its environmental impact and progress towards sustainability. The study's findings offer vital insights for future research and industry practices to meet global sustainability targets effectively.","Building information modelling, Carbon, Construction industry, Digital twin, Energy efficiency, Sustainable development, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<Students perception of sustainable construction: accelerating progress towards construction education for sustainable development, {eid: 85097882628, doi: 10.1080/15623599.2020.1861500}>, <An evaluation of sustainable construction perceptions and practices in Singapore, {eid: 85044712493, doi: 10.1016/j.scs.2018.03.024}>, <Implications of occupational hazards on attainment of the sustainable development goals in the Nigerian construction industry, {eid: 85076572728, doi: 10.1088/1757-899X/640/1/012129}>, <Exploring the failure factors of Yemen construction industry using PLS-SEM approach, {eid: 85084154198, doi: 10.1007/s42107-020-00253-z}>, <2021 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction: towards a Zero-Emission, {eid: 85125956922}>, <A review of building digital twins to improve energy efficiency in the building operational stage, {eid: 85186127265, doi: 10.1186/s42162-024-00313-7}>, <Digital twin aided sustainability and vulnerability audit for subway stations, {eid: 85092140180, doi: 10.3390/SU12197873}>, <Digital twinning of building construction processes.

The construction industry’s efficiency has lagged behind other industries for decades due to low productivity, a lack of research, and poor adoption of advancements. Fortunately, the successful development of digital technologies such as Digital Twin (DT) has facilitated growth in many sectors, and DT has the potential to address challenges in building construction projects. While DT is a virtual replica that provides real-time data and analysis of a physical asset to optimize its performance, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a collaborative process for creating, managing, and exchanging information throughout a construction project. BIM is the most efficient way to create an accurate, high-value DT and support industry transformation. An integrated DT and BIM platform can improve building design, construction, and performance in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sectors. Based on a literature review, this research aims to clarify and differentiate DT from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, such as BIM. Related publications from articles about DT and BIM in the construction industry were selected, identified, and organized after careful research of the relevant scientific databases. The research has three primary objectives: (1) to examine the present applications of DT and BIM in the construction industry; (2) to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two; and (3) to develop solutions and design methods for BIM and DT integration in building construction.","building construction, building information modeling (BIM), digital twin (DT)",,,,,,,,"<Digital Twins

A comprehensive review of the existing literature is conducted to address this, offering an up-to-date analysis of relevant content in this field. The methodology employed is a systematic literature review using the Primo multi-search tool, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The selection criteria focused on English studies published between 2012 and 2024, resulting in 201 highly relevant papers. These papers were categorized into seven groups: (a) air transportation, (b) railway transportation, (c) land transportation (road), (d) in-house logistics, (e) water and intermodal transportation, (f) supply chain operation, and (g) other applications. A notable strength of this study is its use of diverse scientific databases facilitated by the multi-search tool. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was performed, revealing the evolution of DT applications over the past decade and identifying key areas such as predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and decision-making processes. This study highlights the varied levels of adoption across different transport sectors and underscores promising areas for future development, particularly in underrepresented domains like supply chains and water transport. Additionally, this paper identifies significant research gaps, including integration challenges, real-time data processing, and standardization needs. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on enhancing predictive diagnostics, automating maintenance processes, and optimizing inventory management. This study also outlines a framework for DT in transportation systems, detailing key components and functionalities essential for effective maintenance management. The findings provide a roadmap for future innovations and improvements in DT applications within the transportation industry. This study ends with conclusions and future research directions.","air transportation, digital twin, in-house logistics, land transportation, operation and maintenance, PRISMA guidelines, railway transportation, supply chains operation, systematic review analysis, transportation system, water and intermodal transportation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85205242173}>, <The Digital Revolution of the Transportation Industry, {eid: 85159144901, doi: 10.1016/j.trpro.2023.02.014}>, <Practical Application of Digital Twins for Transportation Asset Data Management: Case Example of a Safety Hardware Asset, {eid: 85189142458, doi: 10.1177/03611981241231804}>, <Interaction between a Human and an AGV System in a Shared Workspace—A Literature Review Identifying Research Areas, {eid: 85184674605, doi: 10.3390/su16030974}>, <Risk Reduction in Transportation Systems: The Role of Digital Twins According to a Bibliometric-Based Literature Review, {eid: 85191388433, doi: 10.3390/su16083212}>, <A Systematic Literature Review of the Predictive Maintenance from Transportation Systems Aspect, {eid: 85141669124, doi: 10.3390/su142114536}>, <Environmental Sustainability in Maintenance Management of Public Transport Systems: Literature Review, {eid: 85061789158, doi: 10.1109/IEEM.2018.8607535}>, <Onboard Condition Monitoring Sensors, Systems and Techniques for Freight Railway Vehicles: A Review, {eid: 85054665564, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2018.2875160}>, <Condition Monitoring Systems in the Railway Industry BT—Advances in Asset Management and Condition Monitoring, {eid: 85091295854}>, <A Survey on Audio-Video Based Defect Detection Through Deep Learning in Railway Maintenance, {eid: 85132784354, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183102}>, <Perspectives on Railway Axle Bearing Condition Monitoring, {eid: 85062626115, doi: 10.1177/0954409719831822}>, <Towards the Internet of Smart Trains: A Review on Industrial IoT-Connected Railways, {eid: 85021198458, doi: 10.3390/s17061457}>, <An Approach to the Legal Requirements Regarding Railway Transport Safety Monitoring in the European Union, {eid: 85062262700, doi: 10.3846/transport.2019.8528}>, <Offline and Online Measurement of the Geometries of Train Wheelsets: A Review, {eid: 85138451082, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2022.3205691}>, <Prognostics and Health Management: Current State-of-the-Art for Optimizing Aircraft Structural Maintenance, {eid: 85048856292, doi: 10.1109/EuroSimE.2018.8369957}>, <Preventive Maintenance of Transport Vehicles Is It Improving Production Stability of a Smelter?

Digital twins are a powerful consequence of digital transformation. In fact, they have been applied to many industries to enhance operations, predict needs, improve decision making, or optimize performance, even though the definition of digital twins is still evolving. However, their impact on the software industry is still limited. Thus, this work aims to analyze the current adoption of digital twins in the software industry as a potential path to integrate them into application lifecycle management. To achieve this objective, first, the significant characteristics of current digital twins are analyzed in their application to manufacturing to understand how the knowledge and the lessons learned can be transferred to the software industry. Second, a systematic literature review was conducted on Scopus, the Web of Science, and the ScienceDirect database. The literature review revealed 93 documents after data screening and cleaning 251 initial documents. Our main findings are that digital twins are already influencing and will significantly affect the software industry, revolutionizing various aspects of the software development lifecycle. This study tackles what identifies a digital twin in the software industry, the specific domains and areas where they can be applied in the software lifecycle, and the proposed approaches explored to build digital twins for developing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. Finally, this study proposes some guidelines for building digital twins in the context of application lifecycle management. Determining an appropriate roadmap shortly is essential to achieve a widespread applicability to building suitable digital twins and preparing organizations for the software industry.","digital transformation, digital twin, software development, software engineering, software industry",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84962306691}>, <Digital Twins and Cyber–Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison, {eid: 85068798049, doi: 10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014}>, <Digital Twin Perspective of Fourth Industrial and Healthcare Revolution, {eid: 85125714236, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156062}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <A Critical View on PLM/ALM Convergence in Practice and Research, {eid: 85029874943, doi: 10.1016/j.protcy.2016.08.052}>, <PLM/ALM Integration with The Asset Administration Shell, {eid: 85100760400, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2020.11.040}>, <A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins, {eid: 85135797712, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2022.111361}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Steering Representations-Towards a Critical Understanding of Digital Twins, {eid: 85116856610, doi: 10.1007/s13347-021-00484-1}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems: A Literature Review, {eid: 85060302764, doi: 10.19044/esj.2017.v13n36p52}>, <The challenges, approaches, and used techniques of CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0: A literature review, {eid: 85101138866, doi: 10.1007/s00170-020-06572-4}>, <Mist and Edge Computing Cyber-Physical Human-Centered Systems for Industry 5.0: A Cost-Effective IoT Thermal Imaging Safety System, {eid: 85141630669, doi: 10.3390/s22218500}>, <Digital Twin-Driven Human Robot Collaboration Using a Digital Human, {eid: 85120820519, doi: 10.3390/s21248266}>, <Digital-twin-based testing for cyber–physical systems: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85145973213, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2022.107145}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2021.103469}>, <A collaborative network of digital twins for anomaly detection applications of complex systems, {eid: 85137654694}>, <Digital twin-enabled automated anomaly detection and bottleneck identification in complex manufacturing systems using a multi-agent approach, {eid: 85147847425, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.02.008}>, <Digital Twin: Empowering Enterprises Towards a System-of-Systems Approach, {eid: 85075914851, doi: 10.1007/s12599-019-00624-0}>, <Quality-Oriented Digital Twin Modelling Method for Manufacturing Processes Based on A Multi-Agent Architecture, {eid: 85099833723, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2020.10.044}>, <Product Design for Matrix-Structured Manufacturing Systems, {eid: 85133539751, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.270}>, <Digital Twin (DT) based methodology to support effective design of industrial production lines, {eid: 85163840712, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.390}>, <Data Modeling and ML.

The ISO 23247 standard proposes a reference architecture for digital twins in manufacturing, including an entity-based reference model and a functional view specified in terms of functional entities. During our experience with projects in the field, we noticed that standards, and in particular the ISO 23247 standard, are not completely followed. In this paper, we analyse to what extent digital twin architectures documented in the literature are aligned with the reference architecture presented in the ISO 23247 standard. We achieved this through a mixed-methods research methodology that includes the analysis of 29 digital twin architectures in the manufacturing domain resulting from a systematic literature review of 140 peer-reviewed studies, a survey with 33 respondents, and four semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews. On the basis of our findings, practitioners and researchers can reflect, discuss, and plan actions for future research and development activities.","Digital Twin, ISO 23247, Reference Architecture,

This phenomenon has been widely studied in academia and industry. In this study, the concept and definition of DT, as utilized by scholars and researchers in various fields of industry, are summarized. The internal association between DT and related technologies is explained. The four stages of DT development history are identified. The fundamentals of the technology, evaluation indexes, and model frameworks are reviewed. Subsequently, a conceptual ternary model of DT based on time, space, and logic is proposed. The technology and application status of typical DT systems are described. Finally, the current technical challenges of DT technology are analyzed, and directions for future development are discussed.","Digital twin, Digitalization, Information technology, Simulation, Virtual modeling",,,,,,,,"<Virtual carers for the elderly: A case study review of ethical responsibilities, {eid: 85053938603, doi: 10.1177/2055207616681173}>, <Digital master as an enabler for industry 4.0.

DTs, representing virtual replicas of physical objects, products or processes established thanks to a bidirectional continuous flow of information between the physical and the virtual world, are currently adopted in multiple domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, energy, construction, smart cities and smart mobility, etc. DTs live together with the physical system they replicate, receiving the same data and often triggering specific control actions that directly impact on the real system status. When dealing with DTs of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the data sources may be heterogeneous and untrustworthy, which requires the DT to be able to address security issues related to data in transit from/to the physical twin and data at rest. A possible way to address these data security issues consists in adopting Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) which provide several security guarantees on data through cryptographic hashing techniques. In this work, we present a three-fold contribution: (i) we discuss the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the state-of-the-art of the research related to the integration between DLT and Digital Twins, aimed at clarifying relevant aspects such as, among others, what is the favourite DLT choice in existing proposals or what is the type of DT-related information to store on-chain; (ii) leveraging the SLR results and other related research, we propose an architectural framework for the integration of DT and DLTs (more specifically, blockchains); (iii) we validate the proposed architecture by means of two proof-of-concept implementations leveraging different technological stacks and taking into account two different operational scenarios. Finally, we conduct a requirements coverage analysis and compare the PoCs through a coverage matrix.","Blockchain, Data security, Data trustworthiness, Digital Twins, Distributed Ledger Technologies,

The adoption of innovative technologies in banking scenarios allows to access old and new financial services but in a faster and more secure, comfortable, rewarding and engaging way. The number, the performances and the seamless integration of these innovations is a driver for banks to retain their customers and avoid costly change of hearts. The literature is rich in works reporting on the use of technology with direct or indirect impact on the experience of banking customers. Some mapping studies about the adoption of technologies in the field exist, but they are specific to particular technologies (e.g., only Artificial Intelligence), or vice versa too generic (e.g., reviewing the adoption of technologies to support any kind of banking process). So a specific research effort on the crossed domain of technology and Customer Experience (CX) is missing. This paper aims to overcome the following gaps: the lack of a comprehensive map of the research made in the field in the past decade; a discussion on the current research trends of top publications and journals is missing; the next research challenges are yet to be identified. To face these limitations, we designed and submitted 7 different queries to pull papers out of 4 popular scientific databases. From an initial set of 6,756 results, we identified a set of 89 primary studies that we thoroughly analyzed. A selection of the top 20% works allowed us to seek the most performant technologies as well as other promising ones that have not been experimented yet in the field. Main results prove that the combined study of technology and CX in the banking sector is not approached systematically and thus the development of a new specific research line is needed.","artificial intelligence, Banking, blockchains, computer security, disruptive innovation, financial services, information and communication technology, internet of things, product customization, user experience",,,,,,,,"<Determinants of customer experience in new format retail stores, {eid: 84860812471}>, <Customer experience-A review and research agenda, {eid: 85018677446, doi: 10.1108/JSTP-03-2015-0064}>, <The technical aplication of CRM in the retail sector during times of recession: The case of Spain, {eid: 84864119845, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-30457-6_18}>, <None, {eid: 85143543364}>, <Customer experience, {eid: 77954987598}>, <Service research priorities: Managing and delivering service in turbulent times, {eid: 85109193385}>, <Moving the customer experience field forward: Introducing the touch-points, context, qualities (TCQ) nomenclature, {eid: 85085885644}>, <Gaining customer experience insights that matter, {eid: 85058864392}>, <Systematic mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 85088075417}>, <Systematicmapping: Artificial intelligence techniques in software engineering, {eid: 85130778732}>, <Architecting digital twins, {eid: 85130855388}>, <Mapping customer experience: A taxonomical study using bibliometric visualization, {eid: 85086026749}>, <A systematic mapping study on customer loyalty and brand management, {eid: 85063228069}>, <Customer experience in e-learning: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85088508479}>, <Datamining and machine learning techniques for bank customers segmentation: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85090100271}>, <Use of data mining and machine learning techniques for fraud detection in financial statements: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85080991647}>, <Insights into financial technology (FinTech): A bibliometric and visual study, {eid: 85116492141}>, <CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature, {eid: 33644531603}>, <Digital competences, computer skills and information literacy in secondary education: Mapping and visualization of trends and concepts, {eid: 85058860749}>, <Software survey: VOSviewer, a computer program for bibliometric mapping, {eid: 77953711904}>, <The use of blockchain in financial area: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85099000550}>, <The geography of banking: Evidence from branch closings, {eid: 85092097862}>, <Are credit markets still local?

The fuel reduction potential and cost-effectiveness of these vehicles depend on the sizing of the powertrain components and their utilization, which is defined by the energy management system (EMS). The battery is affected by power and capacity reduction over the lifetime of the vehicle, which needs to be considered during the design process to ensure the performance goals throughout the vehicle's lifetime. Current literature regarding battery aging usually contains experimental results, which are not transformed into a useful aging model for system simulations. Consequently, battery aging is often neglected, which is why this article intends to help researchers understand the degradation process of batteries in PHEVs and consider this in their simulation and dimensioning process.

The available research on DT for power plants is limited and lacks details on DT comprehensiveness and robustness. The main focus of the present study is to propose a comprehensive and robust DT architecture for power plants that can also be used for other similar complex capital-intensive large engineering systems. First, overviews are conducted for DT key research and development for power plants and related energy savings applications to provide current status, guidelines and research gaps. Then, the requirements and rules for the power plant DT are established and the major DT components are determined. These components include the physics-based formulations; the statistical analysis of data from the sensor network; the real-time data; the pre-performed localized in-depth simulations to predict activities of the corresponding physical twin; and the system Genome with a digital thread that connects all these components together. Recommendations and future directions are made for the power plant DT development including the need for real data and physical description of the overall system focusing on each component individually and on the overall connections. Data-driven algorithms with capabilities to predict the system's dynamic behavior still need to be developed. The data-driven approach alone is not sufficient and a low-order physics based model should operate in tandem with the updated latest system parameters to allow interpretation and enhancing the results from the data-driven process. Discrepancies between the dynamic system models (DSM) and anomaly detection and deep learning (ADL) require in-depth localized off-line simulations. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the advantages of the developed ADL algorithm approach and DSM prediction of the DT using vector autoregressive model for anomaly detection in utility gas turbines with data from an operational power plant.","Anomaly Detection and deep Learning (ADL), Digital twin, Dynamic system model (DSM), Energy cyber–physical systems, Energy savings, Power plant, Sensor network",,,,,,,,"<A reliable and useful method to determine the saturation state from Helmholtz energy equations of state, {eid: 79952312135, doi: 10.1299/jtst.3.442}>, <Digital twin conceptual model within the context of internet of things, {eid: 85093837667, doi: 10.3390/fi12100163}>, <Blockchain technology in the energy sector: A systematic review of challenges and opportunities, {eid: 85055874134, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2018.10.014}>, <Composition and application of power system digital twins based on ontological modeling, {eid: 85079066546, doi: 10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972267}>, <Cloud-based digital twin for robot integration in intelligent manufacturing systems, {eid: 85087010161, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-48989-2_60}>, <Twin-control a digital twin approach to improve machine tools lifecycle. vol. 59, {eid: 85126373410, doi: 10.1097/01.fch.0000336108.22926.39}>, <The industry use cases for the digital twin idea, {eid: 85076597178, doi: 10.1016/bs.adcom.2019.10.008}>, <Concept of automated malfunction detection of large turbomachinery using machine learning on transient data, {eid: 85061502457, doi: 10.29354/diag/100399}>, <Signal-based metamodels for predictive reliability analysis and virtual testing, {eid: 85061708197, doi: 10.25046/aj030141}>, <Development of a diesel engines digital twin for predicting propulsion system dynamics, {eid: 85079549852, doi: 10.1016/j.energy.2020.117126}>, <Digital twin for tuning of server fan controllers, {eid: 85079073710, doi: 10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972291}>, <Embedded digital twins in future energy management systems: paving the way for automated grid control, {eid: 85092047837, doi: 10.1515/auto-2020-0086}>, <Recent and prospective developments in power system control centers: Adapting the digital twin technology for application in power system control centers, {eid: 85050252398, doi: 10.1109/ENERGYCON.2018.8398846}>, <Enhancing energy efficiency through industry partnership. vol. 4, {eid: 85079596128}>, <Energy-aware resources in digital twin: The case of injection moulding machines, {eid: 85070656949, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-27477-1_14}>, <Improving the performance of centrifugal pumps in serial and parallel configurations using digital twins, {eid: 85078784177, doi: 10.1115/IMECE2019-12038}>, <Sensor reliability in cyber–physical systems using internet-of-things data: A review and case study, {eid: 85073410119, doi: 10.3390/rs11192252}>, <Energy-aware resources in digital twin: the case of injection molding machines to cite this version: HAL id: hal-02382494 energy-aware resources in digital twin: the case of injection molding machines to cite this version: HAL id: hal-02382494, {eid: 85126368668}>, <None, {eid: 85126377781}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical system for sustainable project scheduling, {eid: 85079645451, doi: 10.1109/IEEM44572.2019.8978712}>, <Review of digital twin applications in manufacturing, {eid: 85073116667, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2019.103130}>, <Release on the IAPWS formulation 2011 for the thermal conductivity of ordinary water substance, {eid: 84880948365}>, <Digital geometry to support a gas turbine digital twin, {eid: 85083944361, doi: 10.2514/6.2019-1715}>, <Deep learning for hybrid 5G services in mobile edge computing systems: Learn from a digital twin, {eid: 85077264316, doi: 10.1109/TWC.2019.2927312}>, <Challenges of developing a digital twin model of renewable energy generators, {eid: 85070581600, doi: 10.1109/ISIE.2019.8781529}>, <Directive 2012/27/EU of the European parliament and of the council of 25 2012 on energy efficiency, {eid: 84892997506}>, <International energy outlook 2019.

Producers of these distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (dCPS) face serious challenges with respect to designing the next generations of these machines and require proper support in making (early) design decisions to avoid expensive and time consuming oversights. This calls for efficient and scalable system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) methods for dCPS. In this position paper, we review the current state of the art in DSE, and argue that efficient and scalable DSE technology for dCPS is more or less non-existing and constitutes a largely unchartered research area. Moreover, we identify several re-search challenges that need to be addressed and discuss possible directions for targeting such DSE technolozy for dCPS.","Design Space Exploration, Distributed

Much research on Cleaner Production has been carried out worldwide. However, research that addresses the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in Cleaner Production practices is still insufficient and unclear. Based on this scenario, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore research trends regarding Cleaner Production using Industry 4.0 technologies. Publication data were collected from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and the time frame was 2011 to 2023. The results presented the journals, countries, themes, and studies with the most significant impact. In this study, 112 papers on the context of Cleaner Production in Industry 4.0 and its technologies were identified. The results obtained can help scholars better understand the research development trends in Cleaner Production using tools from Industry 4.0, detect unexplored areas, and provide direction for future research.","bibliometric analysis, Cleaner production, global research, industry 4.0, literature review",,,,,,,,"<A lean and cleaner production benchmarking method for sustainability assessment: a study of manufacturing companies in Brazil, {eid: 85041135310, doi: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.145}>, <Leveraging optimized and cleaner production through industry 4.0, {eid: 85099062756, doi: 10.1016/j.spc.2021.01.001}>, <Enhancing the assessment of Cleaner production practices for sustainable development: the five sectors sustainability Model applied to water and wastewater treatment companies, {eid: 85128363816, doi: 10.3390/su14074126}>, <Overcoming barriers to the implementation of Cleaner production in small enterprises in the mechanics industry: exploring economic gains and contributions for sustainable development goals, {eid: 85126281001, doi: 10.3390/su14052944}>, <Identifying and prioritizing impediments of industry 4.0 to sustainable digital manufacturing: a mixed method approach, {eid: 85129093216, doi: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131639}>, <Industry 4.0 and the circular economy: a proposed research agenda and original roadmap for sustainable operations, {eid: 85045041008, doi: 10.1007/s10479-018-2772-8}>, <Evaluating challenges to industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies, {eid: 85046692632, doi: 10.1016/j.psep.2018.04.018}>, <The role and impact of industry 4.0 and the internet of things on the business strategy of the value chain–the case of Hungary, {eid: 85054069142, doi: 10.3390/su10103491}>, <Is circular economy the key to transitioning towards sustainable development?

However, the control performance and stability of the PV system is seriously affected by the interaction between PV internal control loops and the external power grid. The impact of the PV system on the reliability, stability, and power quality of power systems has restricted them to further participate in power supplies with a large capacity. Traditional control methods have become ineffective at dealing with these problems as the PV system becomes increasingly complex and nonlinear. Intelligent control as a more advanced technology has been integrated into the PV system to improve system control performance and stability. However, intelligent control for the PV system is still in the early stages due to the extensive calculation and intricate implementation of intelligent algorithms. Further investigations should be carried out to effectively combine intelligent control with the PV system to constitute an intelligent PV power system with multiple functions, high stability, and high-performance. This paper provides a systematic classification and detailed introduction of various intelligent optimization methods in a PV inverter system based on the traditional structure and typical control. The future trends and research topics are given to provide a reference for the intelligent optimization control in the PV system.","intelligent optimization, inverter control, PV system,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Cloud computing has become integral lately due to the ever‐expanding Internet‐of‐things (IoT) network. It still is and continues to be the best practice for implementing complex computational applications, emphasizing the massive processing of data. However, the cloud falls short due to the critical constraints of novel IoT applications generating vast data, which entails a swift response time with improved privacy. The newest drift is moving computational and storage resources to the edge of the network, involving a decentralized distributed architecture. The data processing and analytics perform at proximity to end‐users, and overcome the bottleneck of cloud computing. The trend of deploying machine learning (ML) at the network edge to enhance computing applications and services has gained momentum lately, specifically to reduce latency and energy consumed while optimizing the security and management of resources. There is a need for rigorous research efforts oriented towards developing and implementing machine learning algorithms that deliver the best results in terms of speed, accuracy, storage, and security, with low power consumption. This extensive survey presented on the prominent computing paradigms in practice highlights the latest innovations resulting from the fusion between ML and the evolving computing paradigms and discusses the underlying open research challenges and future prospects.","Cloud computing, Edge computing, Fog computing, Internet‐of‐things, Machine learning",,,,,,,,"<A View of Cloud Computing, {eid: 77950347409, doi: 10.1145/1721654.1721672}>, <All One Needs to Know about Fog Computing and Related Edge Computing Paradigms: A Complete Survey, {eid: 85061747900, doi: 10.1016/j.sysarc.2019.02.009}>, <Atmosphere: Context and Situational‐Aware Collaborative IoT Architecture for Edge‐Fog‐Cloud Computing, {eid: 85109793830, doi: 10.1016/j.csi.2021.103550}>, <A Survey on Resilience in the IoT: Taxonomy, Classification, and Discussion of Resilience Mechanisms, {eid: 85115446129, doi: 10.1145/3462513}>, <Fog Computing and Internet of Things in One Building Block: A Survey and an Overview of Interacting Technologies, {eid: 85105494106, doi: 10.1007/s10586‐021‐03286‐4}>, <Advantages of Using Fog in IoT Applications, {eid: 85092287672, doi: 10.1007/s41870‐020‐00514‐9}>, <The Promise of Edge Computing, {eid: 84969922595, doi: 10.1109/MC.2016.145}>, <Comparison of Edge Computing Implementations: Fog Computing, Cloudlet and Mobile Edge Computing, {eid: 85029319174, doi: 10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016213}>, <A Framework of Fog Computing: Architecture, Challenges, and Optimization, {eid: 85032446751, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766923}>, <None, {eid: 85059470935}>, <Optimizing Green Computing Awareness for Environmental Sustainability and Economic Security as a Stochastic Optimization Problem, {eid: 85031812696, doi: 10.3390/su9101857}>, <Modelling of Internet of Things Units for Estimating Security‐Energy‐ Performance Relationships for Quality of Service and Environment Awareness: Modelling of IoT Units for Estimating Quality of Service, {eid: 84968570942, doi: 10.1002/sec.1537}>, <A Review of Internet of Things Technologies for Ambient Assisted Living Environments, {eid: 85079638198, doi: 10.3390/fi11120259}>, <Understanding the Internet of Things: Definition, Potentials, and Societal Role of a Fast Evolving Paradigm, {eid: 85009285034, doi: 10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.12.004}>, <Survey on Fog Computing: Architecture, Key Technologies, Applications and Open Issues, {eid: 85029368813, doi: 10.1016/j.jnca.2017.09.002}>, <Fog Computing: A Taxonomy, Survey and Future Directions, {eid: 85082363829, doi: 10.1007/978‐981‐10‐5861‐5_5}>, <A Survey on Internet of Things: Architecture, Enabling Technologies, Security and Privacy, and Applications, {eid: 85026378512, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2017.2683200}>, <A Survey on Mobile Edge Computing: The Communication Perspective, {eid: 85028734877, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2017.2745201}>, <Ensemble machine learning approaches for webshell detection in Internet of things environments, {eid: 85089497009, doi: 10.1002/ett.4085}>, <A Comprehensive Survey on Fog Computing: State‐of‐the‐Art and Research Challenges, {eid: 85033670467, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2017.2771153}>, <Survey of Fog Computing: Fundamental, Network Applications, and Research Challenges, {eid: 85043456909, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2018.2814571}>, <Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Cloud, Cloudlet, Mobile IoT, IoT Cloud, Fog, Mobile Edge, and Edge Emerging Computing Paradigms: Disambiguation and Research Directions, {eid: 85059703768, doi: 10.1016/j.jnca.2018.10.021}>, <Fog Computing and the Internet of Things: A Review, {eid: 85089836933, doi: 10.3390/bdcc2020010}>, <Moving to the Edge‐Cloud‐of‐Things: Recent Advances and Future Research Directions, {eid: 85057330273, doi: 10.3390/electronics7110309}>, <A Review of Fog Computing and Machine Learning: Concepts, Applications, Challenges, and Open Issues, {eid: 85074636899, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947542}>, <Edge Computing: A Survey, {eid: 85062554066, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.02.050}>, <An Overview on Edge Computing Research, {eid: 85085145884, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991734}>, <Internet of Things: Applications, Adoptions and Components—A Conceptual Overview, {eid: 85105930557, doi: 10.1007/978‐3‐030‐73050‐5_50}>, <Fog Computing Systems: State of the Art, Research Issues and Future Trends, with a Focus on Resilience, {eid: 85089433430, doi: 10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102784}>, <Performance Evaluation Metrics for Cloud, Fog and Edge Computing: A Review, Taxonomy, Benchmarks and Standards for Future Research, {eid: 85110073014, doi: 10.1016/j.iot.2020.100273}>, <The Fog Cloud of Things: A Survey on Concepts, Architecture, Standards, Tools, and Applications, {eid: 85092163275, doi: 10.1016/j.iot.2020.100177}>, <None, {eid: 77954051808}>, <None, {eid: 84865100547}>, <Internet of Things: A Definition & amp;

The traditional use of cloud services, focused on the consumption of one provider, is not valid anymore due to different shortcomings being the risk of vendor lock-in a critical. We are assisting to a change of paradigm, from the usage of a single cloud provider to the combination of multiple cloud service types, affecting the way in which applications are designed, developed, deployed and operated over such heterogeneous ecosystems. The result is an effective heterogeneity of architectures, methods, tools, and frameworks, copying with the multi-cloud application concept. The goal of this study is manifold. Firstly, it aims to characterize the multi-cloud concept from the application development perspective by reviewing existing definitions of multi-cloud native applications in the literature. Secondly, we set up the basis for the architectural characterization of these kind of applications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues drawn up from the analysis carried out. To achieve that, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), where, a large set of primary studies published between 2011 and 2021 have been studied and classified. The in-depth analysis has revealed five main research trends for the improvement of the development and operation DevOps lifecycle of “multi-cloud native applications”. The paper finishes with directions for future work and research challenges to be addressed by the software community.","Hybrid cloud, Multi-cloud native application, Software architecture, Software
