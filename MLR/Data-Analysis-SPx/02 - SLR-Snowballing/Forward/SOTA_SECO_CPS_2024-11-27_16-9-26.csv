This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes.","building information modeling, building lifecycle data, building permits, city information model, digital twins, GeoBIM, information model-based urban planning",,,,,,,,"<Automatic rule-based checking of building designs, {eid: 70349429622, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2009.07.002}>, <BIM for public authorities: Basic research for the standardized implementation of BIM in the building permit process, {eid: 85073033386, doi: 10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012102}>, <None, {eid: 85199664264}>, <A State-of-the-Art Review on the Integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS), {eid: 85014918203, doi: 10.3390/ijgi6020053}>, <From Geotechnical Data to GeoBIM Models: Testing Strategies for an Ex-Industrial Site in Turin, {eid: 85172807488, doi: 10.3390/buildings13092343}>, <BIM- and GIS-Based Life-Cycle-Assessment Framework for Enhancing Eco Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector, {eid: 85185888364, doi: 10.3390/buildings14020360}>, <An integrated building information modeling (BIM)-based lifecycle-oriented framework for sustainable building design, {eid: 85139162343, doi: 10.1108/CI-02-2021-0011}>, <Asset Information Model Management-Based GIS/BIM Integration in Facility Management Contract, {eid: 85189030595, doi: 10.3390/su16062495}>, <None, {eid: 38649094993}>, <Building Information Modeling: Why?

The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This article reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modeling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS and to prove relevant attributes such as system safety in the presence of intelligent behaviors and uncertainties.","Additional Key Words and PhrasesAutonomous cyber-physical production systems,

Firstly, the development status of smart grid digital twins was investigated and summarized from typical architectures, key technologies, and application directions. Then, based on modern information technology, we proposed the architecture and deployment method of the intelligent substation digital twin system. The proposed system consists of a data collection layer, a model driven layer, and a twin application layer, which respectively elaborate on the specific content and advantages, and supplement the complete deployment method of the system. The intelligent substation digital twin system effectively promotes the digitization and intelligence of substations, providing a new construction and management mode, and has potential application prospects in promoting equipment status perception, deterioration trend analysis, and fault handling in the power industry.","digital twin, equipment status perception, intelligent substations, modern information technology",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85184990269}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shop floor management system in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Toward a Digital Twin for real-Time geometry assurance in individualized production, {eid: 85018779245}>, <Design and testing of a modular SiC based power block, {eid: 85018331557}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A probabilistic graphical model foundation for enabling predictive digital twins at scale, {eid: 85115144191}>, <For a digital twin of the gridSiemens solution enables a single digital grid model of the Finnish power systemR/OL, {eid: 85064141464}>, <Analytic engine for the digital power plantR/OL, {eid: 85185003399}>, <Technology features of the new generation power system in China, {eid: 85051245830}>, <Short-Term prediction of electronic transformer error based on intelligent algorithms, {eid: 85091971791}>, <Challenges on coordinated planning of smart distribution networks driven by source-network-load evolution, {eid: 85084734526}>, <New issues and classification of power system stability with high shares of renewables and power electronics, {eid: 85101073118}>, <Key scientific issues and theoretical research framework for power systems with high proportion of renewable energy, {eid: 85021001702}>, <Five-dimension digital twin model and its ten applications, {eid: 85064443425}>, <Active compliance control system for intelligent inspection robot in power room, {eid: 85139383617}>, <Framework design and application prospect for digital twin virtual power plant system, {eid: 85160951924}>, <Concept, Architecture and Key Technologies of Digital Power Grids, {eid: 85137812162}>, <Survey on Characteristics, Architecture and Applications of Digital Twin Power Grid, {eid: 85149646782}>, <Application and implementation method of digital twin in electric equipment, {eid: 85107458545}>, <Development patterns and challenges of ubiquitous power internet of things, {eid: 85079544635}>, <Networked Closed-Loop Model for Smart On-Site Maintenance of Substation Equipment Using Mobile Networks, {eid: 85049325561}>, <Equivalent modeling of virtual synchronous generator based on data-driven method, {eid: 85079413045}>, <Overview on cyber-Attacks against cyber physical power system, {eid: 84987802574}>, <Typical application and prospect of digital twin technology in power grid operation, {eid: 85107412686}>, <Concepts, characteristics and prospects of application of digital twin in power system, {eid: 85124807412}>, <Application of digital twin assistant-system in state estimation for inverter dominated grid, {eid: 85095575749}>, <State evaluation of power transformer based on digital twin, {eid: 85078834715}>, <Wind power fluctuation smooth strategy based on digital twin hybrid energy storage, {eid: 85109478754}>, <A software platform for secondorder responsiveness power grid online analysis, {eid: 85091590535}>, <Digital twin framework and its application to power grid online analysis, {eid: 85077253897}>, <A digital twin approach for fault diagnosis in distributed photovoltaic systems, {eid: 85074215768}>, <State evaluation and fault prediction of distribution automation terminal equipment based on digital twins, {eid: 85128493248}>, <Detection method of interturn short-circuit faults in oilimmersed transformers based on fusion analysis of electrothermal characteristic, {eid: 85109474528}>, <None, {eid: 85185007561}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-27,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85184999334

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

Reaching Net Zero depends on datafication and digitisation as data on carbon emissions collected across assets’ lifecycle are important for neutralising them. This study aims to understand how technological ecosystems such as Digital Twins – that connect physical and digital artefacts – can support a Net Zero vision in the built environment, in an industry-agnostic way to transfer any relevant lessons from other sectors. The method is a systematic literature review that structures new knowledge on the topic. The study showed that environment sustainability has been an overused idea in scientific literature, yet rarely operationalised. A scarcity of studies utilising the potential of digital twins for Net Zero was found. The emergent themes are: overreliance on technocratic solutions at the expense of systems thinking, proliferation of renewable sources and misunderstandings regarding visualisation necessity, and showing pathways for future DT system design for Net Zero.","Digital twins, model-based systems engineering, net zero, review, sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Shades of grey: Guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 84964407503}>, <Imagining construction’s digital future.

A digital twin is defined as the virtual representation of a physical asset that collects and sends real-time information. A digital twin collects data from the physical asset in real-time and uses this data to create a virtual model of the physical object. Its functionality depends on the bi-directional coordination of data between the physical and virtual models. This is likened to cyber-physical systems, which seek to provide bi-directional coordination between the physical and virtual worlds. While digital twins have found applications in the various industrial sectors such as aerospace, manufacturing, and industrial engineering, their applications in the construction industry are relatively limited. Although some level of progress has been made in the construction industry with the application of a digital twin, it still lags in other sectors. Virtual models of constructed facilities are developed and used to plan and construct the actual facility, with changes in the physical facility being automatically reflected in the virtual model based on real-time data and vice-versa. The digital twin shows promising possibilities in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. This paper reviews the development and implementation of digital twin technology in the construction industry and compares its use with other industries while assessing the benefits of DT to the construction industry. A systematic literature review including a thematic analysis was employed to address the purpose of this study. Limitations associated with the existing and emerging applications are also identified. It concludes by highlighting the importance of DT applications in the construction sector.","Bi-directional, Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Analytics, Digital Twin, Real-Time, Virtual Model",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916}>, <None, {eid: 85129240368}>, <Prioritizing object types for modeling existing industrial facilities, {eid: 85054099413}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Integration of BIM and the Physical Construction, Engineering, Construction, and Architectural Management: Special Issue on Advanced ICT and Smart Systems for Innovative Engineering, {eid: 84942110767}>, <Mechanisms for Bi-directional Coordination between Virtual Design and the Physical Construction, {eid: 85129249130}>, <An RTLS-based Approach to Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Design and Construction, {eid: 84872813621, doi: 10.1155/2012/596845}>, <Scenarios for Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Construction, {eid: 84880055872}>, <Towards next-generation cyber-physical systems and digital twins for construction, {eid: 85112133397, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2021.027}>, <Thematic Analysis: A critical review of its process and evaluation, {eid: 84978175524}>, <Managing health care organizations: where professionalism meets complexity science, {eid: 0033995008}>, <Towards a Cyber-Physical Systems Approach to Construction, {eid: 77956305933}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Development for Construction Applications, {eid: 85112129345, doi: 10.1007/s42524-020-0130-4}>, <None, {eid: 85112719218}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958}>, <Digital twin creates the blueprint for future smart buildings, {eid: 85129235765}>, <Patient flow modeling and performance analysis of healthcare delivery processes in hospitals: A review and reflections, {eid: 84912522613}>, <Next-generation digital twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <None, {eid: 0003482307}>, <BIM-Based Progress Monitoring, {eid: 85063561288}>, <Built environment digital twinning, {eid: 85108350238}>, <Innovative Thinker -

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.","Digital shadows, Industrial internet of things, Internet of production, World wide lab",,,,,,,,"<Deploying fog computing in industrial internet of things and industry 4. 0, {eid: 85049803971}>, <Peeking inside the black-box: A survey on explainable artificial intelligence, {eid: 85053352477}>, <A framework for explainable concept drift detection in process mining, {eid: 85115178805}>, <Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, {eid: 85077515399}>, <Blockchain-based privacy preservation for supply chains supporting lightweight multi-hop information accountability, {eid: 85100453781}>, <Ironies of automation, {eid: 0020843464}>, <The Physical Internet, {eid: 84923153575}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The ironies of automation: Still going strong at 30?, {eid: 84875427820}>, <A conceptual model for digital shadows in industry and its application, {eid: 85118142665}>, <Edge cloud as an enabler for distributed AI in industrial IoT applications: The experience of the IoTwins project, {eid: 85075928612}>, <None, {eid: 85054023050}>, <Model-driven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <How context and design shape human-robot trust and attributions, {eid: 85097184876}>, <A digital twin for production planning based on cyber-physical systems: A case study for a cyber-physical system-based creation of a digital twin, {eid: 85065427421}>, <Domain-specific language for sensors in the internet of production, {eid: 85165962517}>, <None, {eid: 84995466560}>, <The road to european digital sovereignty with gaia-x and IDSA, {eid: 85103448059}>, <What happens when decision support systems fail?-The importance of usability on performance in erroneous systems, {eid: 85062364168}>, <None, {eid: 80054884442}>, <Towards a continuously improving composites manufacturing by employing the internet of production, {eid: 85124263660}>, <Process prediction with digital twins, {eid: 85121810059}>, <Challenges in automotive software engineering, {eid: 34247127701}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Holarchy for line-less mobile assembly systems operation in the context of the internet of production, {eid: 85106412122}>, <None, {eid: 84946229140}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <A compositional framework for systematic modeling language reuse, {eid: 85096955321}>, <Reducing complexity with simplicity-usability methods for industry 4. 0, {eid: 84986543578}>, <None, {eid: 85127453330}>, <Towards low latency industrial robot control in programmable data planes, {eid: 85091982375}>, <Goal-oriented modelling of relations and dependencies in data marketplaces, {eid: 85049320311}>, <Concern-oriented language development: Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 85112723943}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <Industry 4. 0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <None, {eid: 0003939293}>, <Easing the conscience with OPC UA: An internet-wide study on insecure deployments, {eid: 85097285990}>, <Missed opportunities: Measuring the untapped TLS support in the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85133169932}>, <Transparent end-to-end security for publish/subscribe communication in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85107432740}>, <Towards sustainable systems engineering-integrating tools via component and connector architectures, {eid: 85127185370}>, <Model-driven systems engineering for virtual product design, {eid: 85075936044}>, <Towards a modeldriven architecture for interactive digital twin cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <Hybrid intelligence, {eid: 85069455009}>, <What does explainable AI really mean?

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.","Cloud robotics, Industry 40, model-driven, reference

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.","CPS, model-driven design, system-performance engineering",,,,,,,,"<Total productive maintenance: Literature review and directions, {eid: 49149086860}>, <An empirical survey-based study into industry practice in real-time systems, {eid: 85101615395}>, <A framework for scheduler synthesis, {eid: 0033337591}>, <Uppaal 4.0, {eid: 36148931085}>, <A markovian decision process, {eid: 0001700171}>, <Decision support methodology for evolutionary embedded system design, {eid: 85081093306}>, <None, {eid: 49049085902}>, <On methods and tools for rigorous system design, {eid: 85108822937}>, <None, {eid: 85034418483}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Model-based diagnosis for cyber-physical production systems based on machine learning and residual-based diagnosis models, {eid: 85074197869}>, <None, {eid: 85104646994}>, <None, {eid: 85087734433}>, <None, {eid: 0003962322}>, <The concept of reference architectures, {eid: 74549119498}>, <Dynamic modeling of the tradeoff between productivity and safety in critical engineering systems, {eid: 4344630824}>, <None, {eid: 85117476516}>, <Max-plus algebra and max-plus linear discrete-event systems: An introduction, {eid: 53149111136}>, <Modeling cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84155172767}>, <Knowledge-driven versus data-driven logics, {eid: 0037652855}>, <Model-driven performance prediction of systems of systems, {eid: 84979255879}>, <Mining traces of embedded software systems for insights, {eid: 85117442497}>, <None, {eid: 0003506085}>, <The relationship of system engineering to the project cycle, {eid: 1842637817}>, <None, {eid: 51749119047}>, <On the systematic use of budget-based design, {eid: 84878789010}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <Performance guarantees for scheduling algorithms, {eid: 0017925568}>, <Methods for evaluating and covering the design space during early design development, {eid: 9644281035}>, <Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems, {eid: 0023365727}>, <None, {eid: 84880914293}>, <Value and benefits of model-based systems engineering (mbse): Evidence from the literature, {eid: 85098450048}>, <A blueprint for system-level performance modeling of software-intensive embedded systems, {eid: 85027957685}>, <Checking metric temporal logic with trace, {eid: 85014968068}>, <Interface modeling for quality and resource management, {eid: 85198830744}>, <Performance engineering for industrial embedded data-processing systems, {eid: 84952333153}>, <None, {eid: 77953762003}>, <None, {eid: 84969745906}>, <None, {eid: 0003454649}>, <An approach for quantitative analysis of application-specific dataflow architectures, {eid: 0030679033}>, <Y-chart based system design: A discussion on approaches, {eid: 80055022911}>, <A brief account of runtime verification, {eid: 67349182373}>, <Model-based engineering in the embedded systems domain: An industrial survey on the state-of-practice, {eid: 84962207101}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <A survey of timing verification techniques for multi-core real-time systems, {eid: 85068038532}>, <Modelplex: Verified runtime validation of verified cyber-physical system models, {eid: 84994027707}>, <Simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems: State of the art and new trends, {eid: 85068546250}>, <Software passports for automated performance anomaly detection of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85071500236}>, <Calibration error bound estimation in performance modeling, {eid: 84890087572}>, <Exploring exploration: A tutorial introduction to embedded systems design space exploration, {eid: 85010008204}>, <Calibration of abstract performance models for system-level design space exploration, {eid: 46349106914}>, <None, {eid: 84892234592}>, <Online scheduling, {eid: 85035344127}>, <Driven by data or derived through physics?

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-09-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661
