This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes.","building information modeling, building lifecycle data, building permits, city information model, digital twins, GeoBIM, information model-based urban planning",,,,,,,,"<Automatic rule-based checking of building designs, {eid: 70349429622, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2009.07.002}>, <BIM for public authorities: Basic research for the standardized implementation of BIM in the building permit process, {eid: 85073033386, doi: 10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012102}>, <None, {eid: 85199664264}>, <A State-of-the-Art Review on the Integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS), {eid: 85014918203, doi: 10.3390/ijgi6020053}>, <From Geotechnical Data to GeoBIM Models: Testing Strategies for an Ex-Industrial Site in Turin, {eid: 85172807488, doi: 10.3390/buildings13092343}>, <BIM- and GIS-Based Life-Cycle-Assessment Framework for Enhancing Eco Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector, {eid: 85185888364, doi: 10.3390/buildings14020360}>, <An integrated building information modeling (BIM)-based lifecycle-oriented framework for sustainable building design, {eid: 85139162343, doi: 10.1108/CI-02-2021-0011}>, <Asset Information Model Management-Based GIS/BIM Integration in Facility Management Contract, {eid: 85189030595, doi: 10.3390/su16062495}>, <None, {eid: 38649094993}>, <Building Information Modeling: Why?

The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This article reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modeling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS and to prove relevant attributes such as system safety in the presence of intelligent behaviors and uncertainties.","Additional Key Words and PhrasesAutonomous cyber-physical production systems,

Firstly, the development status of smart grid digital twins was investigated and summarized from typical architectures, key technologies, and application directions. Then, based on modern information technology, we proposed the architecture and deployment method of the intelligent substation digital twin system. The proposed system consists of a data collection layer, a model driven layer, and a twin application layer, which respectively elaborate on the specific content and advantages, and supplement the complete deployment method of the system. The intelligent substation digital twin system effectively promotes the digitization and intelligence of substations, providing a new construction and management mode, and has potential application prospects in promoting equipment status perception, deterioration trend analysis, and fault handling in the power industry.","digital twin, equipment status perception, intelligent substations, modern information technology",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85184990269}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <A digital twin-based approach for designing and multi-objective optimization of hollow glass production line, {eid: 85032451877}>, <Digital twin as enabler for an innovative digital shop floor management system in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at Reutlingen-University, {eid: 85020859111}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Toward a Digital Twin for real-Time geometry assurance in individualized production, {eid: 85018779245}>, <Design and testing of a modular SiC based power block, {eid: 85018331557}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A probabilistic graphical model foundation for enabling predictive digital twins at scale, {eid: 85115144191}>, <For a digital twin of the gridSiemens solution enables a single digital grid model of the Finnish power systemR/OL, {eid: 85064141464}>, <Analytic engine for the digital power plantR/OL, {eid: 85185003399}>, <Technology features of the new generation power system in China, {eid: 85051245830}>, <Short-Term prediction of electronic transformer error based on intelligent algorithms, {eid: 85091971791}>, <Challenges on coordinated planning of smart distribution networks driven by source-network-load evolution, {eid: 85084734526}>, <New issues and classification of power system stability with high shares of renewables and power electronics, {eid: 85101073118}>, <Key scientific issues and theoretical research framework for power systems with high proportion of renewable energy, {eid: 85021001702}>, <Five-dimension digital twin model and its ten applications, {eid: 85064443425}>, <Active compliance control system for intelligent inspection robot in power room, {eid: 85139383617}>, <Framework design and application prospect for digital twin virtual power plant system, {eid: 85160951924}>, <Concept, Architecture and Key Technologies of Digital Power Grids, {eid: 85137812162}>, <Survey on Characteristics, Architecture and Applications of Digital Twin Power Grid, {eid: 85149646782}>, <Application and implementation method of digital twin in electric equipment, {eid: 85107458545}>, <Development patterns and challenges of ubiquitous power internet of things, {eid: 85079544635}>, <Networked Closed-Loop Model for Smart On-Site Maintenance of Substation Equipment Using Mobile Networks, {eid: 85049325561}>, <Equivalent modeling of virtual synchronous generator based on data-driven method, {eid: 85079413045}>, <Overview on cyber-Attacks against cyber physical power system, {eid: 84987802574}>, <Typical application and prospect of digital twin technology in power grid operation, {eid: 85107412686}>, <Concepts, characteristics and prospects of application of digital twin in power system, {eid: 85124807412}>, <Application of digital twin assistant-system in state estimation for inverter dominated grid, {eid: 85095575749}>, <State evaluation of power transformer based on digital twin, {eid: 85078834715}>, <Wind power fluctuation smooth strategy based on digital twin hybrid energy storage, {eid: 85109478754}>, <A software platform for secondorder responsiveness power grid online analysis, {eid: 85091590535}>, <Digital twin framework and its application to power grid online analysis, {eid: 85077253897}>, <A digital twin approach for fault diagnosis in distributed photovoltaic systems, {eid: 85074215768}>, <State evaluation and fault prediction of distribution automation terminal equipment based on digital twins, {eid: 85128493248}>, <Detection method of interturn short-circuit faults in oilimmersed transformers based on fusion analysis of electrothermal characteristic, {eid: 85109474528}>, <None, {eid: 85185007561}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-27,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85184999334

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

Reaching Net Zero depends on datafication and digitisation as data on carbon emissions collected across assets’ lifecycle are important for neutralising them. This study aims to understand how technological ecosystems such as Digital Twins – that connect physical and digital artefacts – can support a Net Zero vision in the built environment, in an industry-agnostic way to transfer any relevant lessons from other sectors. The method is a systematic literature review that structures new knowledge on the topic. The study showed that environment sustainability has been an overused idea in scientific literature, yet rarely operationalised. A scarcity of studies utilising the potential of digital twins for Net Zero was found. The emergent themes are: overreliance on technocratic solutions at the expense of systems thinking, proliferation of renewable sources and misunderstandings regarding visualisation necessity, and showing pathways for future DT system design for Net Zero.","Digital twins, model-based systems engineering, net zero, review, sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Shades of grey: Guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 84964407503}>, <Imagining construction’s digital future.

A digital twin is defined as the virtual representation of a physical asset that collects and sends real-time information. A digital twin collects data from the physical asset in real-time and uses this data to create a virtual model of the physical object. Its functionality depends on the bi-directional coordination of data between the physical and virtual models. This is likened to cyber-physical systems, which seek to provide bi-directional coordination between the physical and virtual worlds. While digital twins have found applications in the various industrial sectors such as aerospace, manufacturing, and industrial engineering, their applications in the construction industry are relatively limited. Although some level of progress has been made in the construction industry with the application of a digital twin, it still lags in other sectors. Virtual models of constructed facilities are developed and used to plan and construct the actual facility, with changes in the physical facility being automatically reflected in the virtual model based on real-time data and vice-versa. The digital twin shows promising possibilities in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. This paper reviews the development and implementation of digital twin technology in the construction industry and compares its use with other industries while assessing the benefits of DT to the construction industry. A systematic literature review including a thematic analysis was employed to address the purpose of this study. Limitations associated with the existing and emerging applications are also identified. It concludes by highlighting the importance of DT applications in the construction sector.","Bi-directional, Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Analytics, Digital Twin, Real-Time, Virtual Model",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916}>, <None, {eid: 85129240368}>, <Prioritizing object types for modeling existing industrial facilities, {eid: 85054099413}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Integration of BIM and the Physical Construction, Engineering, Construction, and Architectural Management: Special Issue on Advanced ICT and Smart Systems for Innovative Engineering, {eid: 84942110767}>, <Mechanisms for Bi-directional Coordination between Virtual Design and the Physical Construction, {eid: 85129249130}>, <An RTLS-based Approach to Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Design and Construction, {eid: 84872813621, doi: 10.1155/2012/596845}>, <Scenarios for Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Construction, {eid: 84880055872}>, <Towards next-generation cyber-physical systems and digital twins for construction, {eid: 85112133397, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2021.027}>, <Thematic Analysis: A critical review of its process and evaluation, {eid: 84978175524}>, <Managing health care organizations: where professionalism meets complexity science, {eid: 0033995008}>, <Towards a Cyber-Physical Systems Approach to Construction, {eid: 77956305933}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Development for Construction Applications, {eid: 85112129345, doi: 10.1007/s42524-020-0130-4}>, <None, {eid: 85112719218}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958}>, <Digital twin creates the blueprint for future smart buildings, {eid: 85129235765}>, <Patient flow modeling and performance analysis of healthcare delivery processes in hospitals: A review and reflections, {eid: 84912522613}>, <Next-generation digital twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <None, {eid: 0003482307}>, <BIM-Based Progress Monitoring, {eid: 85063561288}>, <Built environment digital twinning, {eid: 85108350238}>, <Innovative Thinker -

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.","Digital shadows, Industrial internet of things, Internet of production, World wide lab",,,,,,,,"<Deploying fog computing in industrial internet of things and industry 4. 0, {eid: 85049803971}>, <Peeking inside the black-box: A survey on explainable artificial intelligence, {eid: 85053352477}>, <A framework for explainable concept drift detection in process mining, {eid: 85115178805}>, <Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, {eid: 85077515399}>, <Blockchain-based privacy preservation for supply chains supporting lightweight multi-hop information accountability, {eid: 85100453781}>, <Ironies of automation, {eid: 0020843464}>, <The Physical Internet, {eid: 84923153575}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The ironies of automation: Still going strong at 30?, {eid: 84875427820}>, <A conceptual model for digital shadows in industry and its application, {eid: 85118142665}>, <Edge cloud as an enabler for distributed AI in industrial IoT applications: The experience of the IoTwins project, {eid: 85075928612}>, <None, {eid: 85054023050}>, <Model-driven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <How context and design shape human-robot trust and attributions, {eid: 85097184876}>, <A digital twin for production planning based on cyber-physical systems: A case study for a cyber-physical system-based creation of a digital twin, {eid: 85065427421}>, <Domain-specific language for sensors in the internet of production, {eid: 85165962517}>, <None, {eid: 84995466560}>, <The road to european digital sovereignty with gaia-x and IDSA, {eid: 85103448059}>, <What happens when decision support systems fail?-The importance of usability on performance in erroneous systems, {eid: 85062364168}>, <None, {eid: 80054884442}>, <Towards a continuously improving composites manufacturing by employing the internet of production, {eid: 85124263660}>, <Process prediction with digital twins, {eid: 85121810059}>, <Challenges in automotive software engineering, {eid: 34247127701}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Holarchy for line-less mobile assembly systems operation in the context of the internet of production, {eid: 85106412122}>, <None, {eid: 84946229140}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <A compositional framework for systematic modeling language reuse, {eid: 85096955321}>, <Reducing complexity with simplicity-usability methods for industry 4. 0, {eid: 84986543578}>, <None, {eid: 85127453330}>, <Towards low latency industrial robot control in programmable data planes, {eid: 85091982375}>, <Goal-oriented modelling of relations and dependencies in data marketplaces, {eid: 85049320311}>, <Concern-oriented language development: Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 85112723943}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <Industry 4. 0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <None, {eid: 0003939293}>, <Easing the conscience with OPC UA: An internet-wide study on insecure deployments, {eid: 85097285990}>, <Missed opportunities: Measuring the untapped TLS support in the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85133169932}>, <Transparent end-to-end security for publish/subscribe communication in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85107432740}>, <Towards sustainable systems engineering-integrating tools via component and connector architectures, {eid: 85127185370}>, <Model-driven systems engineering for virtual product design, {eid: 85075936044}>, <Towards a modeldriven architecture for interactive digital twin cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <Hybrid intelligence, {eid: 85069455009}>, <What does explainable AI really mean?

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.","Cloud robotics, Industry 40, model-driven, reference

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-09-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud/edge computing integration. This work sets out to be a guide to the status of DT development and application in today’s academic and industrial environment.","Business model, Cyber-physical system, Digital Twin, Product lifecycle management, Review",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.051}>, <PSS business model conceptualization and application, {eid: 85027857673, doi: 10.1080/09537287.2017.1363924}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006}>, <A flexible data schema and system architecture for the virtualization of manufacturing machines (VMM), {eid: 85031730395, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.10.003}>, <Cyber-physical system framework for measurement and analysis of physical activities, {eid: 85063520336, doi: 10.3390/electronics8020248}>, <Sustainable and flexible industrial human machine interfaces to support adaptable applications in the Industry 4.0 paradigm, {eid: 85061078981, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1572932}>, <Business models as models, {eid: 77952564431, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.02.005}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85054319262, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1526324}>, <Warehouse management system customization and information availability in 3pl companies: A decision-support tool, {eid: 85053068565, doi: 10.1108/imds-01-2018-0033}>, <Radial basis functions update of digital models on actual manufactured shapes, {eid: 85059948011, doi: 10.1115/1.4041680}>, <Digital twin driven human–robot collaborative assembly, {eid: 85064665252, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2019.04.011}>, <Customer experience challenges: Bringing together digital, physical and social realms, {eid: 85053283291, doi: 10.1108/josm-04-2018-0113}>, <From the cyber-physical system to the digital twin: The process development for behaviour modelling of a cyber guided vehicle in M2M logic, {eid: 85040447784}>, <Digital Twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524, doi: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00031}>, <Digital twins to enhance the integration of ergonomics in the workplace design, {eid: 85061523003, doi: 10.1016/j.ergon.2019.02.001}>, <From strategy to business models and onto tactics, {eid: 77952561844, doi: 10.1016/j.lrp.2010.01.004}>, <A supervised machine learning approach to data-driven simulation of resilient supplier selection in digital manufacturing, {eid: 85063342587, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.03.004}>, <Cyber-physical integration for moving digital factories forward towards smart manufacturing: a survey, {eid: 85045842061, doi: 10.1007/s00170-018-2001-2}>, <Cyber-physical systems: A case study of development for manufacturing industry, {eid: 85028566642, doi: 10.1504/ijcat.2017.10006845}>, <The relation between systematic reviews and practice guidelines methods for developing guidelines: An overview, {eid: 0030761938, doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-127-3-199708010-00006}>, <Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling, {eid: 85067817812, doi: 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.05.045}>, <Part data integration in the shop floor digital twin: Mobile and cloud technologies to enable a manufacturing execution system, {eid: 85044527201, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.02.002}>, <An open source approach to the design and implementation of digital twins for smart manufacturing, {eid: 85064532610, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2019.1599436}>, <Meet Virtual Singapore, the city’s 3D digital twin, {eid: 85086996479}>, <Emergence of digital twins - is this the march of reason?, {eid: 85048741165, doi: 10.24840/2183-0606_005.003_0003}>, <Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance, {eid: 84869487494, doi: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037}>, <Digital twins probe into food cooling and biochemical quality changes for reducing losses in refrigerated supply chains, {eid: 85070210024, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.002}>, <Fiber orientation measurement from mesoscale CT scans of prepreg platelet molded composites, {eid: 85052228223, doi: 10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.08.024}>, <BIOSOARM: A bio-inspired self-organising architecture for manufacturing cyber-physical shopfloors, {eid: 84986268581, doi: 10.1007/s10845-016-1258-2}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1566661}>, <Ergonomic rationalization of lighting in the working environment.

There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.","Digital Twin, Virtual

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.","Artificial intelligence (AI),

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELS’17), IEEE, pp 281–291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.","Industry 4.0, Modeling languages, Smart

All rights reserved.When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.","Artificial intelligence, Digital twin, Human-computer interaction, Internet of things, Machine learning,

Herbert Smith Centre, University of New Brunswick>",,"© 2013 IEEE.Digital twinning is one of the top ten technology trends in the last couple of years, due to its high applicability in the industrial sector. The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.","artificial intelligence, big data, Digital twin, industry 40, machine

A comprehensive review of the existing literature is conducted to address this, offering an up-to-date analysis of relevant content in this field. The methodology employed is a systematic literature review using the Primo multi-search tool, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The selection criteria focused on English studies published between 2012 and 2024, resulting in 201 highly relevant papers. These papers were categorized into seven groups: (a) air transportation, (b) railway transportation, (c) land transportation (road), (d) in-house logistics, (e) water and intermodal transportation, (f) supply chain operation, and (g) other applications. A notable strength of this study is its use of diverse scientific databases facilitated by the multi-search tool. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was performed, revealing the evolution of DT applications over the past decade and identifying key areas such as predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and decision-making processes. This study highlights the varied levels of adoption across different transport sectors and underscores promising areas for future development, particularly in underrepresented domains like supply chains and water transport. Additionally, this paper identifies significant research gaps, including integration challenges, real-time data processing, and standardization needs. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on enhancing predictive diagnostics, automating maintenance processes, and optimizing inventory management. This study also outlines a framework for DT in transportation systems, detailing key components and functionalities essential for effective maintenance management. The findings provide a roadmap for future innovations and improvements in DT applications within the transportation industry. This study ends with conclusions and future research directions.","air transportation, digital twin, in-house logistics, land transportation, operation and maintenance, PRISMA guidelines, railway transportation, supply chains operation, systematic review analysis, transportation system, water and intermodal transportation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85205242173}>, <The Digital Revolution of the Transportation Industry, {eid: 85159144901, doi: 10.1016/j.trpro.2023.02.014}>, <Practical Application of Digital Twins for Transportation Asset Data Management: Case Example of a Safety Hardware Asset, {eid: 85189142458, doi: 10.1177/03611981241231804}>, <Interaction between a Human and an AGV System in a Shared Workspace—A Literature Review Identifying Research Areas, {eid: 85184674605, doi: 10.3390/su16030974}>, <Risk Reduction in Transportation Systems: The Role of Digital Twins According to a Bibliometric-Based Literature Review, {eid: 85191388433, doi: 10.3390/su16083212}>, <A Systematic Literature Review of the Predictive Maintenance from Transportation Systems Aspect, {eid: 85141669124, doi: 10.3390/su142114536}>, <Environmental Sustainability in Maintenance Management of Public Transport Systems: Literature Review, {eid: 85061789158, doi: 10.1109/IEEM.2018.8607535}>, <Onboard Condition Monitoring Sensors, Systems and Techniques for Freight Railway Vehicles: A Review, {eid: 85054665564, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2018.2875160}>, <Condition Monitoring Systems in the Railway Industry BT—Advances in Asset Management and Condition Monitoring, {eid: 85091295854}>, <A Survey on Audio-Video Based Defect Detection Through Deep Learning in Railway Maintenance, {eid: 85132784354, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183102}>, <Perspectives on Railway Axle Bearing Condition Monitoring, {eid: 85062626115, doi: 10.1177/0954409719831822}>, <Towards the Internet of Smart Trains: A Review on Industrial IoT-Connected Railways, {eid: 85021198458, doi: 10.3390/s17061457}>, <An Approach to the Legal Requirements Regarding Railway Transport Safety Monitoring in the European Union, {eid: 85062262700, doi: 10.3846/transport.2019.8528}>, <Offline and Online Measurement of the Geometries of Train Wheelsets: A Review, {eid: 85138451082, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2022.3205691}>, <Prognostics and Health Management: Current State-of-the-Art for Optimizing Aircraft Structural Maintenance, {eid: 85048856292, doi: 10.1109/EuroSimE.2018.8369957}>, <Preventive Maintenance of Transport Vehicles Is It Improving Production Stability of a Smelter?

Digital twins are a powerful consequence of digital transformation. In fact, they have been applied to many industries to enhance operations, predict needs, improve decision making, or optimize performance, even though the definition of digital twins is still evolving. However, their impact on the software industry is still limited. Thus, this work aims to analyze the current adoption of digital twins in the software industry as a potential path to integrate them into application lifecycle management. To achieve this objective, first, the significant characteristics of current digital twins are analyzed in their application to manufacturing to understand how the knowledge and the lessons learned can be transferred to the software industry. Second, a systematic literature review was conducted on Scopus, the Web of Science, and the ScienceDirect database. The literature review revealed 93 documents after data screening and cleaning 251 initial documents. Our main findings are that digital twins are already influencing and will significantly affect the software industry, revolutionizing various aspects of the software development lifecycle. This study tackles what identifies a digital twin in the software industry, the specific domains and areas where they can be applied in the software lifecycle, and the proposed approaches explored to build digital twins for developing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. Finally, this study proposes some guidelines for building digital twins in the context of application lifecycle management. Determining an appropriate roadmap shortly is essential to achieve a widespread applicability to building suitable digital twins and preparing organizations for the software industry.","digital transformation, digital twin, software development, software engineering, software industry",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84962306691}>, <Digital Twins and Cyber–Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison, {eid: 85068798049, doi: 10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014}>, <Digital Twin Perspective of Fourth Industrial and Healthcare Revolution, {eid: 85125714236, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156062}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <A Critical View on PLM/ALM Convergence in Practice and Research, {eid: 85029874943, doi: 10.1016/j.protcy.2016.08.052}>, <PLM/ALM Integration with The Asset Administration Shell, {eid: 85100760400, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2020.11.040}>, <A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins, {eid: 85135797712, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2022.111361}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Steering Representations-Towards a Critical Understanding of Digital Twins, {eid: 85116856610, doi: 10.1007/s13347-021-00484-1}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems: A Literature Review, {eid: 85060302764, doi: 10.19044/esj.2017.v13n36p52}>, <The challenges, approaches, and used techniques of CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0: A literature review, {eid: 85101138866, doi: 10.1007/s00170-020-06572-4}>, <Mist and Edge Computing Cyber-Physical Human-Centered Systems for Industry 5.0: A Cost-Effective IoT Thermal Imaging Safety System, {eid: 85141630669, doi: 10.3390/s22218500}>, <Digital Twin-Driven Human Robot Collaboration Using a Digital Human, {eid: 85120820519, doi: 10.3390/s21248266}>, <Digital-twin-based testing for cyber–physical systems: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85145973213, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2022.107145}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759, doi: 10.1016/j.compind.2021.103469}>, <A collaborative network of digital twins for anomaly detection applications of complex systems, {eid: 85137654694}>, <Digital twin-enabled automated anomaly detection and bottleneck identification in complex manufacturing systems using a multi-agent approach, {eid: 85147847425, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2023.02.008}>, <Digital Twin: Empowering Enterprises Towards a System-of-Systems Approach, {eid: 85075914851, doi: 10.1007/s12599-019-00624-0}>, <Quality-Oriented Digital Twin Modelling Method for Manufacturing Processes Based on A Multi-Agent Architecture, {eid: 85099833723, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2020.10.044}>, <Product Design for Matrix-Structured Manufacturing Systems, {eid: 85133539751, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.270}>, <Digital Twin (DT) based methodology to support effective design of industrial production lines, {eid: 85163840712, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.390}>, <Data Modeling and ML.

In this position paper, we argue that the second enabling pillar towards this vision is the increasing power of computers and algorithms to learn, reason, and build the 'digital twin' of a patient. Computational models are boosting the capacity to draw diagnosis and prognosis, and future treatments will be tailored not only to current health status and data, but also to an accurate projection of the pathways to restore health by model predictions. The early steps of the digital twin in the area of cardiovascular medicine are reviewed in this article, together with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We emphasize the synergies between mechanistic and statistical models in accelerating cardiovascular research and enabling the vision of precision medicine.","Artificial intelligence, Computational modelling, Digital twin, Precision medicine",,,,,,,,"<Precision medicine in cardiology, {eid: 84976448008}>, <From genetics to smart watches: developments in precision cardiology, {eid: 85058940139}>, <A new initiative on precision medicine, {eid: 84923762812}>, <Promises, promises, and precision medicine, {eid: 85062423215}>, <Precision medicine vs preventive medicine, {eid: 85060593774}>, <Evolution beyond neo-Darwinism: a new conceptual framework, {eid: 84924264935}>, <Integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling-perspectives, challenges, and opportunities in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences, {eid: 85135599036}>, <Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data, {eid: 85015707925}>, <Teaching cardiovascular medicine to machines, {eid: 85050918165}>, <Length-dependent tension in the failing heart and the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 78751507006}>, <Differentiating electromechanical from non-electrical substrates of mechanical discoordination to identify responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy, {eid: 84955475978}>, <SMOD - Data Augmentation Based on Statistical Models of Deformation to Enhance Segmentation in 2D Cine Cardiac MRI, {eid: 85067176547, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-21949-9-39}>, <Machine-learning integration of complex echocardiographic patterns and clinical parameters from cohorts and trials, {eid: 85092288720, doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehz745.0147}>, <Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?, {eid: 85047537837}>, <Big data analytics to improve cardiovascular care: promise and challenges, {eid: 84961393205}>, <Artificial intelligence in cardiovascular imaging: JACC state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85062806342}>, <Computational models in cardiology, {eid: 85055544890}>, <Enabling precision cardiology through multiscale biology and systems medicine, {eid: 85033597806}>, <Recent developments in using mechanistic cardiac modelling for drug safety evaluation, {eid: 84959289711}>, <None, {eid: 0004110543}>, <Computational modelling of 1D blood flow with variable mechanical properties and its application to the simulation of wave propagation in the human arterial system, {eid: 0242497983}>, <Random forest for automatic assessment of heart failure severity in a telemonitoring scenario, {eid: 84886524376}>, <Gaussian process robust regression for noisy heart rate data, {eid: 50049125217}>, <Variability in pulmonary vein electrophysiology and fibrosis determines arrhythmia susceptibility and dynamics, {eid: 85048201970}>, <Patient-specific computer modeling to predict aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, {eid: 84959872264}>, <Patient-specific cardiovascular computational modeling: diversity of personalization and challenges, {eid: 85049612985}>, <The role of computational modeling and simulation in the total product life cycle of peripheral vascular devices, {eid: 85018379109}>, <Multi-modality image-based computational analysis of haemodynamics in aortic dissection, {eid: 84944603147}>, <""Virtual"" (computed) fractional flow reserve, {eid: 84937739100}>, <The estimation of patient-specific cardiac diastolic functions from clinical measurements, {eid: 84883865079}>, <Left ventricular diastolic myocardial stiffness and end-diastolic myofibre stress in human heart failure using personalised biomechanical analysis, {eid: 85049665722}>, <A finite-element approach to the direct computation of relative cardiovascular pressure from time-resolved MR velocity data, {eid: 84861976269}>, <Non-invasive pressure difference estimation from PC-MRI using the work-energy equation, {eid: 84942257432}>, <Beyond Bernoulli: improving the accuracy and precision of non-invasive estimation of peak pressure drops, {eid: 85009860323}>, <Diagnostic performance of noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography in suspected coronary artery disease, {eid: 84896972430}>, <Noninvasive fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CT angiography, {eid: 84944041048}>, <Non-invasive fractional flow reserve using computed tomographic angiography: where are we now and where are we going?, {eid: 85024487439}>, <Advancing regulatory science with computational modeling for medical devices at the FDAs Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories, {eid: 85062702939, doi: 10.3389/fmed.2018.00241}>, <Noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms: a feasibility report noninvasive panoramic mapping of human atrial fibrillation mechanisms.

The ISO 23247 standard proposes a reference architecture for digital twins in manufacturing, including an entity-based reference model and a functional view specified in terms of functional entities. During our experience with projects in the field, we noticed that standards, and in particular the ISO 23247 standard, are not completely followed. In this paper, we analyse to what extent digital twin architectures documented in the literature are aligned with the reference architecture presented in the ISO 23247 standard. We achieved this through a mixed-methods research methodology that includes the analysis of 29 digital twin architectures in the manufacturing domain resulting from a systematic literature review of 140 peer-reviewed studies, a survey with 33 respondents, and four semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews. On the basis of our findings, practitioners and researchers can reflect, discuss, and plan actions for future research and development activities.","Digital Twin, ISO 23247, Reference Architecture,
