Synthetic data aims to solve this issue by generating artificial data that resembles an original dataset in structural and statistical characteristics, but omits sensitive information. For mobility data, a large number of corresponding models have been proposed in the past decade. This systematic review provides a structured comparative overview of the current state of this heterogeneous, active field of research. A special focus is put on the applicability of the reviewed models in practice.},

abstract = {Today, cloud computation offloading may not be an appropriate solution for delay-sensitive applications due to the long distance between end-devices and remote datacenters. In addition, offloading to a remote cloud can consume bandwidth and dramatically increase costs. However, end-devices such as sensors, cameras, and smartphones have limited computing and storage capacity. Processing tasks on such battery-powered and energy-constrained devices becomes even more complex. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called Edge Computing (EC) emerged nearly a decade ago to bring computing resources closer to end-devices. Here, edge servers located between the end-device and the remote cloud perform user tasks. Recently, several new computing paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) have emerged to complement Cloud Computing (CC) and EC. Although these paradigms are heterogeneous, they can further reduce energy consumption and task response time, especially for delay-sensitive applications. Computation offloading is a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. A significant part of previous research in this field is devoted to Machine Learning (ML) methods. One of the essential types of ML is Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which an agent learns how to make the best decision using the experiences gained from the environment. This article provides a systematic review of the widely used RL approaches in computation offloading. It covers research in complementary paradigms such as mobile cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and the Internet of Things. We explain the reasons for using various RL methods in computation offloading from a technical point of view. This analysis includes both binary offloading and partial offloading techniques. For each method, the essential elements of RL and the characteristics of the environment are discussed regarding the most important criteria. Research challenges and Future trends are also mentioned.},

Data quality in these systems can deteriorate due to sensor failures or uncertain operating environments. Our objective is to summarize and assess the research efforts that address data quality in data-centric CPS/IoT industrial applications. We systematically review the state-of-the-art data quality techniques for CPS and IoT in Industry 4.0 through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. We pose three research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria for primary studies, and extract and synthesize data from these studies to answer our research questions. Our most significant results are (i) the list of data quality issues, their sources, and application domains, (ii) the best practices and metrics for managing data quality, (iii) the software engineering solutions employed to manage data quality, and (iv) the state of the data quality techniques (data repair, cleaning, and monitoring) in the application domains. The results of our SLR can help researchers obtain an overview of existing data quality issues, techniques, metrics, and best practices.

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, i.e., Industry 4.0, is associated with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which are entities integrating hardware (e.g., smart sensors and actuators connected through the Industrial Internet of Things) together with control and analytics software used to drive and support decisions at several levels. The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This article reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modeling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS and to prove relevant attributes such as system safety in the presence of intelligent behaviors and uncertainties.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.},

abstract = {The envisioned sixth-generation (6G) networks anticipate robust support for diverse applications, including massive machine-type communications, ultra-reliable low-latency communications, and enhanced mobile broadband. Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a key technology capable of intelligently reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, thereby enhancing overall network performance. Traditional optimization techniques face limitations in meeting the stringent performance requirements of 6G networks due to the intricate and dynamic nature of the wireless environment. Consequently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed within the IRS framework to optimize wireless system performance. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest research in DL-aided IRS models, covering optimal beamforming, resource allocation control, channel estimation and prediction, signal detection, and system deployment. The focus is on presenting promising solutions within the constraints of different hardware configurations. The survey explores challenges, opportunities, and open research issues in DL-aided IRS, considering emerging technologies such as digital twins (DTs), computer vision (CV), blockchain, network function virtualization (NFC), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), software-defined networking (SDN), mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Practical design issues associated with these enabling technologies are also discussed, providing valuable insights into the current state and future directions of this evolving field.},

abstract = {In recent years, the notion of “the right to be forgotten” (RTBF) has become a crucial aspect of data privacy for digital trust and AI safety, requiring the provision of mechanisms that support the removal of personal data of individuals upon their requests. Consequently, machine unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention which allows an ML model to selectively eliminate identifiable information. Evolving from MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within federated learning (FL) settings, which empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client. Nevertheless, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges necessitate a tailored design when developing FU algorithms. While various concepts and numerous federated unlearning schemes exist in this field, the unified workflow and tailored design of FU are not yet well understood. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques and methodologies in FU providing an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluating existing federated unlearning algorithms, and reviewing optimizations tailored to federated learning. Additionally, it discusses practical applications and assesses their limitations. Finally, it outlines promising directions for future research.},

The realm of IIoT includes smart sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems (DCS), embedded devices, supervisory control, and data acquisition systems—all produced by manufacturers for different purposes and with different data structures and formats; designed according to different standards and made to follow different protocols. In this sea of incompatibility, how can we flexibly acquire these heterogeneous data, and how can we uniformly structure them to suit thousands of different applications? In this article, we survey the four pillars of information science that enable collaborative data access in an IIoT—standardization, data acquisition, data fusion, and scalable architecture—to provide an up-to-date audit of current research in the field. Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures, reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to support heterogeneous requirements. The article also concludes with an overview of the frontier researches and emerging technologies for supporting or challenging data access from the aspects of 5G, machine learning, blockchain, and semantic web.},

Despite this need, transparency and explainability is, to the best of our knowledge, mostly overlooked in VA robotics literature or is not considered explicitly. In this article, we aim to present and examine the most recent contributions to the VA literature concerning transparency and explainability. In addition, we propose a way of thinking about VA by breaking these two concepts down based on: the mission of the human-robot team; who the stakeholder is; what needs to be made transparent or explained; why they need it; and how it can be achieved.

In this paper, we conducted a thorough review of the related works, following the development context and deeply mining the key technologies behind FL from the perspectives of theory and application. Specifically, we first classify the existing works in FL architecture based on the network topology of FL systems with detailed analysis and summarization. Next, we abstract the current application problems, summarize the general techniques and frame the application problems into the general paradigm of FL base models. Moreover, we provide our proposed solutions for model training via FL. We have summarized and analyzed the existing FedOpt algorithms, and deeply revealed the algorithmic development principles of many first-order algorithms in depth, proposing a more generalized algorithm design framework. With the instantiation of these frameworks, FedOpt algorithms can be simply developed. As privacy and security is the fundamental requirement in FL, we provide the existing attack scenarios and the defense methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first tier to review the theoretical methodology and propose our strategies since there are very few works surveying the theoretical approaches.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},

abstract = {Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not yet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the metaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.},
