  abstract={Since its first introduction in 2002, the interest in the concept of "Digital Twins" has grown exponentially among researchers and industry practitioners. An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.},

  abstract={With the combination of software and physical devices into so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged to handle the resulting complexity and efficiently connect software to physical devices, the so-called physical twins (PTs). While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.},

  pages={32190-32212},
  abstract={This literature review extends and contributes to research on the development of data-driven optimal control. Previous reviews have documented the development of model-based and data-driven control in isolation and have not critically reviewed reinforcement learning approaches for adaptive data-driven optimal control frameworks. The presented review discusses the development of model-based to model-free adaptive controllers, highlighting the use of data in control frameworks. In data-driven control frameworks, reinforcement learning methods may be used to derive the optimal policy for dynamical systems. Attractive characteristics of these methods include not requiring a mathematical model of complex systems, their inherent adaptive control capabilities, being an unsupervised learning technique and their decision-making abilities, which are both an advantage and motivation behind this approach. This review considers previous reviews on these topics, including recent work on data-driven control methods. In addition, this review shows the use of data to derive system dynamics, determine the control policy using feedback information, and tune fixed controllers. Furthermore, the review summarises various data-driven methods and their corresponding characteristics. Finally, the review provides a taxonomy, a timeline and a concise narrative of the development of model-based to model-free data-driven adaptive control and underlines the limitations of these techniques due to the lack of theoretical analysis. Areas of further work include theoretical analysis on stability and robustness for data-driven control systems, explainability of black-box policy learning techniques and an evaluation of the impact of the extension of system simulators to include digital twins.},

  abstract={This article studies the architecture and deployment of a digital twin system for intelligent substations. Firstly, the development status of smart grid digital twins was investigated and summarized from typical architectures, key technologies, and application directions. Then, based on modern information technology, we proposed the architecture and deployment method of the intelligent substation digital twin system. The proposed system consists of a data collection layer, a model driven layer, and a twin application layer, which respectively elaborate on the specific content and advantages, and supplement the complete deployment method of the system. The intelligent substation digital twin system effectively promotes the digitization and intelligence of substations, providing a new construction and management mode, and has potential application prospects in promoting equipment status perception, deterioration trend analysis, and fault handling in the power industry.},

  number={},
  pages={166-171},
  abstract={Modern-day software is increasingly developed by domain experts. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) help them to bridge the conceptual gap between the problem and the solution domain. Engineering these languages is complex, as it requires comprehensive white-box knowledge of constituents of DSLs, i.e., syntax and semantics, and their composition and realization in respective technological spaces of language workbenches. For efficient language engineering reusing existing languages by composition is essential. For this purpose, various language composition and variability mechanisms have been developed. However, in the literature, there exists no approach enabling systematic language reuse holistically, i.e., including syntax and semantics, in a black-box fashion. We propose an approach for the systematic component-oriented reuse of DSLs (SCOLaR) that supports the integrated reuse of syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics via black-box language components that are composable along their interface in a language family. We implemented a prototypical version of our solution with the MontiCore language workbench, that supports embedding and aggregation of grammar-based languages with translational semantics realized with code-generators. In the future, we plan to improve our implementation with the support of other language workbenches and to provide a comprehensive evaluation with a series of case studies. With our work, we aim to advance the field of software language engineering by providing a novel method for black-box language reuse capturing syntax and semantics definitions for textual external, translational DSLs. This paper outlines our approach by stating the problem, motivating our research question, and proposing our solution, our plan for evaluation, and presenting expected contributions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={2},
  number={},
  pages={135-147},
  abstract={The rising system complexity of modern products requires new approaches within model-based systems engineering to manage the upcoming challenges. System development is characterized by a wide variety of decisions to be made. These situations have to be modeled within a holistic system model to ensure traceability. Motivated by lack of a comprehensive overview of approaches, this article presents the results of a systematic literature study focusing on utilizing system models in decision-making. By that, the existing gap between theoretical foundations and implementation in practical use is intended to be closed through providing practitioners insights to relevant approaches. Apart from that, researchers are enabled to derive new research directions from the corpus of literature. Relevant reports use different diagrams to model a decision situation or its processes and reuse those diagrams as well as their contents to feed methods from multicriteria decision-making. By that, new objectives are added to those diagrams, namely to enable extensive decision-making, which is understood as their utilization. Thus, this article provides an overview of applied decision-making approaches, languages used to model the decision context, and the use of external tools, where the decision-making algorithms are executed. The findings show that the majority of existing approaches only cover certain aspects of the decision-making situation in the system model and especially the formalization of the decision-making process is hardly considered. Besides that, future research fields including the analysis of potentials coming along with the introduction of systems modeling language v2 and especially its API are identified.},

  abstract={In 2002, Grieves defined the concept of the digital twin as a virtual instance of physical assets capable of continuously mirroring them. Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.},

  abstract={In this work, a brief survey of simulation methods used to create digital twins (DTs) or assist DTs in the automotive, aviation, and marine industries is presented. The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Effective communication of patient clinical and care information between pre-hospital services and Emergency Departments (EDs) is crucial for the rapid and effective treatment of patients, potentially saving lives. Recent research indicates a frequent lack of patient data metrics, such as vital signs, which represents a potential limitation in the comprehensiveness of handoffs received by ED physicians from pre-hospital providers. To address this challenge, we propose a solution that utilizes a patient's digital twin and permissioned blockchain technology to ensure complete, real-time, secure, and shareable access to patients' vital signs and other data metrics for Emergency Departments. This solution seeks to answer the following questions: Which data model for the digital twin best represents the patient during transport, meeting the requirements of the receiving facility? How can patient digital twin data, including the history of clinical information and patient care, be shared in real-time with the receiving facility? How can EHR-compliant digital twin data be produced to satisfy the reconciliation between the Patient Digital Twin (PDT) and the Electronic Health Record (EHR)? Method: We conducted a comprehensive literature review and a series of interviews with both pre-hospital and hospital care providers to identify the problem and develop a model based on it. To address the second question, we designed an architecture that includes all parties in the care team, during and after the transport. For the third question, we explored NEMSIS data exchange standards and a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module. Objective: Our goal is to improve the survivability of patients in emergency care through secure, effective, and real-time sharing of patient metric data between Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Emergency Departments or Trauma Centers. This approach also aims to reduce the waiting time for patients upon arrival at the receiving facility.},

  abstract={The development of cyber-physical systems is heavily relying on model-driven approaches. After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.},

This paper reports on bibliometric literature analysis of MBSE of IoT.

We used Elsevier’s Scopus database to find relevant publications from January 2018 to December 2022. Using publication citation ranking and other factors (e.g., publication venues), we selected 110 articles and then analyzed them using BibExcel and VOSviewer software tools. With a modest decline in 2021, this analysis shows an overall increase in publications during the time period. A thematic analysis of the abstracts revealed a strong focus on the introduction of reference architectures and integration of MBSE with business and management methodologies like Agile and BPMN 2.0. Model-driven engineering and machine learning techniques are essential among the enablers for realization of complex heterogeneous IoT systems in the realm of Industry 4.0. We highlight these findings to better understand and meet the enduring challenge of scaling MBSE of IoT across diverse sectors like health, manufacturing, and transportation.},

  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive survey of machine learning, deep learning, and digital twin technology methods for predicting and managing the battery state of health in electric vehicles. Battery state of health estimation is essential for optimizing the battery usage, performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles. Estimating the state of health of a battery is a complex undertaking due to its dependency on multiple factors. These factors include battery characteristics such as type, chemistry, size, temperature, current, voltage, impedance, cycle number, and driving pattern. There are drawbacks to traditional methods, such as experimental and model-based approaches, in terms of accuracy, complexity, expense, and viability for real-time applications. By employing a variety of algorithms to discover the nonlinear and dynamic link between the battery parameters and the state of health, data-driven techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven digital twin technologies can get beyond these restrictions. Data-driven methods can also incorporate physics and domain knowledge to improve the explainability and interpretability of the results. This paper reviews the latest advancements and challenges of using data-driven techniques for battery state of health estimation and management in electric vehicles. The paper also discusses the future directions and opportunities for further research and development in this field. The survey scope spans publications from the year 2021 to 2023.},

  abstract={To realize the great potential of the intelligent transportation infrastructure, the investment in the transportation infrastructure in the intelligent transportation system should be rationally planned. Firstly, the application status of cutting-edge Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model in transportation infrastructure efficiency evaluation is analyzed, and based on this, a DEA model of transportation infrastructure efficiency evaluation under Digital Twins technology is established. Secondly, with the transportation infrastructure of 12 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province from 2005 to 2020 as the research object, the Digital Twins DEA model and the traditional Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) model are used to estimate the efficiency of transportation infrastructure in 12 cities. Finally, the traffic flow data of a certain road section in Zhenjiang City (J11 City) is simulated and predicted by using the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) traffic flow prediction model. The results show that the average efficiency of the 12 cities estimated by the DEA model based on the Digital Twins is 0.7083, the average efficiency of the 12 cities estimated by the SFA model is 0.6445, and there are significant differences in the efficiency rankings of the cities. Compared with the actual efficiency, the established Digital Twins DEA model is more reasonable for the calculation of transportation infrastructure efficiency. The results of the LSTM traffic flow prediction model show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the LSTM model is 24.29, the Root Mean Square Error (RSME) is 0.1186, and the Mean Absolute Perce (MAPE) is 17.78, which are all lower than other models. Compared with other models, the proposed LSTM-based traffic flow prediction model is more accurate in traffic flow prediction. Hence, the research content provides a reference for the investment planning of intelligent transportation system infrastructure.},

  abstract={In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.},

  pages={2359-2367},
  abstract={The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.},

  abstract={While Digital Twins (DTs) bring convenience to city managers, they also generate new challenges to city network security. Currently, cyberspace security becomes increasingly complicated. Intrusion detection and Deep Learning (DL) are combined with shunning security threats in service computing systems and improving network defense capabilities. DTs can be applied to network security. People's understanding of cyberspace security can be improved using DTs to digitally define, model, and display the network environment and security status. The intrusion detection data are optimized based on DL technology, and a network intrusion detection algorithm integrated with Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed. In the cloud service system, a trust model based on Keyed-Hashing-based Self-Synchronization (KHSS) is introduced. This model predicts the security state and detects attacks according to existing malicious attacks, ensuring the network security defense system's regular operation. Finally, simulation experiments verify the Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model's feasibility and the cloud trust model. The DBN algorithm proposed improves the correct detection rate of unknown samples by 4.05% compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. From the 20,100 pieces of data in the test dataset, the number of correct attacks detected by the DBN algorithm exceeds those by the SVM algorithm by 818. DBN algorithm requires a short detection time while ensuring optimal detection accuracy. The KHSS+DBN model predicts cloud security states, and the results are the same as the actual states, with an error of only 1%∼2%.},

  abstract={Digitalization slowly but steadily transforms the modern production cells by adding an IT layer to their structure, which, subsequently, leads to the use of cyber-physical systems (CPS) as production cell components. Digital representation of those components through the definition of the corresponding description models starts in the early design phase of the engineering process. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach promotes increased reusability of component models and allows an automatic generation of the system of interest model and its validation through simulation, which results in a shorter design phase. However, existing solutions for CPS description models contain mainly skills and functionalities of the component from a task-oriented perspective to achieve platform-independent code generation for the components control. Semantic information in the skills description usually is completely absent or present only to the extent, which is not enough to match the corresponding components to the product requirements and necessary production processes. Instead, production cell components are manually assigned to the manufacturing processes, which are required for the product. This manual step hinders the automatic production cell model generation based on the product requirements. To allow automatic matching from product descriptions to specific CPSs, a new approach to CPS description is necessary. This description should allow the entirely automatic generation of production cell models through the matching of CPS skills and product requirements. In this paper, a semantic metamodel for CPS is presented. This metamodel enriches CPS models with high-granularity graph-based skill descriptions, which, in combination with the appropriate manufacturing process descriptions, allow automatic matching for production planning and further simulation and ontimization.},

  abstract={SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSThe evolution from "document-centric" to "data-centric" and "model-centric" information leveraging structured data and model-based approaches is at the heart of digital engineering transformational efforts underway across industry and government. It is these approaches that pave the way for data lakes, Authoritative Sources of Truth (ASOTs), and systems-of-systems interoperability and the corresponding transformational benefits thereof. Such benefits include increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability, real-time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly) acceleration of the time-to-value and time-to-insights associated with engineering products and analyses. The longer-term benefits of reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS) activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle. The SMA community often operate in parallel with engineering activities, for which information exchange with relevant context is paramount. Far too often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and reporting.This paper provides an overview of how NASA’s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance, and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the benefits emerging in this new digital era. A roadmap for achieving this digital future is presented along with key building blocks involving use and implementation of concepts such as: Objectives-Hierarchies, Objective-Driven Requirements, Accepted Standards, Safety and Assurance Cases, data digitization (i.e., ontologies, structured data, and model-centric data), FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, & Reusable) and/or FAIRUST (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, Understandable, Secure, and Trusted) principles [1]. This paper also describes how OSMA, leveraging the Agency’s overall commitment to Digital Transformation (DT), is using the power of Policy, "Digital" Domain representation, Product Evolution, and Community Outreach and Engagement as part of a strategic vision and roadmap to evolve and transform its SMA organizations to become better able to serve its stakeholders and customers. Future publications will elaborate on these building blocks and deeper concepts.},

  abstract={As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.},

  abstract={As the field of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) continues to advance in the aerospace industry and far beyond, company executives in all aspects of the program lifecycle now have the opportunity to investigate and begin implementing meaningful applications of the digital thread to ideally realize time and cost savings for both current and future company efforts. One such portion of the product lifecycle often overlooked when allocating resources for digital thread implementation is the logistics and sustainment phase, which in many cases can account for the majority of the total program cost over the lifespan of the product. This paper in particular examines, as a case study, an opportunity for program sustainment to benefit directly from the digital thread by focusing on modeling subsystem block diagrams in SysML, and using those models to assess, verify, and ultimately generate deliverables assessing the Built-In-Test (BIT) capability of a given system. This information in the form of system models or paper deliverables can greatly expedite routine maintenance procedures for example by allowing technicians to quickly locate faulty cable harnesses in the field, or by enabling reliability engineers to verifiably and instantly ensure that BIT faults have complete coverage over all possible failures, including new ones resulting from costly lessons learned in operational usage. The goal of this effort is to outline a specific concept under which BIT behaviors may be modeled in SysML and how they relate to already established subsystem models, but the broader idea of the paper is to present an argument for the very tangible benefits of investing in and establishing a digital thread not just in the design phase of a program, but also across typical company silos and into the product support and sustainment organizations as well.},

  abstract={A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

  abstract={Predictive maintenance is a well studied collection of techniques that aims to prolong the life of a mechanical system by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict the optimal time to perform maintenance. The methods allow maintainers of systems and hardware to reduce financial and time costs of upkeep. As these methods are adopted for more serious and potentially life-threatening applications, the human operators need trust the predictive system. This attracts the field of Explainable AI (XAI) to introduce explainability and interpretability into the predictive system. XAI brings methods to the field of predictive maintenance that can amplify trust in the users while maintaining well-performing systems. This survey on explainable predictive maintenance (XPM) discusses and presents the current methods of XAI as applied to predictive maintenance while following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. We categorize the different XPM methods into groups that follow the XAI literature. Additionally, we include current challenges and a discussion on future research directions in XPM.},

  abstract={Robotics engineering is gradually becoming an essential part of our daily life. However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used platforms to carry data capturing sensors for various applications. The reason for this success can be found in many aspects: the high maneuverability of the UAVs, the capability of performing autonomous data acquisition, flying at different heights, and the possibility to reach almost any vantage point. The selection of appropriate viewpoints and planning the optimum trajectories of UAVs is an emerging topic that aims at increasing the automation, efficiency, and reliability of the data capturing process to achieve a dataset with desired quality. On the other hand, 3-D reconstruction using the data captured by UAVs is also attracting attention in research and industry. This article investigates a wide range of model-free and model-based algorithms for viewpoints and path planning for 3-D reconstruction of large-scale objects. It presents a bibliography of more than 200 references to cover different aspects of the topic. The analyzed approaches are limited to those that employ a single-UAV as a data capturing platform for outdoor 3-D reconstruction purposes. In addition to discussing the evaluation strategies, this article also highlights the innovations and limitations of the investigated approaches. It concludes with a critical analysis of the existing challenges and future research perspectives.},

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.},

  abstract={Predictive maintenance for power electronic converters has emerged as a critical area of research and development. With the rapid advancements in deep-learning techniques, new possibilities have emerged for enhancing the performance and reliability of power converters. However, addressing challenges related to data resources, physical consistency, and generalizability has become crucial in achieving optimal strategies. This comprehensive review article presents an insightful overview of the recent advancements in the field of predictive maintenance for power converters. It explores three paradigms: model-based approaches, data-driven techniques, and the emerging concept of physics-informed machine learning (PIML). By leveraging the integration of physical knowledge into machine-learning architectures, PIML holds great promise for overcoming the aforementioned concerns. Drawing upon the current state-of-art, this review identifies common trends, practical challenges, and significant research opportunities in the domain of predictive maintenance for power converters. The analysis covers a broad spectrum of approaches used for parameter identification, feature engineering, fault detection, and remaining useful life estimation.

  year={2024},
  volume={9},
  number={1},
  pages={2409-2418},
  abstract={With the gradual perfection of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs), it is obligatory to assess their safety performance in simulation that mirrors the real-world driving environment. However, the minimal likelihood of exposure to risky events can result in an extremely time-consuming testing process. To address this issue, we applied a surrogate-based method to expedite scenario-based simulated safety testing for HAVs. Model-based surrogates can quickly approximate the results of untested scenarios, thereby facilitating the search for risky scenarios. Car-following and Cut-in scenarios were chosen as two representative Operational Design Domains (ODDs) with different dimensions for case study. Thus, the capabilities of various Surrogate Models (SMs) can be examined in depth. Utilizing the HighD data, two testing ODDs were constructed to be consistent with naturalistic distribution. We demonstrated that the performances of six mainstream SMs differ significantly as the frequency of risky scenarios decreases. Additionally, we conducted multiple rounds of tests to compare the stability of SMs. We also presented a proposal on SMs selection according to the complexity of ODDs and the rarity of risky scenarios. Compared with random testing, the surrogate-based method can search for 4 times as many high-risk Car-following scenarios with only 4% of the test resources, showing great potential in accelerating the testing process. Notably, when the targeted scenarios are not rare in high-dimensional ODD, the calculation simplicity of SMs is the most important factor. Even random testing can be a viable option in such circumstances.},

  abstract={This paper proposes the use of translation invariant dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DT DWT) noise model to the problem of multipath signals detection in underwater sound. The design procedures for an adaptive model of the background noise, using recursive density estimation of the joint distribution of the multivariate vectors of its shift-invariant DT DWT, which allows the transform to provide shift invariance are described. When the input signal is shifted as in a multipath environment, this shift-invariant DT DWT can generate multiresolution subspaces, that keep more of their coefficient energy in each of these subspaces than in DWTs. For this improvement, the performance of this method can be increased by reducing the false alarm probability of detecting a multipath signal in a range of different signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract={The teaching of medicine has always been based on very detailed knowledge of anatomical structures of human body. In order to improve the education of human anatomy, the history has brought different teaching methods and approaches using the best available techniques and technologies at a given time. Some of these approaches were considered to be the crucial ones and remain almost unchanged for hundreds of years, while others were designed as valuable complementary resources to face-to-face lectures and lessons allowing learners to study and to understand details of particular anatomical structures and systems through various more or less illustrative ways. Despite the fact that the anatomy has been taught for centuries, there is still no clear consensus of what is the best teaching method to deliver anatomical knowledge and the discussions among professionals continue also in today's modern information technology based era all around the world. Our experienced anatomists suggest the cadaver-based instructions are invaluable part in medical education and should be used in combination with traditional lectures and model based practical lessons for deep understanding of anatomy that is necessary for subsequent safe medical practice. To reach this goal, we developed our own repository of video records with cadaveric dissections and used it in teaching of human anatomy in general and dental medicine students. Comparing the study results the learners obtained, it was observed this approach had a significantly positive effect on their study results. On the other hand, we conducted a survey among learners to verify how this approach affected the process of learning and their in-depth understanding of particular anatomical structures.},

  title={Optimizing transformer parasitics in an inductor-less resonant converter},

  abstract={In this paper, the optimization of a 10 kW serial MPPT DC/DC converter designed to inject solar power into a low-voltage DC-microgrid is presented. The prototype was designed as two cascaded stages; an interleaved multi-branch boost topology followed by an inductor-less resonant topology. Traditionally, resonant converters use an external inductor, separating the resonant tank from the transformer. This has practical reasons but also has the drawback of an additional component and added weight. For this reason, the design exploits the leakage inductance of the transformer. However, the first prototype was overheating even in no-load conditions.This paper presents the optimization study conducted to eliminate this overheating. The analysis and simulations performed allowed to identify and pinpoint the source of the issue, namely highlighting the role of the parasitic capacitances in the high di/dt current step in the transformer. Simulations where first done to rough out the problem and get a better understanding of the different interactions between various parasitic elements. A literature review was conducted, and a theoretical analysis method was then applied. This allowed to estimate the order of magnitude of the transformer’s parasitic capacitances and helped fine tune the simulation model. Based on the performed analysis, recommendations and specifications were prepared for a new transformer. An new optimized transformer was then built and tested. The results were better than expected. The parasitics were reduced by 90%, showing that the issue had correctly been identified and addressed.},

  abstract={This paper presents a profile-based approach utilizing supervised learning methods to identify the lyricist of Bangla songs written by two legendary poets & novelist Kazi Nazrul Islam and Rabindranath Tagore. The problem statement for this paper could be considered as authorship attribution using stylometric features on Bangla lyrics. We have utilized the BanglaMusicStylo dataset, which consists of 856 and 620 songs of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, respectively. The traditional authorship attribution works found in the literature are based on the novels written by the authors, not Bangla song lyrics. Using the Bangla song lyrics made it a challenging task, as the word choices made by the authors in songs depends on the rhythms, completeness, situation and many more. In this paper, we have tried to fusion different types of stylometric features, such as lexical, structural, stylistic etc. For experimentation, we have designed the prediction model based on supervised learning exploiting Naïve Bayes (NB), Simple Logistic Regression (SLR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The experimental model consists of several steps including data pre-processing, feature extraction, data processing, and classification model. After performance evaluation, we have got approximately 86.29% accuracy from SLR, which is quite satisfactory.},
