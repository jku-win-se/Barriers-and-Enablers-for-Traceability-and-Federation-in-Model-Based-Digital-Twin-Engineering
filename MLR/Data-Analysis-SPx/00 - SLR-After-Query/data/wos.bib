Title = {Designing solutions with the product-service systems digital twin: What
   is now and what is next?},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) are of particular interest in the domain of
   Product-Service Systems (PSS), to predict hardware availability, to
   inform about the needed features of new solutions, and to forecast the
   expected performances of new configurations in operation. The aim of
   this paper is to shed light on the extent to which `twins' are applied
   today across the PSS life cycle, and to spotlight the ability of
   DT-related case studies to capture a full value perspective vs. simply
   attempting to represent hardware and services in the digital realm. By
   means of a systematic literature review combined with a mapping study,
   the paper reveals how only a minimal part of the existing literature is
   able to demonstrate how real-time physical-to-virtual and
   virtual-to-physical connections can be used to improve the design of
   servitized solutions. The analysis shows how contributions in the topic
   are mostly proposing frameworks and methods, as opposed to models and
   tools, as well as how `evaluation', `validation' tasks are largely
   neglected. As a result, the paper proposes a specialized definition of
   the PSS DT, together with a set of research questions that need to be
   answered to empower the engineering teams with relevant DT for PSS
   design. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. CC\_BY\_4.0},

Title = {Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {269},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other
   industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such
   interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers
   and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term
   Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times
   erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as
   a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the
   physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital
   Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated
   living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature
   for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the
   identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital
   Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields.
   Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future
   studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research
   advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely
   addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that
   research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design
   of future ships.},

Title = {Architecting Digital Twins},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {50335-50350},
Abstract = {In 2002, Grieves defined the concept of the digital twin as a virtual
   instance of physical assets capable of continuously mirroring them. Ever
   since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins
   flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial
   adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software
   engineering community in general and the software architecture community
   in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published
   peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions
   for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution,
   and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins.
   The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital
   twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and
   architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital
   twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying
   trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially
   relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary
   studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data
   extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single
   method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity,
   we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software
   architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software
   architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of
   architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of
   widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins,
   most of them are built using a combination of the layered and
   service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance
   efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.},

Title = {Developing an integrative framework for digital twin applications in the
   building construction industry: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In response to the global advocacy for digitalization, numerous
   industrial sectors are actively advancing the implementation of digital
   twins (DTs). However, the construction industry has been slow to adopt
   DT, lagging behind sectors such as manufacturing and medicine, where
   digitalization has made significant strides. Given the demonstrated
   benefits and potential of DT, it is crucial to increase research efforts
   for enhancing its application in the construction industry. To
   accurately identify prospective areas for future research, a
   comprehensive review and analysis of the status quo of relevant research
   is urgently needed. This study undertook a systematic literature review
   to understand how DT can enhance operational intelligence in the
   building construction industry. The findings, based on a review of
   pertinent literature, revealed that existing studies predominantly
   focused on the application of DT during the construction phase and the
   operation and maintenance phase. However, its potential use during the
   planning and design phase and the demolition and recovery phase was
   largely overlooked. Three main categories of key digital facilitating
   technologies for DT in the building construction industry have been
   identified: (1) data -related technologies; (2) high-fidelity modeling
   technologies; and (3) model -based simulation technologies. These
   technologies have finally culminated into an integrative framework.
   Furthermore, three significant research gaps in the application of DT in
   the building construction industry have been identified, suggesting
   future studies explore how to (1) centralize diverse stakeholders from a
   lifecycle perspective; (2) address various existing technological
   defects; and (3) establish a universal industry standard. This paper
   provides a valuable roadmap for relevant stakeholders to understand the
   status quo of DT application and the existing deficiencies in its full
   implementation, which should facilitate the efficient digitalization of
   the construction industry.},

Abstract = {Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formal in-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
   has been proposed as a potential tool in the diagnosis of autoimmune
   billions diseases (AIBDs) in lieu of standard direct immunofluorescence
   (DIF) microscopy. To comprehensively determine the diagnostic accuracy
   of immunoglobulin and complement IIIC for diagnosis of AIBDs, we
   conducted a systematic review and multivariate Bayesian model-based
   meta-analysis of the literature. Quality and heterogeneity assessment of
   studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
   Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist and the 1 2 index, respectively.
   Electronic searches using PubMed from April 1964 to July 2020 identified
   14 articles meeting predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Median sensitivities with 95\% credible intervals in pemphigus and
   pemphigoid were 0.24 (0.01-0.89) and 0.22 (0.02-0.77) with
   immunoglobulin G (IgG), 0.77 (0.39-0.95) and 0.25 (0.02-0.85) with IgG4.
   0.11 (0.02-0.32) and 0.86 (0.56-0.98) with C3d, and 0.84 (0.56-0.97) and
   0.75 (0.37-0.94) with C4d, respectively. Specificities were 1.00
   (0.00-1.00) with IgG, 0.98 (0.89-1.00) with IgG4, 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with
   C3d, and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with C4d. The risk of bias and heterogeneity
   among studies was a serious problem, decreasing the level of evidence.
   Our work suggests that, in selected cases, paraffin-based IHC may be a
   helpful procedure to screen for AIBDs, especially when specialized
   laboratories and/or biopsy specimens for DIF do not exist. Nevertheless,
   more studies with a refined quality design are needed to explore the
   true usefulness of this diagnostic method in AIBDs.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to describe theoretical and current
   thought leadership on managing system complexity to engage improvement

   current trends in systems management as a means for continuous

   through reductionist strategies. This conceptualisation of holistic
   management of organisations is opening up pathways for best practice and
   emerging trends, such as through methods focused on the explicit, such
   as for reducing risk and increasing efficiency via model-based or
   simulation-based engineering, and the Digital Twin. But also through
   methods focused on the tacit, such as through shedding of paradigms that
   serve as barriers to systems management through adaptive management,
   standardisation of outcomes, integration structures and integrated
   ideation of system congruence are being used for improving results. A
   literature review and presentation of four case studies are provided
   make the case for the need and effect of managing system complexity for
   better results. These trends in systems thought leadership and practices
   in systemology open up organisational capacity to engage in enriched

Abstract = {The creation of a digital twin of rail infrastructure assets places
   greater emphasis on requirements engineering, model-based delivery
   methods, and digital information management to support the creation of
   both physical and virtual deliverables. However, requirements
   engineering capabilities are latent in comparison to complex discrete
   manufacturing. In this paper, we explore requirements engineering
   practices in Australian rail infrastructure projects creating digital
   twins for asset management and operations. An investigation of the
   challenges encountered by project teams during the development of asset
   information requirements for physical and digital deliverables was
   conducted using an in-depth literature review together with
   semi-structured interviews with rail project delivery teams. Challenges
   to the maturity of requirements engineering were categorised according
   to their main characteristics. The process, technology and supply chain
   issues identified provide empirical evidence of the pain points faced by
   delivery teams in developing asset information requirements in support
   of the creation of a digital twin. Findings serve as a starting point
   for further research into the development of requirements engineering
   methods distinguished by systems-based approaches.},

Title = {Digital Twins for cities: Analyzing the gap between concepts and current
   implementations with a specific focus on data integration},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Digital Twins for cities represent a new trend for urban and geospatial
   fields. Currently, some DTs implementations are taking place.
   Nevertheless, the whole concept remains ambiguous and presents some
   differences that need to be addressed. The aim of this article is to
   bridge the gap between DTs definitions and current implementations. This
   review was conducted through a scientific literature review and an
   online survey. The study collects Digital Twins for cities definitions
   and compares them with related concepts used jointly in the literature.
   It puts them together through an in-depth analysis since they express
   similarities and various discrepancies. As our study highlights the most
   documented DTs initiatives for cities according to 9 comprehensive
   categories, a new approach assessing the initiatives is proposed to
   evaluate the data integration methods used in the current realizations.
   Three levels are suggested: a conceptual schema model-based level (the
   data are integrated into the top level of the DT, i.e., extending the
   schema model to cover new features or themes); a databasebased level
   (data are integrated in order to feed or update specific attributes or
   classes); and an application-based level (the data are integrated into
   the application generally at the viewer level).},

Title = {Toward Data-Driven Optimal Control: A Systematic Review of the Landscape},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {32190-32212},
Abstract = {This literature review extends and contributes to research on the
   development of data-driven optimal control. Previous reviews have
   documented the development of model-based and data-driven control in
   isolation and have not critically reviewed reinforcement learning
   approaches for adaptive data-driven optimal control frameworks. The
   presented review discusses the development of model-based to model-free
   adaptive controllers, highlighting the use of data in control
   frameworks. In data-driven control frameworks, reinforcement learning
   methods may be used to derive the optimal policy for dynamical systems.
   Attractive characteristics of these methods include not requiring a
   mathematical model of complex systems, their inherent adaptive control
   capabilities, being an unsupervised learning technique and their
   decision-making abilities, which are both an advantage and motivation
   behind this approach. This review considers previous reviews on these
   topics, including recent work on data-driven control methods. In
   addition, this review shows the use of data to derive system dynamics,
   determine the control policy using feedback information, and tune fixed
   controllers. Furthermore, the review summarises various data-driven
   methods and their corresponding characteristics. Finally, the review
   provides a taxonomy, a timeline and a concise narrative of the
   development of model-based to model-free data-driven adaptive control
   and underlines the limitations of these techniques due to the lack of
   theoretical analysis. Areas of further work include theoretical analysis
   on stability and robustness for data-driven control systems,
   explainability of black-box policy learning techniques and an evaluation
   of the impact of the extension of system simulators to include digital
   twins.},

Title = {Sustainable Business Model Based on Digital Twin Platform Network: The
   Inspiration from Haier's Case Study in China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sustainability and digitalization have become the main direction of
   transformation of enterprises. Building a digital twin platform network
   can provide enterprises with a comprehensive view of products,
   manufacture, supply chain, customer experience, and profitability, which
   is conducive to the construction of a sustainable business model. The
   purpose of this paper is to study how enterprises use digital twin
   platform networks to generate economic, social and environmental
   benefits in various dimensions and their coupling relationships. Based
   on the literature review, this paper constructs a five-dimensional
   framework of a sustainable business model, and analyses the coupling
   relationship between dimensions. Using Haier as a way to verify the
   five-dimensional framework, it explores the dynamic mechanism of the
   Haier digital twin platform network, constructs an integrated framework
   based on coupling perspective and compares it with other two home
   appliance enterprises. The study shows that, through the digital twin
   platform network, enterprises can remove the disadvantage of focusing on
   a single product life cycle, and form a comprehensive network, so as to
   promote overall sustainable upgrades. This paper draws generic
   strategies and digital transformation suggestions for enterprises to
   innovate the sustainable business model. The conclusion enriches the
   research on sustainable business models both theoretically and
   practically and provides a feasible reference for the transformation of
   enterprises in digital economy environment.},

Abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual representation of a system containing all
   information available on site. This paper presents condition monitoring
   of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin
   approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning
   maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art
   fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition
   monitoring, data-based schemes and model -based approaches, and the
   digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model -based
   approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault
   detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection
   would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive
   maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be
   reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and
   methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical -based
   model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no
   clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly
   answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces
   several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages,
   disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a
   drivetrain it is found that multi -body simulation is advised for the
   creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain
   test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to
   investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived
   empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in
   the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy,
   however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a
   digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the
   stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness
   sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries
   that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are
   discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable
   assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime
   and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case
   study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro- Ro (roll on roll
   off) vessels. The vessels in the case study are managed by Wilhelmsen
   Ship Management and a discussion of the implementation of digital twins
   in this sector is comprised in this article.},

Abstract = {In recent years, future manufacturing systems following a vision of
   Industry 4.0 has been accelerated in order to enable more personalized,
   smart, and sustainable production. However, unsolved security challenges
   from their enlarged accessibility and connectivity have delayed
   realizing such systems. To address the emerging issues, the blockchain
   technology can be adopted to utilize its inherent generic security
   capabilities. However, research regarding the use of blockchain in
   manufacturing systems has only begun in the past few years while their
   research findings have been disseminated through a wide range of
   different outlets. This paper presents a literature review covering how
   manufacturing systems can adopt the blockchain technology while
   maintaining their production capacity, flexibility, and costefficiency.
   In addition to the survey, five categories of manufacturing systems
   striving to achieve the goal of Industry 4.0 are defined to provide a
   system model-based analysis. Also, a technology roadmap-that visualizes
   the chronological history of the technology-has been adopted to present
   the research trend and identify opportunities for future studies.},

Title = {Conceptual Framework of Information Flow Synchronization Throughout the
   Building Lifecycle},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction industry's reliance on traditional methods and
   fragmented workflows results in significant information loss,
   inefficiencies, increased costs, and errors. This study addresses these
   issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building
   information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow
   throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that
   synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national
   and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and
   analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a
   conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and
   interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting
   open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for
   effective information exchange. By implementing an information model
   (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit
   processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory
   compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated
   information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction
   practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research
   illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize
   the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and
   fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust
   framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency
   and accuracy of construction processes.},

Title = {Uncertainty analysis on support vector machine for measuring
   organizational factors in probabilistic risk assessment of nuclear power
   plants},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {153},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper is a product of a line of research by the authors to
   explicitly incorporate organizational factors into the probabilistic
   risk assessment (PRA) of complex socio-technical systems. This explicit
   incorporation helps (i) assess the system risk due to organizational and
   managerial weaknesses, (ii) identify the critical organizational root
   causes of failure scenarios, aiding in effective corrective action, and
   (iii) avoid the potential of under-estimating the system risk involving
   human error and organizational factors. To facilitate the measurement of
   organizational factors contributing to the PRA scenarios, the previous
   studies by the authors developed the Data -Theoretic methodology, where
   ``data analytics{''} are guided by a ``theory{''} of underlying
   causation to prevent misleading results from solely data-oriented
   approaches. The Data-Theoretic methodology consists of two sub -modules:
   (a) DT-BASE that develops a detailed causal model based on a
   theory-building process and is equipped with a baseline quantification
   utilizing analyst interpretation of information extracted from relevant
   references; and (b) DT-SITE that conducts data analytics (text mining
   using machine learning) to quantify the organizational causal elements
   based on industry event databases. This article investigates uncertainty
   analysis for the un-certainties associated with machine learning-based
   data mining in DT-SITE using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
   for industry event databases. This article conducts a literature review
   and proposes a catego-rization scheme of the SVM uncertainties to
   establish a theoretical foundation for identifying uncertainty sources
   associated with the SVM classifier. The implementation of uncertainty
   analysis for DT-SITE is then illustrated using a nuclear power plant
   case study. The potential uncertainty sources related to the SVM
   classifier used in DT-SITE are identified using the categorization
   scheme developed based on the literature review. The uncertainty
   analysis procedure for the SVM classifier in DT-SITE is proposed, and

Abstract = {The concept of object-to-object similarity plays a crucial role in
   interactive content-based video retrieval tools. Similarity (or
   distance) models are core components of several retrieval concepts, e.g.
   Query by Example or relevance feedback. In these scenarios, the common
   approach is to apply some feature extractor that transforms the object
   to a vector of features, i.e., positions it into an induced latent
   space. The similarity is then based on some distance metric in this
   space.
   Historically, feature extractors were mostly based on some color
   histograms or hand-crafted descriptors such as SIFT, but nowadays
   state-of-the-art tools mostly rely on some deep learning (DL)
   approaches. However, so far there were no systematic study of how
   suitable are individual feature extractors in the video retrieval
   domain. Or, in other words, to what extent are human-perceived and
   model-based similarities concordant. To fill this gap, we conducted a
   user study with over 4000 similarity judgements comparing over 20
   variants of feature extractors. Results corroborate the dominance of
   deep learning approaches, but surprisingly favor smaller and simpler DL
   models instead of larger ones.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the optimization of a 10 kW serial MPPT DC/DC converter
   designed to inject solar power into a low-voltage DC-microgrid is
   presented. The prototype was designed as two cascaded stages; an
   interleaved multi-branch boost topology followed by an inductor-less
   resonant topology. Traditionally, resonant converters use an external
   inductor, separating the resonant tank from the transformer. This has
   practical reasons but also has the drawback of an additional component
   and added weight. For this reason, the design exploits the leakage
   inductance of the transformer. However, the first prototype was
   overheating even in no-load conditions.
   This paper presents the optimization study conducted to eliminate this
   overheating. The analysis and simulations performed allowed to identify
   and pinpoint the source of the issue, namely highlighting the role of
   the parasitic capacitances in the high di/dt current step in the
   transformer. Simulations where first done to rough out the problem and
   get a better understanding of the different interactions between various
   parasitic elements. A literature review was conducted, and a theoretical
   analysis method was then applied. This allowed to estimate the order of
   magnitude of the transformer's parasitic capacitances and helped fine
   tune the simulation model. Based on the performed analysis,
   recommendations and specifications were prepared for a new transformer.
   An new optimized transformer was then built and tested. The results were
   better than expected. The parasitics were reduced by 90\%, showing that
   the issue had correctly been identified and addressed.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {MMC is a promising technology for MTDC systems and would transform into
   the concept of Supergrids in the near future. The salient features of
   MMC are modularity, reduced dv/dt and di/dt stress on switches, voltage
   and power scalability, inherent fault blocking capacity, transformerless
   operation, and improved power quality. However, there are some technical
   issues and challenges to be critically analysed and addressed. There is
   room for development of novel and enhanced MMC based on SM
   configurations to enable higher efficiency, improved power quality,
   compactness, and DC fault blocking capacity. Moreover, development of
   efficient and accurate models is required for the studies of MTDC grids
   during steady-state and transient conditions. Literature review suggests
   a need for studying and comparing different MMC modelling approaches
   because no modelling technique can be best suited for all applications.
   The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review
   of recent developments in MMC in terms of SM configurations. This paper
   also presents an in-depth review of systematic comparison of different
   models of MMC, which can enable appropriate selection of model based on
   target studies and desired accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the
   associated research challenges and future trends are presented.},

Abstract = {Since its first introduction in 2002, the interest in the concept of
   ``Digital Twins{''} has grown exponentially among researchers and
   industry practitioners. An increasing number of Digital Twin
   implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the
   concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges
   when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has
   been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the
   high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the
   production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling
   this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that
   process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets,
   as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be
   leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the
   findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a
   dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key
   learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for
   further research are proposed.},

Abstract = {Network traffic prediction (NTP) can predict future traffic leveraging
   historical data, which serves as proactive methods for network resource
   planning, allocation, and management. Besides, NTP can also be applied
   for load generation in simulated and emulated as well as digital twin
   networks (DTNs). This paper focuses on accurately predicting background
   traffic matrix (TM) of typical local area network (LAN) for traffic
   synchronization in DTN. A survey is firstly conducted on DTN,
   conventional model, and deep learning based NTP methods. Then, as the
   major contribution, a linear feature enhanced convolutional long
   short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model based NTP method is proposed for LAN.
   An autoregressive unit is integrated into the ConvLSTM model to improve
   its linear prediction ability. In addition, this paper further optimizes
   the proposed model from both spatial and channel-wise dimensions.
   Particularly, a traffic pattern attention (TPA) block and a squeeze \&
   excitation (SE) block are derived and added to the enhanced ConvLSTM
   (eConvLSTM) model. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the
   eConvLSTM model outperforms all the baselines. It can improve the
   prediction accuracy by reducing the mean square error (MSE) up to 10.6\%
   for one-hop prediction and 16.8\% for multi-hops prediction, compared to
   the legacy CovnLSTM model, with still satisfying the efficiency
   requirements. The further enhancement of the eConvLSTM model can
   additionally reduce the MSE about 2.1\% for one-hop prediction and 4.2\%
   for multi-hops prediction, with slightly degrading efficiency. The
   proposed eConvLSTM model based NTP method can play a vital role on DTN
   traffic synchronization.},

Title = {Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building
   construction processes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Intelligent construction is a necessary way to improve the traditional
   construction method, and digital twin can be a crucial technology to
   promote intelligent construction. However, the construction field
   currently needs a unified method to build a standardized and universally
   applicable digital twin model, which is incredibly challenging in
   construction. Therefore, this paper proposes a general method to
   construct a digital twin construction process model based on the
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, aiming to realize real-time
   monitoring, control, and visualization management of the construction
   site. The method constructs a digital twin fusion model from three
   levels: geometric model, resource model, and behavioral model by
   establishing an IFC semantic model of the construction process, storing
   the fusion model data and the construction site data into a database,
   and completing the dynamic interaction of the twin data in the database.
   At the same time, the digital twin platform is developed to realize the
   visualization and control of the construction site. Combined with
   practical cases and analysis, the implementation effect of the method is
   shown and verified. The results show that the method can adapt itself to
   different scenarios on the construction site, which is conducive to
   promoting application of the digital twin in the field of construction
   and provides a reference to the research of practicing digital twin
   theory and practice.},

Abstract = {To realize the great potential of the intelligent transportation
   infrastructure, the investment in the transportation infrastructure in
   the intelligent transportation system should be rationally planned.
   Firstly, the application status of cutting-edge Data Envelopment
   Analysis (DEA) model in transportation infrastructure efficiency
   evaluation is analyzed, and based on this, a DEA model of transportation
   infrastructure efficiency evaluation under Digital Twins technology is
   established. Secondly, with the transportation infrastructure of 12
   prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province from 2005 to 2020 as the
   research object, the Digital Twins DEA model and the traditional
   Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) model are used to estimate the
   efficiency of transportation infrastructure in 12 cities. Finally, the
   traffic flow data of a certain road section in Zhenjiang City (J11 City)
   is simulated and predicted by using the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)
   traffic flow prediction model. The results show that the average
   efficiency of the 12 cities estimated by the DEA model based on the
   Digital Twins is 0.7083, the average efficiency of the 12 cities
   estimated by the SFA model is 0.6445, and there are significant
   differences in the efficiency rankings of the cities. Compared with the
   actual efficiency, the established Digital Twins DEA model is more
   reasonable for the calculation of transportation infrastructure
   efficiency. The results of the LSTM traffic flow prediction model show
   that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the LSTM model is 24.29, the Root
   Mean Square Error (RSME) is 0.1186, and the Mean Absolute Perce (MAPE)
   is 17.78, which are all lower than other models. Compared with other
   models, the proposed LSTM-based traffic flow prediction model is more
   accurate in traffic flow prediction. Hence, the research content
   provides a reference for the investment planning of intelligent
   transportation system infrastructure.},

Title = {Comprehensive Review of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Digital

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive survey of machine learning, deep
   learning, and digital twin technology methods for predicting and
   managing the battery state of health in electric vehicles. Battery state
   of health estimation is essential for optimizing the battery usage,
   performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles.
   Estimating the state of health of a battery is a complex undertaking due
   to its dependency on multiple factors. These factors include battery
   characteristics such as type, chemistry, size, temperature, current,
   voltage, impedance, cycle number, and driving pattern. There are
   drawbacks to traditional methods, such as experimental and model-based
   approaches, in terms of accuracy, complexity, expense, and viability for
   real-time applications. By employing a variety of algorithms to discover
   the nonlinear and dynamic link between the battery parameters and the
   state of health, data-driven techniques like machine learning, deep
   learning, and data-driven digital twin technologies can get beyond these
   restrictions. Data-driven methods can also incorporate physics and
   domain knowledge to improve the explainability and interpretability of
   the results. This paper reviews the latest advancements and challenges
   of using data-driven techniques for battery state of health estimation
   and management in electric vehicles. The paper also discusses the future
   directions and opportunities for further research and development in
   this field. The survey scope spans publications from the year 2021 to
   2023.},

Abstract = {Airports play an essential role within the transportation and
   infrastructure sectors. As modernizing and expanding airport
   infrastructures receive a higher priority, addressing inefficiencies in
   capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) through
   transformative digital ecosystems is gaining an increasing level of
   interest. Building information modeling (BIM) can form a basis to enable
   an end-to-end digital delivery platform, where airport life cycle data
   can be utilized for actionable insights. This study proposes a scalable,
   novel BIM-based modularized platform architecture based on model-based
   system engineering (MBSE) principles with systems modeling language
   (SysML) for optimal collection, integration, management, and utilization
   of airport critical asset data. This platform architecture aims at
   acting as a metaframework that enables an airport digital twin through
   cohesive and structured view of asset life cycle information for
   insightful actions by major airport stakeholders. Research methodology
   features an online survey and focus group discussions for data
   collection; mixed method analysis for data analysis; MBSE with SysML for
   data mapping; and prototype demonstration and an expert opinion survey
   for validation. Adopting a scalable BIM-based digital platform is
   anticipated to result in boosts in business value of airport
   infrastructures by sustaining value generation in operations and
   decreasing upfront costs for technology implementation.},

Abstract = {BackgroundDigital twins are computerized patient replicas that allow
   clinical interventions testing in silico to minimize preventable patient
   harm. Our group has developed a novel application software utilizing a
   digital twin patient model based on electronic health record (EHR)
   variables to simulate clinical trajectories during the initial 6 h of
   critical illness. This study aimed to assess the usability, workload,
   and acceptance of the digital twin application as an educational tool in
   critical care.MethodsA mixed methods study was conducted during seven
   user testing sessions of the digital twin application with thirty-five
   first-year internal medicine residents. Qualitative data were collected
   using a think-aloud and semi-structured interview format, while
   quantitative measurements included the System Usability Scale (SUS),
   NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and a short survey.ResultsMedian SUS
   scores and NASA-TLX were 70 (IQR 62.5-82.5) and 29.2 (IQR 22.5-34.2),
   consistent with good software usability and low to moderate workload,
   respectively. Residents expressed interest in using the digital twin
   application for ICU rotations and identified five themes for software
   improvement: clinical fidelity, interface organization, learning
   experience, serious gaming, and implementation strategies.ConclusionA
   digital twin application based on EHR clinical variables showed good
   usability and high acceptance for critical care education.},

Title = {Digital Twin framework for automated fault source detection and
   prediction for comfort performance evaluation of existing
   non-residential Norwegian buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {281},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Numerous buildings fall short of expectations regarding occupant
   satisfaction, sustainability, or energy efficiency. In this paper, the
   performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using
   a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is
   founded on an in-depth anal-ysis of satisfaction survey responses and a
   thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also
   presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify
   data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to
   2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for
   incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor
   data, occupants' feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants' comfort,
   and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants'
   comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well
   as a pre-dictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in
   the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help
   decision-makers improve the occupants' comfort conditions in buildings.
   However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and
   the absence of data integra-tion among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM
   data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology
   graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to
   many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the
   facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that
   influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying
   equipment malfunc-tions, and pointing toward possible solutions.(c) 2022

Abstract = {Comprehensive evaluation of dams in a dynamic and proactive way is
   accepted as an effective strategy to improve dam safety. However, there
   is a lack of efficient and standardised approaches for managing
   monitoring-related information that can help to provide dynamic and
   reliable information for continuous dam evaluation. With the importance
   of digital twins (DTs) being proven in better data integration and
   interoperability, a DT-based approach for comprehensive dam evaluation
   and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation
   classes (IFC) are provided in this study. This paper presents a new data
   structure and corresponding data classification strategy, using which
   information required for continuous evaluation can be effectively
   organised. Considering that existing evaluation methods cannot fully
   characterise uncertainties in the evaluation process, a cloud model
   based comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed. In this approach,
   a multi-rule cloud reasoning model is utilised to evaluate monitoring
   points. Also, a multi-dimensional cloud model and an improved Criteria
   Importance Though Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method are
   leveraged to assess evaluation indices affected by multiple factors.
   Finally, the results of a case study verify that the proposed DT-based
   solution realises a continuous dam safety evaluation, which contributes
   to automated and efficient dam condition monitoring.},

Abstract = {Historically, researchers and practitioners have often failed to
   consider all the areas, factors, and implications of a process within an
   integrated manufacturing model. Thus, the aim of this research was to
   propose a holistic approach to manufacturing processes to assess their
   status and performance. Moreover, using the conceptual model,
   manufacturing systems can be modelled, considering all areas, flows, and
   factors in the respective areas of production, maintenance, and quality.
   As a result, the model serves as the basis for the integral management
   and control of manufacturing systems in digital twin models for the
   regulation of process stability and quality with maintenance strategies.
   Thus, a system dynamics simulation model based on the conceptual model
   is developed for a metallurgical process. The results show how the
   monitoring of all flows together with the optimal strategies in the
   quality and maintenance areas enable companies to increase their
   profitability and customer service level. In conclusion, the conceptual
   approach and the applied simulation case study allow better decision
   making, ensuring continuous optimization along the manufacturing asset
   lifecycle, and providing a unique selling proposition for equipment
   producers and service engineering suppliers as well as industrial
   companies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce applications of Artificial Intelligence
   techniques, such as Decision Trees and Semantic Reasoning, for
   semi-automatic and semantic-model-based decision-making for
   archaeological feature comparisons. This paper uses the example of Roman
   African Red Slip Ware (ARS) and the collection of ARS at the LEIZA
   archaeological research institute. The main challenge is to create a
   Digital Twin of the ARS objects and artefacts using geometric capturing
   and semantic modelling of archaeological information. Moreover, the
   individualisation and comparison of features (appliques), along with
   their visualisation, extraction, and rectification, results in a
   strategy and application for comparison of these features using both
   geometrical and archaeological aspects with a comprehensible rule set.
   This method of a semi-automatic semantic model-based comparison workflow
   for archaeological features on Roman ceramics is showcased, discussed,
   and concluded in three use cases: woman and boy, human-horse hybrid, and
   bears with local twists and shifts.},

Title = {Security in IoT-Enabled Digital Twins of Maritime Transportation Systems},

Abstract = {The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime
   Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of
   Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence
   and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of
   modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the
   Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are
   introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to
   construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation
   IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through
   simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that
   interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information
   non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to
   increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication
   performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that
   the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover,
   given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the
   relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system
   performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations
   reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and
   cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power
   distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in
   different locations, so that system security performance gets improved.
   The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100\%
   successful transmission probability and 0.01 similar to 0.05 lambda
   value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model
   presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing
   an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation
   in the future.},

Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},

Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Managing change in organizations is a laborious task that consumes value
   added time in various segments of the product lifecycle including design
   and development, production, delivery, and product disposition. Product
   lifecycle management plays an important role in minimizing the time
   required for managing engineering changes. This research aims to perform
   an extensive survey of the literature in this area. There is no
   consolidated review available in this area summarizing advances in
   engineering change management vis-a-vis product lifecycle management.
   Thus, the paper gives an overview of product lifecycle management-based
   thinking and change management. This review puts forward the most
   relevant research regarding the practices and frameworks developed for
   managing engineering change in an organization. These include
   model-based definition, digital twin, process-based semantic approach,
   service-oriented architecture, Unified Modeling Language, and unified
   feature modeling. The gaps between the extents of conformance to success
   factors have been identified as extent of integration, standardization,
   versatility of application, support of existing systems, and the extent
   of product lifecycle management support.},

Abstract = {The manufacturing sector is experiencing a technological paradigm shift,
   where new information technology (IT) concepts can help digitize product
   design, production systems, and manufacturing processes. One of such
   concepts is Digital Twin and researchers have made some advancement on
   both its conceptual development and technological implementations.
   However, in practice, there are many different definitions of the
   digital-twin concept. These different definitions have created a lot of
   confusion for practitioners, especially small- and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the adoption and implementation of the
   digital-twin concept in manufacturing have been difficult and slow. In
   this paper, we report our findings from a survey of companies (both
   large and small) regarding their understanding and acceptance of the
   digital-twin concept. Five supply-chain companies from discrete
   manufacturing and one trade organization representing suppliers in the
   automotive business were interviewed. Their operations have been studied
   to understand their current digital maturity levels and articulate their
   needs for digital solutions to stay competitive. This paper presents the
   results of the research including the viewpoints of these companies in
   terms of opportunities and challenges for implementing digital twins.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Modern machines strive to run at limit performance and dependability
   while their operational area and size are getting restricted. To achieve
   those objectives, often swift integration of custom-made subsystems is
   required, either actuators, sensors, electronic, or SW modules. Such a
   diverse suite of elements needs specific approaches and tools for fast
   optimization and adjustment following model-based system engineering
   (MBSE) and digital twinning principles. The large-scale I-MECH project
   was an industry-driven initiative striving to give a scientific response
   to those demands. The intermediate results were summarized in the
   authors' previous work. The purpose of this paper is to report on final
   project results, namely specific performance achievements and figures
   based on measurable KPIs. After a brief description of key technologies,
   special focus is given to industrial printing technology based on a
   generic substrate carrier. However, it is shown that similar and
   consistent methodology can be applicable in many other industrial
   domains, such as semiconductors, healthcare robotics, machining,
   packaging, etc. Thus, the main merit of this survey is a holistic
   approach to motion control design.},

Abstract = {A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system
   interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged.
   Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one
   of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently,
   the training of students and professionals has to address these new
   demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational
   tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that
   implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as
   connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the
   cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity
   measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational
   environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies
   reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes
   cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an
   industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen
   cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to
   transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and
   analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set
   of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been
   proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the
   enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real
   automation. This course has been taught in a master's degree and
   students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey.
   The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the
   students' and faculty's viewpoint.},

Abstract = {While Digital Twins (DTs) bring convenience to city managers, they also
   generate new challenges to city network security. Currently, cyberspace
   security becomes increasingly complicated. Intrusion detection and Deep
   Learning (DL) are combined with shunning security threats in service
   computing systems and improving network defense capabilities. DTs can be
   applied to network security. People's understanding of cyberspace
   security can be improved using DTs to digitally define, model, and
   display the network environment and security status. The intrusion
   detection data are optimized based on DL technology, and a network
   intrusion detection algorithm integrated with Deep Neural Network (DNN)
   model is proposed. In the cloud service system, a trust model based on
   Keyed-Hashing-based Self-Synchronization (KHSS) is introduced. This
   model predicts the security state and detects attacks according to
   existing malicious attacks, ensuring the network security defense
   system's regular operation. Finally, simulation experiments verify the
   Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model's feasibility and the cloud trust
   model. The DBN algorithm proposed improves the correct detection rate of
   unknown samples by 4.05\% compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   algorithm. From the 20,100 pieces of data in the test dataset, the
   number of correct attacks detected by the DBN algorithm exceeds those by
   the SVM algorithm by 818. DBN algorithm requires a short detection time
   while ensuring optimal detection accuracy. The KHSS+DBN model predicts
   cloud security states, and the results are the same as the actual
   states, with an error of only 1\%similar to 2\%.},

Abstract = {Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is considered an important
   approach for understanding multidomain fields and is widely used in
   complex systems such as aerospace. In this article, a detailed survey of
   MBSE literature was conducted from its commencement to the present

   to implement a visual network analysis of MBSE-related manuscripts. The
   results of the bibliometric study revealed the interrelationship and
   distribution of researchers in multidomain fields. The authorized
   sources of MBSE papers were also assorted. The current practices of MBSE
   were analyzed. The future directions for MBSE based on the current
   practices were discussed. We found that MBSE's research has been
   conducted by many research teams with distinctive characteristics, and
   the top publishing sources in this field have emerged. Research on MBSE
   focuses on system engineering, languages, system of systems, and
   digitalization. The development of new technologies such as
   next-generation modeling languages is improving current practical
   problems. The findings of this study may help researchers gain a faster

Title = {BIM and TLS Point Cloud Integration for Information Management of
   Underground Coal Mines: A Case Study in Nui Beo Underground Coal Mining
   in Vietnam},
Journal = {KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 14},
Abstract = {Recently, digital mines (DM) have plays an increasingly important role
   in ensuring the safety, effective management and operation of mining
   activities. One of essential pillars for digital transformation in
   mining is Building Information Model (BIM), which is also one of the
   first steps to implement Digital Twin. Additionally, using BIM
   integrated with Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and adopting digital
   technology can provide powerful assistance in life cycle of mining. In
   this study, integrating BIM and TLS point clouds, which is the basic
   framework of DM, was applied to build 3D mining information model as
   well as assessing safety of Nui Beo underground coal mining in Vietnam.
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard is used to define the mining
   information model based on TLS point clouds providing geometric and
   attributive information of the structures. The 3D model was built for
   important structures of the mine, including the mine shaft, and tunnels
   based on TLS point cloud. Additionally, the safety assessment of rail
   tracks in the mine shaft was performed by comparing the TLS point cloud
   of rail tracks and their as-designed BIM models. The results showed that
   the integration of BIM and TLS is a practical solution for the
   information management and safety assessment of underground coal mines.},

Title = {Prediction of soil organic matter using different soil classification
   hierarchical level stratification strategies and spectral characteristic
   parameters},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {411},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Whether a finer soil classification hierarchical stratification strategy
   and the spectral characteristic parameters (SCPs) that describe the
   shape of the spectral curve can be used to improve the prediction
   accuracy of soil organic matter should be clarified. We measured the
   visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR, 400 - 2500
   nm) spectral reflectance of 322 topsoil samples. The spectral
   reflectance was converted to continuum removal curves, and then, SCPs
   were extracted based on the curves. According to the results of the
   Second National Soil Survey of China, the samples were divided into 4
   great groups or 8 genus, and a variety of stratification strategies were
   constructed based on great group (GR-S), genus (GE-S), spectral
   similarity (SS-S) and decision tree model (DT-S). A local random forest
   model was established to evaluate the performance of different
   stratification strategies and input variables. Our results are described
   as follows: (1) In different stratification strategies, the SOM
   prediction model based on DT-S exhibits the highest accuracy, followed
   by the SOM prediction models based on GE-S and SS-S; the SOM prediction
   model based on GR-S exhibits the lowest accuracy; (2) among the
   different input variables, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and
   coefficient of determination (R2) of the best SOM model predicted by
   SCPs are 5.18 g kg(-1) and 0.89, respectively. Compared with the
   original reflectance based on the nonstratified strategy, the RMSE
   decreases by 4.88 g kg(-\& nbsp;1) and R(2 )increases by 0.32. The study
   results highlight the advantages of refining the soil hierarchy, which
   is helpful for identifying the differences in soils at the regional
   scale and analysing the relationship between stratification results and
   the characteristics of the soil environment to obtain a highly accurate
   prediction model.},

Abstract = {In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of
   network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the
   6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key
   elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial
   intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of
   network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision
   and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and
   user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates
   AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and
   AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network
   virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed
   architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the
   interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between
   model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between
   virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability,
   adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify
   challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By
   providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and
   developments on the potential architecture of 6G.},

Abstract = {Accurate extraction of farmland boundaries is crucial for improving the
   efficiency of farmland surveys, achieving precise agricultural
   management, enhancing farmers' production conditions, protecting the
   ecological environment, and promoting local economic development. Remote
   sensing and deep learning are feasible methods for creating large-scale
   farmland boundary maps. However, existing neural network models have
   limitations that restrict the accuracy and reliability of agricultural
   parcel extraction using remote sensing technology. In this study, we
   used high-resolution satellite images (2 m, 1 m, and 0.8 m) and the
   U-2-Net++ model based on the RSU module, deep separable convolution, and
   the channel-spatial attention mechanism module to extract different
   types of fields. Our model exhibited significant improvements in
   farmland parcel extraction compared with the other models. It achieved
   an F1-score of 97.13\%, which is a 7.36\% to 17.63\% improvement over
   older models such as U-Net and FCN and a more than 2\% improvement over
   advanced models such as DeepLabv3+ and U-2-Net. These results indicate
   that U-2-Net++ holds the potential for widespread application in the
   production of large-scale farmland boundary maps.},

Abstract = {Background There is no international consensus on how to manage women
   with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). Objectives To present a
   systematic quantitative review summarising the evidence related to
   management protocols for PUL. Search strategy MEDLINE, COCHRANE and DARE
   databases were searched from 1 January 1984 to 31 January 2017. The
   primary outcome was accurate risk prediction of women initially
   diagnosed with a PUL having an ectopic pregnancy (high risk) as opposed
   to either a failed PUL or intrauterine pregnancy (low risk). Selection
   criteria All studies written in the English language, which were not
   case reports or series that assessed women classified as having a PUL at
   initial ultrasound. Data collection and analysis Forty-three studies
   were included. QUADAS-2 criteria were used to assess the risk of bias.
   We used a novel, linear mixed-effects model and constructed summary
   receiver operating characteristic curves for the thresholds of interest.
   Main results There was a high risk of differential verification bias in
   most studies. Meta-analyses of accuracy were performed on (i) single
   human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) cut-off levels, (ii) hCG ratio (hCG
   at 48 hours/initial hCG), (iii) single progesterone cut-off levels and
   (iv) the `M4 model' (a logistic regression model based on the initial
   hCG and hCG ratio). For predicting an ectopic pregnancy, the areas under
   the curves (95\% CI) for these four management protocols were as
   follows: (i) 0.42 (0.00-0.99), (ii) 0.69 (0.57-0.78), (iii) 0.69
   (0.54-0.81) and (iv) 0.87 (0.83-0.91), respectively. Conclusions The M4
   model was the best available method for predicting a final outcome of
   ectopic pregnancy. Developing and validating risk prediction models may
   optimise the management of PUL.},

Title = {Using the ARCADIA/Capella Systems Engineering Method and Tool to Design
   Manufacturing Systems-Case Study and Industrial Feedback},
Journal = {SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In a trend towards digital continuity, model-based systems engineering
   is becoming widely adopted for the design of complex systems, supporting
   system development from the very first stages. A narrow panel of methods
   and tools are available on the market; they offer different scopes and
   approaches, are more or less intuitive to follow, and are sometimes
   supported by tools. Among them, the Architecture Analysis \& Design
   Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) is becoming popular and is gradually
   spreading in different industrial fields to model a wide variety of
   systems at different stages of their development and from different
   points of view. It is implemented using an open-source tool called
   Capella. Few feedback on its use in industrial settings have been
   published, while other feedback remains confidential. The goal of this
   paper is to analyze the interests and limitations of ARCADIA/Capella. To
   reach this goal, we experimented with ARCADIA/Capella in several
   projects and chose one to explain how the method and tool proceeded. In
   addition, we conducted a survey to obtain industrial feedback. As a
   result, the paper gives an overview of the relevance of ARCADIA/Capella
   in projects and of its usefulness, effectiveness, and adaptability in
   modeling different types of systems. It also provides some perspectives
   for the evolution of the method and the tool according to industrial
   feedback.},

Abstract = {Predictive maintenance for power electronic converters has emerged as a
   critical area of research and development. With the rapid advancements
   in deep-learning techniques, new possibilities have emerged for
   enhancing the performance and reliability of power converters. However,
   addressing challenges related to data resources, physical consistency,
   and generalizability has become crucial in achieving optimal strategies.
   This comprehensive review article presents an insightful overview of the
   recent advancements in the field of predictive maintenance for power
   converters. It explores three paradigms: model-based approaches,
   data-driven techniques, and the emerging concept of physics-informed
   machine learning (PIML). By leveraging the integration of physical
   knowledge into machine-learning architectures, PIML holds great promise
   for overcoming the aforementioned concerns. Drawing upon the current
   state-of-art, this review identifies common trends, practical
   challenges, and significant research opportunities in the domain of
   predictive maintenance for power converters. The analysis covers a broad
   spectrum of approaches used for parameter identification, feature
   engineering, fault detection, and remaining useful life estimation. This
   article not only provides a comprehensive survey of recent methodologies
   but also highlights future trends, serving as a resource for researchers
   and practitioners involved in the development of predictive maintenance
   strategies for power converters.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sea level rise is an important and topical issue in the South Pacific
   region and needs an urgent assessment of trends for informed decision
   making. This paper presents mean sea level trend assessment using
   harmonic analysis and a hybrid deep learning (DL) model based on the
   Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise
   (CEEMDAN) technique, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent
   Unit (GRU) and Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) to build a highly
   accurate sea level forecasting model for three small islands (Fiji,
   Marshall Island and Papua New Guinea (PNG)) in the South Pacific. For a
   20-year period, the estimated mean sea level rise per year from the
   harmonic computation is obtained: 112 mm for PNG, 98 mm for Marshall
   Island and 52 mm for Fiji. The DL procedure uses climate and
   environment-based remote sensing satellite (MODIS, GLDAS-2.0, MODIS
   TERRA, MERRA-2) predictor variables with tide gauge base mean sea level
   (MSL) data for model training and development for forecasting. The
   developed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU as the objective model is benchmarked by
   comparison to the hybrid model without data decomposition, CNN-GRU and
   standalone models, Decision Trees (DT) and Support Vector Regression
   (SVR). All model performances are evaluated using reliable statistical
   metrics. The CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU shows superior accuracy when compared with
   other standalone and hybrid models. It shows an accuracy of >96\% for
   correlation coefficient and an error of <1\% for all study sites.},

Abstract = {The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) observes the
   polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the angular scales of 1
   degrees less than or similar to theta <= 90 degrees with the aim of
   characterizing primordial gravitational waves and cosmic reionization.
   We report on the on-sky performance of the CLASS Q-band (40 GHz), W-band
   (90 GHz), and dichroic G-band (150/220 GHz) receivers that have been
   operational at the CLASS site in the Atacama desert since 2016 June,
   2018 May, and 2019 September, respectively. We show that the
   noise-equivalent power measured by the detectors matches the expected
   noise model based on on-sky optical loading and lab-measured detector
   parameters. Using Moon, Venus, and Jupiter observations, we obtain power
   to antenna temperature calibrations and optical efficiencies for the
   telescopes. From the CMB survey data, we compute instantaneous array
   noise-equivalent-temperature sensitivities of 22, 19, 23, and 71 mu
   K-cmp root s for the 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz frequency bands,
   respectively. These noise temperatures refer to white noise amplitudes,
   which contribute to sky maps at all angular scales. Future papers will
   assess additional noise sources impacting larger angular scales.},

Title = {Dissolved organic carbon trends resulting from changes in atmospheric

Abstract = {Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain recent, widespread
   increases in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the
   surface waters of glaciated landscapes across eastern North America and
   northern and central Europe(1-3). Some invoke anthropogenic forcing
   through mechanisms related to climate change(3-5), nitrogen
   deposition(6) or changes in land use(7), and by implication suggest that
   current concentrations and fluxes are without precedent. All of these
   hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with
   unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively,
   it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward
   pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate
   content of atmospheric deposition(8-10). Here we show, through the
   assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in
   North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between
   1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely
   on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We
   demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the
   rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea
   salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems
   has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the
   rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent
   decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may
   have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important
   component of regional carbon balances(11). The increase in DOC
   concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic
   factors.},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been much research into effective representation and
   analysis of uncertainty in human responses, with applications in
   cyber-security, forest and wildlife management, and product development,
   to name a few. Most of this research has focused on representing the
   response uncertainty as intervals, e.g., ``I give the movie between 2
   and 4 stars.{''} In this paper, we extend upon the model-based interval
   agreement approach (IAA) for combining interval data into fuzzy sets and
   propose the efficient IAA (eIAA) algorithm, which enables efficient
   representation of and operation on the fuzzy sets produced by IAA (and
   other interval-based approaches, for that matter). We develop methods
   for efficiently modeling, representing, and aggregating both crisp and
   uncertain interval data (where the interval endpoints are intervals
   themselves). These intervals are assumed to be collected from individual
   or multiple survey respondents over single or repeated surveys;
   although, without loss of generality, the approaches put forth in this
   paper could be used for any interval-based data where representation and
   analysis is desired. The proposed method is designed to minimize loss of
   information when transferring the interval-based data into fuzzy set
   models and then when projecting onto a compressed set of basis
   functions. We provide full details of eIAA and demonstrate it on
   real-world and synthetic data.},

Title = {Resolving the molecular gas around the lensed quasar RXJ0911.4+0551},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {552},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We report on high angular resolution observations of the CO(7-6) line
   and millimeter continuum in the host galaxy of the gravitationally
   lensed (z similar to 2.8) quasar RXJ0911.4+0551 using the Plateau de
   Bure Interferometer. Our CO observations resolve the molecular disk of
   the source. Using a lens model based on HST observations, we fit source
   models to the observed visibilities. We estimate a molecular disk radius
   of 1 +/- 0.2 kpc and an inclination of 69 +/- 6 deg, the continuum is
   more compact and is only marginally resolved by our observations. The
   relatively low molecular gas mass, M-gas = (2.3 +/- 0.5) x 10(9)
   M-circle dot, and far-infrared (FIR) luminosity, L-FIR = (7.2 +/- 1.5) x
   10(11) L-circle dot, of this quasar could be explained by its relatively
   low dynamical mass, M-dyn = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10(9) M-circle dot. It would
   be a scaled-down version the quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) usually found
   at high-z. The FIR and CO luminosities lie on the correlation found for
   QSOs from low to high redshifts and the gas-to-dust ratio (45 +/- 17) is
   similar to the one measured in the z = 6.4 QSO, SDSS J1148+5251.
   Differential magnification affects the continuum-to-line luminosity
   ratio, the line profile, and possibly the spectral energy distribution.},

Title = {Detecting latent topics and trends of digital twins in healthcare: A
   structural topic model-based systematic review},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {ObjectiveDigital twins (DTs) have received widespread attention
   recently, providing new ideas and possibilities for future healthcare.
   This review aims to provide a quantitative review to analyze specific
   study contents, research focus, and trends of DT in healthcare.
   Simultaneously, this review intends to expand the connotation of
   ``healthcare{''} into two directions, namely ``Disease treatment{''} and
   ``Health enhancement{''} to analyze the content within the ``DT +
   healthcare{''} field thoroughly.MethodsA data mining method named
   Structure Topic Modeling (STM) was used as the analytical tool due to
   its topic analysis ability and versatility. Google Scholar, Web of
   Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure supplied the
   material papers in this review.ResultsA total of 94 high-quality papers
   published between 2018 and 2022 were gathered and categorized into eight
   topics, collectively covering the transformative impact across a broader
   spectrum in healthcare. Three main findings have emerged: (1) papers
   published in healthcare predominantly concentrate on technology
   development (artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc.) and
   application scenarios(personalized, precise, and real-time health
   service); (2) the popularity of research topics is influenced by various
   factors, including policies, COVID-19, and emerging technologies; and
   (3) the preference for topics is diverse, with a general inclination
   toward the attribute of ``Health enhancement.{''}ConclusionsThis review
   underscores the significance of real-time capability and accuracy in
   shaping the future of DT, where algorithms and data transmission methods
   assume central importance in achieving these goals. Moreover,
   technological advancements, such as omics and Metaverse, have opened up
   new possibilities for DT in healthcare. These findings contribute to the
   existing literature by offering quantitative insights and valuable
   guidance to keep researchers ahead of the curve.},

Title = {The Prognostic Signature and Potential Target Genes of Six Long
   Non-coding RNA in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Studies have shown that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) may act as the
   carcinogenic factor or tumor suppressor of laryngeal squamous cell
   carcinoma (LSCC). This study aims to identify the prognostic value and
   potential target protein-coding genes (PCGs) of lncRNAs in LSCC. The
   LSCC datasets were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
   Statistical and bioinformatic methods were used to establish and
   evaluate the prognostic model, identify the correlation between lncRNAs
   and clinical characteristics, and screen for PCGs co-expressed with
   lncRNAs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified
   PCG modules associated with clinical characteristics. The expression of
   lncRNAs and PCGs was analyzed using our LSCC patients by RT-qPCR.
   LINC02154, LINC00528, SPRY4-AS1, TTTY14, LNCSRLR, and KLHL7-DT were
   selected to establish the prognostic model. The overall survival (OS) of
   low-risk patients forecasted by the model was significantly better than
   high-risk patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
   concordance index (C-index) validated the accuracy of the prognostic
   model. Chi-square test showed that six lncRNAs were associated with one
   of the clinical characteristics, i.e., gender, clinical stage, T and N
   stage, respectively. WGCNA identified PCG modules associated with
   gender, clinical stage, T and N stage. We took the intersection of the
   PCG modules of WGCNA, the differentially expressed PCGs between LSCC and
   normal samples, and the PCGs co-expressed with six lncRNAs. The
   intersection PCGs survival analysis showed that four PCGs, i.e., STC2,
   TSPAN9, SMS, and TCEA3 affected the OS of LSCC. More importantly, the
   differential expression of six lncRNAs and four PCGs between LSCC and
   normal samples was verified by our LSCC patients. In conclusion, we
   successfully established a prognostic model based on six-lncRNA
   RiskScore and initially screened the potential target PCGs of six
   lncRNAs for further basic and clinical research.},

Title = {A boundary and voxel-based 3D geological data management system
   leveraging BIM and GIS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Geological information is a prerequisite of civil engineering
   infrastructure projects. However, the modeling, representation, update,
   and exchange of geological information are challenging because they are
   managed by heterogeneous data models supported by two-dimensional (2D)
   representation that lacks volumetric information, 3D visualization, and
   integration. This study presents a novel geological data model using BIM
   and GIS to facilitate three-dimensional (3D) modeling and management of
   geological information. The proposed geological data model contains
   significant geometric, semantic, and spatial information, for which the
   IFC and CityGML ADE is extended. The BIM and GIS data has been mapped
   using IFC and CityGML. Moreover, the proposed geological data model uses
   a boundary and voxel geometric representation for the geological data.
   Algorithms are developed to create an efficient 3D geological boundary
   and voxel model based on the developed geological data model.
   Furthermore, the voxel size, number, and attributes can be updated
   efficiently, enabling the representation of geological information at
   different scales. Subsequently, the proposed BIM-GIS framework is
   demonstrated in a case study using geotechnical investigation data from
   a city. A questionnaire survey was conducted to verify the practical
   implications of the proposed method. Consequently, it was found that the
   proposed method improves geological data management efficiency and the
   geological information exchange process, which further facilitates the
   analysis by providing effective 3D visualization, inhomogeneous
   geological information, and enhancing integration.},

Abstract = {Simulation and Virtualization of robotic systems and Autonomous Guides
   Vehicle (AGV) is one of the most important aspects in the future
   development of such systems. This paper will contribute a framework and
   an entire toolchain to present a holistic and systematic approach for
   development of future robotic AGV systems. In the first section this
   paper will present the first descriptive study which is the literature
   survey and the definition of the scientific gaps and research questions
   related to systematic approaches based on Systems Engineering and Model
   Based System Engineering. In section number two this paper will present
   a new approach and framework called ``Munich Agile Concept for Modell
   based Systems Engineering (MAGIC){''} to develop entire virtual tool
   chains for virtualization and simulation of different functions in a
   virtual environment. This aspect is one of the important contributions
   of this paper. MBSE is based on three important core pillar which is 1)
   Methods/Processes, 2) Language and 3) Systems. The purpose of the new
   developed Munich Agile Concept Approach is to handle the complexity over
   the entire holistic information framework for simulation and
   virtualization of AGV function development from the system requirement
   definition process up to the test and validation of the system.
   Furthermore, with MAGIC there is a holistic approach and method to carry
   out the entire virtual development process by means of capable
   simulation and virtualization tools based on MAGICLOOP. The Munich Agile
   Concept contains six different levels which are System Requirement-,
   System Functional-, System Architecture-, System Validation-, System
   Test and the System-Usage-Level. For defining the first three-level, a
   graphical language called System Modelling Language (SysML) has been
   applied. The third chapter will apply the developed approach in an
   industrial Use Case which is based on simulation and virtualization of
   AGVs in a manufacturing environment. The last chapter will summaries the
   results of the applied Method. A lot of verification and testing are
   required robot and AGV development. ore the autonomous driving system
   can be deployed. However, testing in a real world will consume a lot of
   resources and may also bring security risks. Therefore, simulation is
   particularly important for autonomous driving systems.},

Abstract = {Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters, causing
   financial and human losses every year. As a result, reliable Flood
   Susceptibility Mapping (FSM) is required for effective flood management
   and reducing its harmful effects. In this study, a new machine learning
   model based on the Cascade Forest Model (CFM) was developed for FSM.
   Satellite imagery, historical reports, and field data were used to
   determine flood-inundated areas. The database included 21
   flood-conditioning factors obtained from different sources. The
   performance of the proposed CFM was evaluated over two study areas, and
   the results were compared with those of other six machine learning
   methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT),
   Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Light Gradient Boosting
   Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical
   Boosting (CatBoost). The result showed CFM produced the highest accuracy
   compared to other models over both study areas. The Overall Accuracy
   (AC), Kappa Coefficient (KC), and Area Under the Receiver Operating
   Characteristic Curve (AUC) of the proposed model were more than 95\%,
   0.8, 0.95, respectively. Most of these models recognized the
   southwestern part of the Karun basin, northern and northwestern regions
   of the Gorganrud basin as susceptible areas.},

Title = {Do Chinese Children Get Enough Micronutrients?},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine usual daily micronutrient intake of
   Chinese children based on data from the 2011 China Health and Nutrition
   Survey. We analyzed data from 4 to 17-year-old participants, who
   provided dietary data on three consecutive days combined with the
   household weighing method in 2011. Usual daily intake of each nutrient
   was estimated using a mixed effects model based on the China Food
   Composition published in 2009. The means, medians and percentages below
   Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) were reported for selected
   micronutrients, including calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, zinc,
   selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin C. For sodium and
   potassium, the means and the distribution of intakes were compared to
   the Adequate Intake (AI) level. The average usual daily intakes of all
   micronutrients increase with age, and the intakes of boys were found to
   be higher than girls in the same age group. The average calcium intake
   increased from 272 mg/day in 4-6 years to 391 mg/day in 14-17 years, but
   the percentage of inadequate calcium intake remained very high (> 96\%).
   The prevalence of inadequacy of calcium was the highest among the
   mineral nutrients reported in this study. As the requirements of
   micronutrients increased with age, the percentage of subjects with
   inadequate intake increased in the 11-17 years age groups. Among 14-17
   years group, the percentages of study participants with dietary intakes
   of calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin and
   vitamin C below the EAR were 96.8\%, 18.8\%, 37.6\%, 72.8\%, 36.8\%,
   91.8\%. 85.9\% and 75.5\%, respectively. Among 11-13 years group, the
   percentages of study participants with dietary intakes of iron, zinc and
   vitamin A below the EAR were 23.5\%, 41.5\%, and 41.6\%, respectively.
   Thus, micronutrient deficiency is a problem in Chinese children.
   Nutrition education and intervention programs are needed to address
   these nutritional gaps.},

Abstract = {The evolution from ``document-centric{''} to ``data-centric{''} and
   ``model-centric{''} information leveraging structured data and
   model-based approaches is at the heart of digital engineering
   transformational efforts underway across industry and government. It is
   these approaches that pave the way for data lakes, Authoritative Sources
   of Truth (ASOTs), and systems-of-systems interoperability and the
   corresponding transformational benefits thereof. Such benefits include
   increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability,
   real-time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly)
   acceleration of the time-to-value and time-to-insights associated with
   engineering products and analyses. The longer-term benefits of
   reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.
   For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS)
   activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide
   engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support
   critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle. The SMA
   community often operate in parallel with engineering activities, for
   which information exchange with relevant context is paramount. Far too
   often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the
   robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated
   with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and
   reporting.
   This paper provides an overview of how NASA's Office of Safety and
   Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance,
   and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the
   benefits emerging in this new digital era. A roadmap for achieving this
   digital future is presented along with key building blocks involving use
   and implementation of concepts such as: Objectives-Hierarchies,
   Objective-Driven Requirements, Accepted Standards, Safety and Assurance
   Cases, data digitization (i.e., ontologies, structured data, and
   model-centric data), FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, \&
   Reusable) and/or FAIRUST (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable,
   Understandable, Secure, and Trusted) principles {[}1]. This paper also

Title = {A hybridized model based on neural network and swarm intelligence-grey
   wolf algorithm for spatial prediction of urban flood-inundation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {603},

Abstract = {In regions with lack of hydrological and hydraulic data, a spatial flood
   modeling and mapping is an opportunity for the urban authorities to
   predict the spatial distribution and the intensity of the flooding. It
   helps decision-makers to develop effective flood prevention and
   management plans. In this study, flood inventory data were prepared
   based on the historical and field surveys data by Sari municipality and
   regional water company of Mazandaran, Iran. The collected flood data
   accompanied with different variables (digital elevation model and slope
   have been considered as topographic variables, land use/land cover,
   precipitation, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel and
   depth to groundwater as environmental variables) were applied to novel
   hybridized model based on neural network and swarm intelligence-grey
   wolf algorithm (NN-SGW) to map flood-inundation. Several confusion
   matrix criteria were used for accuracy evaluation by cutoff-dependent
   and independent metrics (e.g., efficiency (E), positive predictive value
   (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUC)). The accuracy of the flood
   inundation map produced by the NN-SGW model was compared with that of
   maps produced by four state-of-the-art benchmark models: random forest
   (RF), logistic model tree (LMT), classification and regression trees
   (CART), and J48 decision tree (J48DT). The NN-SGW model outperformed all
   benchmark models in both training (E = 90.5\%, PPV = 93.7\%, NPV =
   87.3\%, AUC = 96.3\%) and validation (E = 79.4\%, PPV = 85.3\%, NPV =
   73.5\%, AUC = 88.2\%). As the NN-SGW model produced the most accurate
   flood-inundation map, it can be employed for robust flood contingency
   planning. Based on the obtained results from NN-SGW model, distance from
   channel, distance from river, and depth to groundwater were identified
   as the most important variables for spatial prediction of urban flood
   inundation. This work can serve as a basis for future studies seeking to
   predict flood susceptibility in urban areas using hybridized machine
   learning (ML) models and can also be applied in other urban areas where
   flood inundation presents a pressing challenge, and there are some
   problems regarding required model and availability of input data.},

Title = {Well-Logging Constraints on Gas Hydrate Saturation in Unconsolidated
   Fine-Grained Reservoirs in the Northern South China Sea},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recently, drilling wells have encountered rich gas hydrates in
   fine-grained sediments in the northern South China Sea. Gas hydrate in
   fine-grained sediments is very heterogeneous, and its physical
   properties are different from those of oil and gas reservoirs. The
   reliability of the classical logging saturation evaluation models
   established for diagenetic reservoirs is questionable. This study used
   four wells in GMGS3 and GMGS4 to evaluate the effects of the application
   of three typical methods for evaluating saturation with different
   principles in the unconsolidated fine-grained sediments: nuclear
   magnetic logging, sigma logging, and the Archie formula. It was found
   that the value of the lithologic capture cross-section in sigma logging
   and the rock's electrical parameters in the Archie formula affect the
   accuracy of the model. Therefore, to obtain a reliable saturation value
   for fine-grained sediments, an innovative method for the calculation of
   resistivity and acoustic time is proposed to estimate gas hydrate
   saturation based on logging data, which is most consistent with the
   results of core analysis. The overall relative error of the verification
   well was 5.87\%, whereas that of the density NMR logging method was
   56\%, showing that the accuracy of the newly proposed resistivity DT
   logging method's saturation formula was significantly improved. Finally,
   a new model-based cross chart was developed, which can rapidly
   differentiate gas saturation during drilling.},

Title = {Analysis of the Principal Factors Affecting the Algae Growth in an Urban
   Eutrophic Shallow Lake by an Ecosystem Model},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {231},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {The growth of algae in eutrophic lakes is greatly influenced by the
   various factors such as nutrients, water temperature, and solar
   radiation intensity. In order to manage and maintain the ecosystem in
   the lakes, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the nutrients
   as well as the factors affecting the algae growth seasonally. In this
   study, an ecosystem model based on the genetic algorithm (GA) for the
   optimization of the parameters during the model validation was developed
   to simulate the growth of algae groups (green algae, blue-green algae,
   and diatom algae) and analyze the principal factors affecting their
   growth in a eutrophic shallow lake in the inner Hanoi City. The survey
   of each algal group and other related variables of water quality were
   conducted from May 2017 to March 2018 to calibrate and verify the
   developed model. The principal factors affecting the algae growth were
   evaluated through the functions that limit their growth. Seasonal
   variation in the production components (including diffusion from
   sediment, atmosphere, and algae excretion) and consumption
   (photosynthesis) of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) are also
   quantified. Moreover, the model developed in this study promises to be a
   useful tool to simulate the relationship between algae biomass and
   nutrient concentration, as well as forecasting changes in composition
   and density of algae in the eutrophic lakes.},

Title = {Forecasting Weed Distributions using Climate Data: A GIS Early Warning

Journal = {INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The number of invasive exotic plant species establishing in the United
   States is continuing to rise. When prevention of exotic species from
   entering into a country fails at the national level and the species
   establishes, reproduces, spreads, and becomes invasive, the most
   successful action at a local level is early detection followed by
   eradication. We have developed a simple geographic information system
   (GIS) analysis for developing watch lists for early detection of
   invasive exotic plants that relies upon currently available species
   distribution data coupled with environmental data to aid in describing
   coarse-scale potential distributions. This GIS analysis tool develops
   environmental envelopes for species based upon the known distribution of
   a species thought to be invasive and represents the first approximation
   of its potential habitat while the necessary data are collected to
   perform more in-depth analyses. To validate this method we looked at a
   time series of species distributions for 66 species in Pacific Northwest
   and northern Rocky Mountain counties. The time series analysis presented
   here did select counties that the invasive exotic weeds invaded in
   subsequent years, showing that this technique could be useful in
   developing watch lists for the spread of particular exotic species. We
   applied this same habitat-matching model based upon bioclimatic
   envelopes to 100 invasive exotics with various levels of known
   distributions within continental U.S. counties. For species with
   climatically limited distributions, county watch lists describe
   county-specific vulnerability to invasion. Species with matching
   habitats in a county would be added to that county's list. These watch
   lists can influence management decisions for early warning, control
   prioritization, and targeted research to determine specific locations
   within vulnerable counties. This tool provides useful information for
   rapid assessment of the potential distribution based upon climate
   envelopes of current distributions for new invasive exotic species.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, notable progress has been made in the performance
   of airborne geophysical systems for mapping and detection of unexploded
   ordnance in terrestrial and shallow marine environments. For
   magnetometer systems, the most significant improvements include
   development of denser magnetometer arrays and vertical gradiometer
   configurations. In prototype analyses and recent Environmental Security
   Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) assessments using new
   production systems the greatest sensitivity has been achieved with a
   vertical gradiometer configuration, despite model-based survey design
   results which suggest that dense total-field arrays would be superior.
   As effective as magnetometer systems have proven to be at many sites,
   they are inadequate at sites where basalts and other ferrous geologic
   formations or soils produce anomalies that approach or exceed those of
   target ordnance items. Additionally, magnetometer systems are
   ineffective where detection of non-ferrous ordnance items is of primary
   concern. Recent completion of the Battelle TEM-8 airborne time-domain
   electromagnetic system represents the culmination of nearly nine years
   of assessment and development of airborne electromagnetic systems for
   UXO mapping and detection. A recent ESTCP demonstration of this system
   in New Mexico showed that it was able to detect 99\% of blind-seeded
   ordnance items, 81mm and larger, and that it could be used to map in
   detail a bombing target on a basalt flow where previous airborne
   magnetometer surveys had failed. The probability of detection for the
   TEM-8 in the blind-seeded study area was better than that reported for a
   dense-array total-field magnetometer demonstration of the same
   blind-seeded site, and the TEM-8 system successfully detected these
   items with less than half as many anomaly picks as the dense-array
   total-field magnetometer system.
   Overall, improvements in airborne geophysical systems over the past ten
   years have led to the capability of detecting smaller ordnance with
   fewer false positives. These trends should continue as more
   technological advances are made.},

Abstract = {Exchanges between coastal regions and the open ocean are often
   associated with intermittent and localized processes such as eddies,
   fronts, and filaments. Since these features are difficult to observe,
   their impact has been predominantly investigated using numerical models
   and remote sensing. In this study, satellite sea surface temperature
   maps, Lagrangian surface drifter trajectories, and ship-based surveys of
   currents and hydrography from the Latex10 campaign are used to quantify
   cross-shelf exchanges associated with a temperature front in the western
   Gulf of Lion. Satellite imagery and thermosalinograph sections provide
   the characterization of the various water masses associated with the
   front. Lagrangian drifter trajectories are used to identify the main
   transport structures and to quantify the velocity components associated
   with near-inertial oscillations. These are removed from the
   instantaneous ADCP observations with which the cross-shelf exchanges are
   then computed. The results indicate an average outflow of 0.0740.013 Sv
   and an inflow of 0.0210.006 Sv. Integrated over the 2 week lifetime of
   the front, such outflow induced a total export of approximate to 9014
   km(3) of water, indicating that three to four of such events are
   sufficient to completely renew the surface waters of the Gulf of Lion.
   The total import was approximate to 257 km(3), suggesting larger inflows
   at depth or in the eastern part of the gulf to maintain its volume
   balance. These in situ estimates represent a key term of comparison for
   the further development of numerical model-based and satellite-based
   studies of cross-shelf exchanges associated with this type of processes.},

Title = {Multi-algorithm based Gaussian mixture model applied to crack
   classification of cemented tailings backfill containing initial defects},
Journal = {POWDER TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {436},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Crack classification of the rupture process of the cemented tailings
   backfill (CTB) is important for whole-life monitoring and timely support
   of the stability of the mine's airspace. To investigate the effect of
   initial defects on the damage crack classification of the CTB, different
   contents of air-entraining agent (AEA) were added during the
   manufacturing process of the CTB to simulate the generation of different
   degrees of initial defects inside the CTB. Uniaxial compression and
   acoustic emission monitoring tests were conducted on CTB with different
   AEA contents using MTS microcomputer-controlled electronic universal
   testing machine and Micro-II Express Digital AE System. A Gaussian
   hybrid crack classification model based on EM algorithm, K-means
   algorithm, and moving average filtering method was established, and the
   crack classification results of RA-AF analysis method for conventional
   crack classification and Gaussian hybrid model were compared and
   analyzed. The results show that the addition of AEA makes the CTB
   dominated by shear cracks in the compaction stage. The dominance of the
   two types of cracks in the intermediate loading stage appears to be
   switched twice. The increase of the percentage of shear cracks has a
   certain hysteresis effect with the increase of the content of AEA. The
   percentage of shear cracks in the CTB in the intermediate and final
   loading stages also increases. The results not only address the
   challenge of determining the segmentation line for conventional crack
   classification but also enable real-time prediction of CTB crack
   evolution underground in mines.},

Title = {Inversion analysis of soil nitrogen content using hyperspectral images
   with different preprocessing methods},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral data can provide accurate
   and detailed spectral information on the surface of features, leading to
   a better understanding of the physiological characteristics and optical
   properties of objects. Compared to satellite hyperspectral, UAV
   hyperspectral has a greater image spatial resolution, but it also
   collects more impurity information along with more image detail
   information. The nitrogen (N) content in shallow soils is of great
   significance for crop growth, and most of its remote sensing inversions
   are currently based on satellite images, whereas relatively few studies
   have used hyperspectral UAV images in the near-infrared band for
   inversions. Based on this, we propose a high-accuracy inversion model
   based on UAV hyper-spectral imagery using an elastic net (EN)
   dimensionality reduction algorithm combined with a decision tree (DT)
   model. In this study, a hyperspectral imager carried by a drone was used
   to acquire the surface soil spectral data of winter wheat in the study
   area after sowing and fertilizing, and the measured N content of the
   sampled soil was determined by chemical analysis methods. We used
   various pre-processing methods to denoise and reduce the dimensionality
   of the original hyperspectral images and utilized a DT regression model
   to construct an inversion model of N content with different
   preprocessing results. Then we compared the accuracy of the models and
   used the optimal model to obtain the spatial distribution map of soil N
   content in the study area. The results show that (1) the dimensionality
   reduction of hyperspectral data can effectively remove redundant
   information and prevent data overfitting. Among them, the successive
   projections algorithm and correlation analysis method are more suitable
   for analyzing pre-processed spectral data, whereas the Lasso and EN
   algorithms are more suitable for processing original spectral data. (2)
   For the original spectral images, the EN dimensionality reduction
   algorithm (R2 of the EN-Unt-DT inversion model is 0.930, RMSE is 0.045)
   performed better than the other three algorithms. For the pre-processed
   spectral images, the successive projections algorithm (R2 of the
   SPA-Pre-DT inversion model is 0.906, RMSE is 0.055) performed better
   than the other three algorithms. The constructed EN-Unt-DT inversion
   model had the highest fitting accuracy. The research results provide a
   corre-sponding technical reference for the inversion of soil N content
   using UAV NIR hyperspectral data.},

Title = {Ensemble learning framework for landslide susceptibility mapping:
   Different basic classifier and ensemble strategy},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The application of ensemble learning models has been continuously
   improved in recent landslide suscep-tibility research, but most studies
   have no unified ensemble framework. Moreover, few papers have dis-cussed
   the applicability of the ensemble learning model in landslide
   susceptibility mapping at the township level. This study aims at
   defining a robust ensemble framework that can become the bench-mark
   method for future research dealing with the comparison of different
   ensemble models. For this pur-pose, the present work focuses on three
   different basic classifiers: decision tree (DT), support vector machine
   (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) and two
   homogeneous ensemble models such as random forest (RF) and extreme
   gradient boosting (XGBoost). The hierarchical construction of deep
   ensemble relied on two leading ensemble technologies (i.e.,
   homogeneous/hetero-geneous model ensemble and bagging, boosting,
   stacking ensemble strategy) to provide a more accurate and effective
   spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The selected study area is
   Dazhou town, located in the Jurassic red-strata area in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir Area of China, which is a strategic economic area currently
   characterized by widespread landslide risk. Based on a long-term field
   investigation, the inventory counting thirty-three slow-moving landslide
   polygons was drawn. The results show that the ensemble models do not
   necessarily perform better; for instance, the Bagging based
   DT-SVM-MLPNN-XGBoost model performed worse than the single XGBoost
   model. Amongst the eleven tested models, the Stacking based RF-XGBoost
   model, which is a homogeneous model based on bagging, boosting, and
   stacking ensemble, showed the highest capability of predicting the
   landslide-affected areas. Besides, the factor behaviors of DT, SVM,
   MLPNN, RF and XGBoost models reflected the characteristics of
   slow-moving landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area, wherein
   unfavorable lithological conditions and intense human engineering
   activities (i.e., reservoir water level fluctuation, residential area
   construc-tion, and farmland development) are proven to be the key
   triggers. The presented approach could be used for landslide spatial
   occurrence prediction in similar regions and other fields.\& COPY; 2023

Abstract = {Landslides are a common geodynamic phenomenon that cause substantial
   life and property damage worldwide. In the present study, we developed
   models to evaluate landslide susceptibility in forest-covered areas in
   Lin'an, southeastern China using logistic regression (LR), decision tree
   (DT), and random forest (RF) techniques. In addition to conventional
   landslide-related natural and human disturbance factors, factors
   describing forest cover, including forest type (two plantations (hickory
   and bamboo) and four natural forests (conifer, hardwood, shrub, and moso
   bamboo) and understory vegetation conditions, were included as
   predictors. Model performance was evaluated based on true-positive rate,
   Kappa value, and area under the ROC curve using a 10-fold
   cross-validation method. All models exhibited good performance with
   measures of >= 0.70, although the LR model was relatively inferior. The
   key predictors were forest type, understory vegetation height (UVH),
   normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in summer, distance to
   road (DTRD), and maximum daily rainfall (MDR). Hickory plantations
   yielded the highest landslide probability, while conifer and hardwood
   forests had the lowest values. Bamboo plantations had probability
   results comparable to those of natural forests. Using the RF model,
   areas with a shorter UVH (<1.2 m), a lower NDVI (<0.70), a heavier MDR
   (>115 mm), or a shorter DTRD (<500 m) were predicted to be
   landslide-prone. Information on forest cover is essential for predicting
   landslides in areas with rich forest cover, and conversion from natural
   forests to plantations could increase landslide risk. Across the study
   areas, the northwestern part was the most landslide-prone. In terms of
   landslide prevention, the RF model-based map produced the most accurate
   predictions for the ``very high{''} category of landslide. These results
   will help us better understand landslide occurrences in forest-covered
   areas and provide valuable information for governments in designing
   disaster mitigation.},

Abstract = {In complex human-computer interactions, issues such as task failures,
   system malfunctions, and frequent accidents caused by user errors are
   common. Therefore, it is necessary to study complex system interactions
   to enhance overall efficiency. This study focuses on the task interface
   of a digital twin system for computer numerical control (CNC) machine
   tools and examines the relationship between the user mental model and
   interface design elements. Key mental information is obtained through
   questionnaires and interviews, forming the basis for establishing a user
   mental model. High-frequency information words are extracted,
   experimental samples are designed, and importance rating surveys are
   conducted. Quantitative analysis methods, including factor analysis and
   weight calculation, are utilized to analyze the needs of target users.
   Consequently, a user demand hierarchy model is constructed. This
   approach aims to effectively reduce user errors in the human-computer
   interaction process within complex systems and enhance cognitive

Title = {Projecting the effects of tobacco control policies in the USA through
   microsimulation: a study protocol},

Abstract = {Introduction Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in
   the USA but can be reduced through policy interventions. Computational
   models of smoking can provide estimates of the projected impact of
   tobacco control policies and can be used to inform public health
   decision making. We outline a protocol for simulating the effects of
   tobacco policies on population health outcomes.
   Methods and analysis We extend the Smoking History Generator (SHG), a
   rnicrosirnulation model based on data from the National Health Interview
   Surveys, to evaluate the effects of tobacco control policies on
   projections of smoking prevalence and mortality in the USA. The SHG
   simulates individual life trajectories including smoking initiation,
   cessation arid mortality. We illustrate the application of the SHG
   policy module for four types of tobacco control policies at the national
   and state levels: smoke-free air laws, cigarette taxes, increasing
   tobacco control programme expenditures and raising the minimum age of
   legal access to tobacco. Smoking initiation and cessation rates are
   modified by age, birth cohort, gender arid years since policy
   implementation. Initiation and cessation rate modifiers are adjusted for
   differences across age groups and the level of existing policy coverage.
   Smoking prevalence, the number of population deaths avoided, and
   life-years gained are calculated for each policy scenario at the
   national and state levels. The model only considers direct individual
   benefits through reduced smoking and does not consider benefits through
   reduced exposure to secondhand smoke.
   Ethics and dissemination A web-based interface is being developed to
   integrate the results of the simulations into a format that allows the
   user to explore the projected effects of tobacco control policies in the
   USA. Usability testing is being conducted in which experts provide
   feedback on the interface. Development of this tool is under way, arid a
   publicly accessible website is available at
   http://www.tobaccopolicyeffects.org.},

Abstract = {Background Across low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), one in
   ten deaths in children younger than 5 years is attributable to
   diarrhoea. The substantial between-country variation in both diarrhoea
   incidence and mortality is attributable to interventions that protect
   children, prevent infection, and treat disease. Identifying subnational
   regions with the highest burden and mapping associated risk factors can
   aid in reducing preventable childhood diarrhoea.
   Methods We used Bayesian model-based geostatistics and a geolocated
   dataset comprising 15 072 746 children younger than 5 years from 466
   surveys in 94 LMICs, in combination with findings of the Global Burden
   of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, to estimate
   posterior distributions of diarrhoea prevalence, incidence, and
   mortality from 2000 to 2017. From these data, we estimated the burden of
   diarrhoea at varying subnational levels (termed units) by spatially
   aggregating draws, and we investigated the drivers of subnational
   patterns by creating aggregated risk factor estimates.
   Findings The greatest declines in diarrhoeal mortality were seen in
   south and southeast Asia and South America, where 54.0\% (95\%
   uncertainty interval {[}UI] 38.1-65.8), 17.4\% (7.7-28.4), and 59.5\%
   (34.2-86.9) of units, respectively, recorded decreases in deaths from
   diarrhoea greater than 10\%. Although children in much of Africa remain
   at high risk of death due to diarrhoea, regions with the most deaths
   were outside Africa, with the highest mortality units located in
   Pakistan. Indonesia showed the greatest within-country geographical
   inequality; some regions had mortality rates nearly four times the
   average country rate. Reductions in mortality were correlated to
   improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) or reductions in
   child growth failure (CGF). Similarly, most high-risk areas had poor
   WASH, high CGF, or low oral rehydration therapy coverage.
   Interpretation By co-analysing geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden
   and its key risk factors, we could assess candidate drivers of
   subnational death reduction. Further, by doing a counterfactual analysis
   of the remaining disease burden using key risk factors, we identified
   potential intervention strategies for vulnerable populations. In view of
   the demands for limited resources in LMICs, accurately quantifying the
   burden of diarrhoea and its drivers is important for precision public
   health. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Assessing the use of surrogate species for a more cost-effective
   traceability of geographic origin using elemental fingerprints of
   bivalve shells},

Abstract = {Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major threat to
   marine ecosystems and their living resources. IUU fishing promotes
   fraudulent mislabeling of seafood, which can pose serious risks to
   consumers' health if specimens being traded originate from contaminated
   areas. The development and optimization of reliable tools to confirm the
   geographic origin of seafood is therefore of utmost importance under
   these scenarios. These tools are usually based in reference models of a
   given species that allows to trace the geographic origin of
   conspecifics. However, to date, the accuracy of such reference models
   requires the sampling of specimens of the species being surveyed, an
   issue that may impair the generalized use of this approach by
   authorities under real case scenarios. A potential way to overcome this
   constraint is to apply a model built for a given species (working as
   surrogate) to trace the geographic origin of another one. The present
   study evaluated the effect of species specific and spatial variability
   associated with the elemental fingerprints (EF) of shells of three
   commercially important bivalve species (Cerastoderma edule, Ruditapes
   decussatus and R. philippinarum) from five different locations over the
   northwestern and western Iberian coast and tested if a reference model
   based on one of this species could be used to reliably trace the
   geographic origin of specimens from the two other species. The EF of
   shells of the three species were significantly different within each
   location, as well as among different locations within each species. The
   reference models of the three species presented high cross-validation
   accuracy (ranging from 95.3\% to 99.3\%). The tests to infer if these
   models could reliably trace the geographic origin of samples from
   another species presented an overall accuracy ranging between 50\% and
   82.3\%. Based on these results, and other requirements that a surrogate
   species must fulfil, it is possible to conclude that the three species
   hold the potential to be used as surrogates of each other, although C.
   edule is the one that better fulfills the requirements of a surrogate
   species. The optimization proposed in this study improves the
   cost-efficiency of using EF of bivalve shells as a tool to trace and
   confirm the geographic origin of bivalves, while also allowing to
   deliver a prompter reply to authorities.},

Title = {Mapping age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence in adults in sub-Saharan
   Africa, 2000-2018},

Abstract = {BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden
   and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track
   to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations
   Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for
   effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and
   treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates
   are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local
   estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further
   dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at
   local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults
   ages 15-59 years across SSA.MethodsWe analyzed data from 91
   seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care
   clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to
   produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from
   years 2000 to 2018, at a 5x5-km resolution and presented among second
   administrative level (typically districts or counties) units.ResultsWe
   found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages,
   and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country
   variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across
   ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large
   within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50\%
   of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups
   with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference
   for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and
   2018, 70\% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than
   five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile,
   over 30\% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point
   prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.ConclusionsAs the
   HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic
   shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These
   estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide
   more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.},

Title = {SYNTHETIC AGB EVOLUTION .4. LONG-PERIOD VARIABLES IN THE LMC},

Abstract = {From observations of LPVs (long period variables) in the LMC we derive
   that the ratio of the number of C-rich LPVs to the total number of
   carbon stars is approximately 0.05 and that the ratio of the number of
   oxygen-rich LPVs to the total number of oxygen-rich AGB stars is between
   0.05 and 0.10. The lifetime of the LPV phase in the LMC is only a few
   10(4) yr, considerable below estimates for the Galaxy, where the
   duration of the LPV phase (about 2 10(5) yr) is similar to the total AGB
   lifetime. If the possible incompleteness of the surveys for LPVs is
   invoked to explain this discrepancy in the lifetimes then the ratio of
   small amplitude variables to large amplitude variables must be about 30,
   considerably larger than the ratio of Semi Regular to Mira variables in
   the Galaxy (1-3).
   We present a simple model to explain the observed properties of LPVs in
   the LMC. It is assumed that pulsation only occurs in an instability
   strip in the HR diagram. The instability strip is characterised by three
   parameters: the temperature at some reference luminosity, the width of
   the instability strip and its slope dT(eff)/dM(bol). The first two are
   free parameters in the model. Based on observations we use
   dT(eff)/dM(bol) = 275 K mag-1 for M(bol) > -5 and 100 K mag-1 for M(bol)
   < -5. An additional complication is that the pulsation period depends
   rather sensitively on the effective temperature scale. The location of
   the AGB tracks in the HR diagram (the zero point of the effective
   temperature scale) is the third free parameter.
   Both a model with a Reimers mass loss law inside and outside the
   instability strip, and a model with the mass loss in the instability
   strip given by a scaled version of the Blocker \& Schonberner (1993)
   mass loss law, fit the observational constraints equally well.
   We conclude that first harmonic pulsation can be excluded unless the
   canonical relation between (J - K) color and effective temperature
   (based on lunar occultation observations) gives temperatures which are
   too high by approximately 20\%, much larger than the estimated
   uncertainty of approximately 8\% or possible systematic effects
   (less-than-or-similar-to 10\%). Fundamental mode pulsation is therefore
   probably the dominant pulsation mode among LPVs in the LMC.
   A second conclusion is that for most stars the instability strip is not
   the final phase of AGB evolution. Based on our calculations for
   individual stars we find that AGB stars more massive than about 1.2M.
   spend a considerable amount of time in the phase between the end of
   pulsation and the end of the AGB.
   We propose an alternative explanation for (some of) the non-variable
   OH/IR stars in the Galaxy.},

Abstract = {Background High-resolution estimates of HIV burden across space and time
   provide an important tool for tracking and monitoring the progress of
   prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision
   and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence
   and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across
   sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the
   geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence
   surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV
   incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15-49 years. We used a
   model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the
   second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for
   2000-18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral
   therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the
   Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and
   treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by
   second-level administrative unit.
   Findings The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence
   and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan
   Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in
   estimated HIV incidence between the second- level administrative units
   with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44
   countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2.8 (95\% uncertainty
   interval 2.1-3.8) in Mauritania to 1585.9 (1369.4-1824.8) cases per 100
   000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0.8 (0.7-0.9) in
   Mauritania to 676.5 (513.6-888.0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho.
   Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at
   the subnational level than at the national level and the highest
   estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level
   administrative units, Guija District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the
   highest estimated HIV incidence (4661.7 {[}2544.8-8120.3]) cases per 100
   000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province,
   Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163.0
   {[}679.0-1866.8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of
   reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as
   the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was
   highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had
   declines in the number of new cases (3316 {[}81.1\%] of 4087 units) and
   number of deaths (3325 {[}81.4\%]), nearly all appeared well short of
   the targeted 75\% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and
   2020.
   Interpretation Our estimates suggest that most second-level
   administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the
   targeted 75\% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is
   further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These
   estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand
   access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden
   subnational areas. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {3D crowdsourced parametric cadastral mapping: Pathways integrating
   BIM/IFC, crowdsourced data and LADM},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned
   with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the
   collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D)
   property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information
   Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres
   and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building
   information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of
   all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as
   land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is
   still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs
   limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large
   constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact
   geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the
   exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common
   spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal
   legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the
   current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize
   the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to
   facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D
   cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of
   all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate
   markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a
   powerful data collection method for the initial participatory
   implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys,
   utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices,
   mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the
   international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO
   19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the
   currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional
   geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a
   participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In
   this paper a `two-route' crowdsourced approach is described. This
   approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs - those available - to
   proceed with 3D crowd -sourced cadastral surveys of those constructions,
   as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., ortho-photos for
   the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing
   architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D
   crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database
   schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D
   crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is
   developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the
   manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data - if existing; the collection
   of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property
   owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data
   and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the
   automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1),
   using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time,
   are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct
   representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing
   mainly in the Greek territory is conducted.
   A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the `two-route'
   crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in
   the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced
   solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy - in the absence of
   BIM - are dis-cussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM
   data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may
   significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres,
   providing also a better vi-sual understanding of 3D property rights.
   Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to
   satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the
   potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the
   cadastral formal procedures.},

Abstract = {A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate the
   performance of the area-threshold method of estimating mean areal
   rainfall. The study uses a stochastic space-time model of rainfall as
   the true rainfall-field generator. Simple schemes of simulating radar
   observations of the simulated rainfall fields are employed These schemes
   address both random and systematic components of the radar
   rainfall-estimation process. The results of the area-threshold method
   are compared to the results based on conventional averaging of
   radar-estimated point rainfall observations. The results demonstrate
   that when the exponent parameter in the Z-R relationship has small
   uncertainty (about +/-10\%), the conventional method works better than
   the area-threshold method. When the errors are higher (+/-20\%), the
   area-threshold method with optimum threshold in the 5-10 mm h-1 range
   performs best. For even higher errors in the Z-R relationship, the
   area-threshold method with a low threshold provides the best
   performance.},

Title = {Wave field predictions using a multi-layer perceptron and decision tree
   model based on physical principles: A case study at the Pearl River
   Estuary},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In this study, a novel data-driven model is proposed for efficient
   spatial-temporal forecasting of the significant wave height (SWH), mean
   wave period (MWP), and mean wave direction (MWD) in the Pearl River
   Estuary, located in Southern China, using machine learning. The model
   utilizes machine learning techniques and employs a multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) and decision tree (DT) based architecture following a
   matrix-to -matrix mapping strategy to establish the underlying
   spatial-temporal relationship between the wind and wave fields for
   four-day and ocean-scale forecasts. The training and testing of the
   model were carried out using long-term hindcast wave and wind datasets
   released by ERA5. A rectangular sea region covering an area of 5 degrees
   x 5 degrees in the Pearl River Estuary was regarded as the modeling
   domain. The data-driven model was validated against a 10 years of
   historical hindcast data, and the global errors were analyzed. The
   forecasting performance of the established model for tropical cyclone
   wave events was investigated in terms of both the spatial pattern and
   temporal variance of the SWH, MWP, and MWD. Extreme waves were generated
   using the proposed model and compared with the original hindcast
   results. The data-driven model showed promising potential for accurately
   capturing ambiguous patterns and features that are variant in both
   spatial and temporal dimensions, and exhibited obvious superiority over
   numerical wave modeling in terms of computational efficiency.},

Title = {A non-intrusive approach for efficient stochastic emulation and
   optimization of model-based nitrate-loading management decision support},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {126},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Use of physically-motivated numerical models like groundwater
   flow-and-transport models for probabilistic impact assessments and
   optimization under uncertainty (OUU) typically incurs such a
   computational burdensome that these tools cannot be used during decision
   making. The computational challenges associated with these models can be
   addressed through emulation. In the land-use/water-quality context, the
   linear relation between nitrate loading and surface-water/groundwater
   nitrate concentrations presents an opportunity for employing an
   efficient model emulator through the application of impulse-response
   matrices. When paired with first-order second-moment techniques, the
   emulation strategy gives rise to the ``stochastic impulse-response
   emulator{''} (SIRE). SIRE is shown to facilitate non-intrusive,
   near-real time, and risk-based evaluation of nitrate-loading change
   scenarios, as well as nitrate-loading OUU subject to
   surface-water/groundwater concentration constraints in high decision
   variable and parameter dimensions. Two case studies are used to
   demonstrate SIRE in the nitrate-loading context.},

Title = {Multi-Vehicle Interactive Lane-Changing Velocity Change Model Based on
   Potential Energy Field},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2676},
Number = {11},
Pages = {306-323},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To quantitatively analyze velocity change in the interaction of multiple
   vehicles during the lane-changing process, this study defines the
   concepts of driving constraint region and multi-vehicle interaction
   region (MVIR) by analyzing the potential energy field. The attraction
   and repulsion effects of the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles are
   attributed to the area change in the overlapping parts of their MVIRs. A
   multi-vehicle interactive lane-changing method considering MVIR is
   proposed. A velocity change model of multi-vehicle interactive
   lane-changing is established to reveal the change regularity of velocity
   under multi-vehicle interactive lane-changing. The model parameters are
   calibrated using a P3-DT Beidou high-precision positioning direction
   finding receiver to collect vehicle coordinates and velocity. The error
   of vehicle velocity variation was less than 11\%, which verified the
   validity of the velocity change model. The research results can guide
   drivers in completing the lane-changing process safely and quickly, and
   provide theoretical support for micro-traffic flow simulation, road
   traffic safety proactive prevention and control, multi-vehicle
   lane-changing rules, and multi-agent simulation platform construction.},

Title = {Male-Biased Partial Migration in a Giraffe Population},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Partial migration is a common movement phenomenon in ungulates, wherein
   part of the population remains resident while another portion of the
   population transitions to spatially or ecologically distinct seasonal
   ranges. Although widely documented, the causes of variation in movement
   strategies and their potential demographic consequences are not
   well-understood. Here, we used GPS telemetry data and individual-based
   photographic surveys to describe evidence for the partial migration of
   giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in the tropical savanna habitat of
   Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda. Seasonal movements in giraffe
   have been described but have not been systematically investigated within
   the framework of partial migration. We characterized movement behaviors
   of eight female GPS tracked giraffe across one full year using a
   model-driven approach of net-squared displacement metrics. To further
   evaluate these space use patterns at the population-level, we used
   closed robust design multi-state capture recapture models derived from
   individually based photographic surveys collected seasonally over three
   years. We also characterized environmental conditions associated with
   seasonal space use by conducting ground-based vegetation surveys and
   analyzing remotely sensed phenology data. Our results from both
   individually based telemetry models and population-level multi-state
   models suggest intra-population variation in seasonal space use
   strategies with three dominant movement classes: (1) Residents in
   deciduous savanna characterized by Acacia sieberiana, Acacia senegal,
   Harrisonia abyssinica, and Crateva adansonii in the far western end of
   the park. (2) Residents in the broadleaf savannas characterized by
   Pseudocedrela kotschyi, Stereospermum kunthianum, Termalia spp., and
   Combretum spp. in the central sector of the park (3) Male-biased
   migrants that transitioned seasonally between the acacia savanna in the
   wet seasons and the broadleaf savanna in the dry seasons. Our results
   offer insights into how giraffe navigate spatiotemporally dynamic
   environments at both individual and population levels, providing
   ecological mechanisms for the emergent population dynamics of these
   large-bodied topical browsers.},

Title = {Pattern identification of biomedical images with time series:
   Contrasting THz pulse imaging with DCE-MRIs},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective: We provide a survey of recent advances in biomedical image
   analysis and classification from emergent imaging modalities such as
   terahertz (THz) pulse imaging (TPI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced
   magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRIs) and identification of their
   underlining commonalities.
   Methods: Both time and frequency domain signal pre-processing techniques
   are considered: noise removal, spectral analysis, principal component
   analysis (PCA) and wavelet transforms. Feature extraction and
   classification methods based on feature vectors using the above
   processing techniques are reviewed. A tensorial signal processing
   de-noising framework suitable for spatiotemporal association between
   features in MRI is also discussed.
   Validation: Examples where the proposed methodologies have been
   successful in classifying TPIs and DCE-MRIs are discussed.
   Results: Identifying commonalities in the structure of such
   heterogeneous datasets potentially leads to a unified multi-channel
   signal processing framework for biomedical image analysis.
   Conclusion: The proposed complex valued classification methodology
   enables fusion of entire datasets from a sequence of spatial images
   taken at different time stamps; this is of interest from the viewpoint
   of inferring disease proliferation. The approach is also of interest for
   other emergent multi-channel biomedical imaging modalities and of
   relevance across the biomedical signal processing community. (C) 2016
