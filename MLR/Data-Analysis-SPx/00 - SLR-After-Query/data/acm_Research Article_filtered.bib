abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {The distribution network business includes power supply, power dispatch and control, electricity calculation and fee management, equipment maintenance and repair, power grid construction, new energy access, etc. There are certain differences between different business systems, leading to data barriers in business collaboration and difficulties in implementing collaborative solutions. In response to this issue, this article proposes the construction of a digital twin technology architecture for distribution network business collaboration, which integrates heterogeneous description data from various business systems in the distribution network into a unified digital twin model. Then define association and mapping rules between different data organization structures in the model, and use business knowledge to achieve coupling between data from various business systems. On the basis of data fusion, embed cross business application analysis algorithms in the digital twin model of the distribution network, extract the required cross system data from the data base of the model based on business logic, and carry out algorithm analysis and application. The technical architecture described in this article provides data base and analysis service support for new applications in distribution networks.},

abstract = {Cities and large urban areas face a myriad of challenges ranging from city planning, developing sustainable transportation, managing natural catastrophes, and mitigating communicable diseases. Addressing these challenges requires effective analysis and planning which in turn necessitates the use of sufficiently detailed models or "digital twins." Such detailed models that embody multifaceted demographic and city characteristics are challenging to generate. This paper presents our ongoing work to develop a novel model generation method and software suite called CITYSCAPE, that fuses diverse real-world data sets to generate a digital twin for a given city. Specifically, our method combines data from authoritative sources including PUMS, PUMAs, and OpenStreet Map to generate the digital twin. We have used the city of Chicago (IL, USA) as a case study to verify and validate (with ~85% confidence) our proposed method.},

abstract = {Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.},

abstract = {In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are new systems designed to support and synthesize sensing, communication, and computing components that interact with physical objects so that the system can sense, monitor, control, and respond to changes occurring in their operating environments. With developing Internet of Things (IoT), edge/cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), another new paradigm - Digital Twin (DT), as an enabler for realizing the Metaverse of CPS has emerged recently. The DT provides a virtual replica of the physical world, allowing for real-time monitoring, control, and analysis of safety-critical systems like the CPS. Even though many CPS-related problems can be addressed using DT concepts, it is critical to define DT’s integration clearly to leverage its features to the best possible extent. This paper introduces a new layer called the data layer in the CPS layer architecture to support different DT functionalities. Like the layer and abstract design paradigm of modern operation systems and computer networks, the data layer serves as an abstraction layer, providing immense flexibility and interchangeability of various data sources, supporting applications, and adapting to other components and environments. This also accelerates the growth of smart-world systems and their integration in different application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart cities, smart healthcare, etc.). To this end, this paper presents a new data layer structure to support CPS applications and the integration of multiple CPS. We propose a hierarchical architecture to synthesize DT techniques as an independent layer in our architecture, deeply integrated into existing CPS. We discuss key issues: leveraging the data layer to support applications in various CPS, incorporating the data layer and physical layer, and building a data layer using distributed computing, naming services, etc. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions based on the presented new data layer architecture for CPS.},

abstract = {In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.},

abstract = {Nowadays, vast amounts of data can be collected by sensors and used for data-driven approaches. Digital twins provide a framework to exploit these data for solving various issues. For many companies in the industrial sector, machine maintenance is a significant issue. Maintenance is essential for high overall equipment efficiency, but it can also be costly. Therefore, it should only be performed when necessary, based on the machine's condition. Condition monitoring is used to assess a machine's condition periodically, allowing for condition-based maintenance. In this paper, a simulation-based approach for parameter estimation is presented that contributes to condition-based maintenance. It introduces condition indicators for certain features of machines and demonstrates how to evaluate them using data farming, which employs simulation models as data generators. Additionally, the implementation of this approach in digital twins is discussed.},

By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.},

abstract = {Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.},

In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets. By developing and leveraging a three-dimensional Digital Twin (DT), we produce large scale datasets for validating social distancing in workspaces; and in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles, we evaluate how a CNN-based object detection model would perform in an Indian road scenario.},

abstract = {This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are finding increasing use, whether in factories, autonomous vehicles, or smart buildings. Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots.},

abstract = {A Digital Twin (DT) can be described as a pairing of a physical and virtual entity, in which the latter 'mimicks' the former in some sense, using data from its physical counterpart---whether real-time or historical---, for various purposes including better understanding of the physical entity's behaviour, predictive maintenance, and whatif scenario exploration. Here, we focus on the development of the virtual part of the DT in a context where the physical entity already exists, offering the potential for design and engineering artifacts from the physical entity to be reused. We performed a case study on the Turtle soccer robots developed by Eindhoven University of Technology's Tech United [6] team, to explore the possibilities of reusing artifacts for the development of the corresponding virtual entity. In this paper, we present our experiences from this case study and discuss the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges we faced.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the software they execute are often strongly coupled with vendors preinstalling their software at the factory. Future IoT applications are expected to be distributed via app stores. A strong coupling between hard- and software hinders the rise of such app stores. Existing model-driven approaches for developing IoT applications focus largely on the behavior specification and message exchange but generate code that targets a specific set of devices. By raising the level of abstraction, models can be utilized to decouple hard- and software and adapt to various infrastructures. We present a concept for a model-driven app store that decouples hardware and software development of product lines of IoT applications.},

abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) are one form of datafication. They are virtual reflections of physical world entities, of objects and phenomena, and are rapidly becoming an asset for innovation. There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.},

abstract = {In Korea, a strong earthquake of 5.8 and 5.4 magnitude occurred in Gyeongju in September 2016 and Pohang in November 2018 respectively. In the case of the Pohang Earthquake, the ground is losing its resistance and the ground liquefaction phenomenon that is behaving like a liquid is officially reported. In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.},

This requires that these enterprises need be efficient, adaptive and amenable for continuous transformation. However, identifying effective control measures, adaptation choices and transformation options for a specific enterprise goal is often both a challenging and expensive task for most of the complex enterprises. The construction of a high-fidelity digital-twin to evaluate the efficacy of a range of control measures, adaptation choices and transformation options is considered to be a cost effective approach for engineering disciplines. This paper presents a novel approach to analogously utilise the concept of digital twin in controlling and adapting large complex business enterprises, and demonstrates its efficacy using a set of adaptation scenarios of a large university.},

Usually, only one or two devices are given to the testers, but hundreds or thousands are needed to really test IoT effects. This proposition makes IoT Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) cost and management prohibitive. One possible approach is to develop a digital twin of the IoT device and employ many replicas of the twin in a simulation environment comprised of various simulators that mimic the IoT device's operational environment. Cyber attack experimentation is a critical aspect of IoT T&amp;E and without such a virtual T&amp;E environment, it is almost impossible to study large scale effects.

Moreover, it was found that security is not a top priority, but is often mentioned as a challenge. Besides the lack of standardization, the amount of academic papers published and industrial solutions offered is increasing, showing that the consensus is not a limiting factor and the concept is gaining popularity over the years and being applied in an increasing number of sectors, mainly on manufacturing, energy, aerospace and automotive.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent systems which integrate physical units and processes with computational entities over Internet and allow ubiquitous access of information and services. Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture - the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.},

abstract = {The demand for digital twins and suitable modeling techniques in the automotive industry is increasing rapidly. Yet, there is no common understanding of digital twins in automotive, nor are there modeling techniques established to create automotive digital twins. Recent studies on digital twins focus on the analysis of the literature on digital twins for automotive or in general and, thus, neglect the industrial perspective of automotive practitioners. To mitigate this gap between scientific literature and the industrial perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey among experts in the German automotive industry to identify i) the desired purposes for and capabilities of digital twins and ii) the modeling techniques related to engineering and operating digital twins across the phases of automotive development. To this end, we contacted 189 members of the Software-Defined Car research project and received 96 responses. The results show that digital twins are considered most useful in the usage and support phase of automotive development, representing vehicles as-operated. Moreover, simulation models, source code, and business process models are currently considered the most important models to be integrated into a digital twin alongside the associated, established tools.},

abstract = {Object design is a key task in the research and development of enterprise digital systems. In the past, object design was more based on the cognitive level of the designers, and the design results could not fully meet the requirements of "high cohesion and low coupling" design principle, which led to a large amount of modification work when the system faced with the change of requirements, and it was difficult to support the continuous development of the enterprise's digital business. This paper proposes an object design optimization method based on graph theory, which consists of four parts: firstly, the requirements and objects are expressed as requirement diagrams and object diagrams, so that the object design can be abstracted as a transformation from the requirement diagrams to the object diagrams; secondly, quantitative evaluation indexes of cohesion and coupling are given for the object model based on the graph theory to quantify the principle of "high cohesion, low coupling", so as to quantify the principle of "high cohesion, low coupling". Secondly, based on graph theory, the quantitative evaluation indexes of aggregation and coupling degree of object model are given to quantify the principle of "high cohesion and low coupling", so that quantitative comparison can be made between different design solutions to guide the design optimization work; thirdly, the object groups that conform to the characteristics of a specific graph theory can be found in the object relationship graph, and designers can decide whether or not to merge them in order to form the optimized object design; fourthly, based on the requirement graph and industry knowledge, the Digital twin can be constructed heuristically, which can significantly increase the degree of object The fourth is that digital twin objects can be constructed heuristically based on the demand graph and industry knowledge, which can significantly increase the degree of object aggregation and reduce the degree of coupling between objects. The paper illustrates the design algorithm process with a simplified electric power marketing system, and gives a comparison of the design results of the actual digital marketing system.},

abstract = {The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.},

This research explores the application of AI techniques like neural networks and genetic algorithms for multiphysics modeling, using an aerospace case example for educational purposes. A literature review examines existing physics-based and empirical modeling approaches in this domain. Subsequently, a multiphysics control model incorporating thermal, structural, and fluid dynamics interactions is developed. Neural networks can be trained on simulation data to learn these multiphysics relationships, with the potential to augment robotic assembly. Additionally, genetic algorithms optimize system designs by evolving populations of models based on performance objectives. This enables rapid virtual testing and discovery of optimal configurations.

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 is defined as connecting the physical system to the cyber world with the help of transformative technologies. As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion. From this, Digital Twin (DT), one of the main enabling technologies in Industry 4.0, has been identified to have the great potential in solving these challenges. DT sheds light on the real fusion of the cyber world and the physical world, and it has the potential to be used as a technology to help people build virtulized system with high-fidelity, hence greatly lower bar on the cybersecurity research of the cyber physical system and create other DT based cybersecurity applications.},

Those connections are essential to the complete system, as they enable external systems to react to changes in the internal model and vice versa. In our case, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability, a case study showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented. We show that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.

abstract = {The digital twin, as a digital counterpart of a physical entity, has shown great potential in data center prototyping and predictive thermal management. In this regard, Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) models have been widely adopted. However, the computing time of the CFD/HT simulation is prohibitively long in practice. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been explored to approximate the CFD/HT simulation by a linear combination of POD modes and coefficients. Existing approaches to calculating the POD coefficients use either the black-box interpolation or the simplified physical model, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability. To advance existing approaches, this paper proposes Reducio, a physics-guided model reduction approach based on the POD to predict the temperature field by following two key phases of i) offline POD modes calculation and coefficients interpolation and ii) online coefficients extrapolation supervised by the principle of energy balance. To extrapolate the coefficients with limited training data, we adopt the Gaussian Process (GP) model to learn a nonlinear map between the boundary conditions and POD coefficients. We conduct two case studies in two data centers with different scales. Evaluation results in the edge data center show that Reducio achieves sub-1°C mean absolute error (MAE) in temperature field prediction compared with the CFD/HT simulation result, outperforming the existing method based on the simplified physical model by 1.5 °C. When evaluating in the industry-grade hyper-scale data center with the sensor measurements, around 1°C temperature prediction MAE is observed. Furthermore, Reducio can predict the full-fledged temperature field in real-time, making it a strong candidate for building data center predictive digital twins.},

abstract = {Having a sustained human presence on the lunar surface is a central objective of the Artemis Program, as it represents a key pre-requisite in resource mining operations on the Moon as well as an important steppingstone for future Martian exploration and colonization. Despite its importance, this endeavor has little precedent to rely on to inform the many challenges it needs to address. Digital Twin, in recent years, has been employed in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we explore its usefulness in establishing the Artemis Base Camp. Digital twins can be applied to various stages of the lifecycle of the lunar base development. We also identify several open questions that need be addressed before the digital twin can be utilized effectively in this project. In fact, addressing these questions could facilitate deploying digital twins in use cases in a wider spectrum of industries and sectors.},

abstract = {A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.},

abstract = {Digital factories have been recognized as a paradigm with considerable promise for improving manufacturing performance. Digital Twins have emerged as a powerful tool to improve control performance for large-scale smart manufacturing systems. We argue that DT-based smart factories are vulnerable to attacks that use the DT to damage the system while remaining undetectable, specifically in high-cost processes, where DT technologies are more likely to be deployed. As an instructive example, we look into smart semiconductor processes with focus on photolithography. To this end, we formulate a static optimization problem to maximize the damage of a cyber-attack against a photolithography digital twin that minimizes detectability to the process controller. Results demonstrate that this problem formulation provides attack policies that successfully reduce the throughput of the system at trade off of increased detectability to a common process control technique. Results encourage more research in the domain, especially to face scalability and policy-like solutions.},

abstract = {In recent years, digital twins have been pervading different application domains—from manufacturing to healthcare—as an approach for virtualising different kinds of physical entities (things, products, machines). The dominant view developed in the literature so far is about the virtualisation of individual physical assets in a closed-system perspective. In this article, we introduce and explore a broader perspective that we call Web of Digital Twins (WoDT), in which the digital twin paradigm is exploited for the pervasive softwarisation of possibly large-scale interrelated physical realities. A WoDT can be conceived as an open, distributed and dynamic ecosystem of connected digital twins, functioning as an interoperable service-oriented layer for applications running on top, especially smart applications and multiagent systems. The article introduces an abstract model and architecture aimed to capture key aspects of the idea not bound to any specific application domains or implementing technologies and discusses their adoption in engineering real-world systems. To this purpose, two concrete case studies are considered, in the context of healthcare and smart mobility. Finally, the article includes a discussion of a selected set of research directions.},

abstract = {Runtime monitoring is essential for ensuring the safe operation and enabling self-adaptive behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). It requires the creation of system monitors, instrumentation for data collection, and the definition of constraints. All of these aspects need to evolve to accommodate changes in the system. However, most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors and constraints for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for evolving the monitoring infrastructure. Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS. In this "new and emerging results" paper we propose a novel framework for model-integrated runtime monitoring. We combine model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate large parts of the monitoring framework and to reduce the maintenance effort necessary when parts of the monitored system change. We build a prototype and evaluate our approach against a system for controlling the flights of unmanned aerial vehicles.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.},

Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts.

Existing service robots, while operational, often struggle with adaptability and dynamic task management, leading to inefficiencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CrowdBot, a robot management system that enhances service in campus environments. Our system leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning-based cloud-edge hybrid scheduling framework (REDIS), for efficient online streaming task assignment and dynamic action scheduling. To verify the REDIS framework, we have developed a digital twin simulation platform, which integrates large language models and hot-swapping technology. This facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, efficient task allocation, and cost-effective execution through the reuse of robot equipment. Our comprehensive simulations corroborate the system's remarkable efficacy, demonstrating significant improvements with a 24.46% reduction in task completion times, a 9.37% decrease in travel distances, and up to a 3% savings in power usage. Additionally, the system achieves a 7.95% increase in the number of tasks completed and a 9.49% reduction in response time. Real-world case studies further affirm CrowdBot's capability to adeptly execute tasks and judiciously recycle resources, thereby offering a smart and viable solution for the streamlined management of campus services.},

abstract = {In the context of smart healthcare, the integration of multimedia and digital twin technologies has driven significant advances in telemedicine. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as a part of multimedia healthcare data, provide crucial digital information about the electrical activity of the heart, which is essential for diagnosing arrhythmias and ensuring a healthy life. Arrhythmia classification is a fundamental step in analyzing ECG signals and a critical problem for diagnosing heart diseases. One key challenge in arrhythmia classification is the lack of high accuracy for classifying arrhythmia heartbeats, and another key challenge is the lack of interpretability of decision-making models. This study aims to develop a novel approach to improve the performance of arrhythmia classification while providing explainable diagnostic decision paths. We propose XDTEncoder, an explainable arrhythmia classification framework that leverages multi-level features to classify arrhythmia heartbeats while offering an explainable diagnostic decision path. XDTEncoder is novel in three aspects. (1) It constructs a human-machine collaborative knowledge representation based on the Encoder-Decoder paradigm, which allows our model to classify arrhythmias while producing decision paths for cardiologists. (2) XDTEncoder compares two encoding methods (the binary tree encoding method and the Huffman encoding method) to embed the diagnostic decision tree into the arrhythmia classification framework. (3) XDTEncoder fuses multi-level features to improve the performance of arrhythmias classification. Evaluation on 5 types of arrhythmias in the MIT-BIH database demonstrates that our new approach outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers while providing interpretability.},

abstract = {The purpose of systems engineering is to, often collaboratively and following complex workflows, analyse, design, optimize, operate, and evolve complex, cyber-physical systems. This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of "experiments" which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the "5D model".},

abstract = {For large, complex simulation models, simulation metamodeling is crucial for enabling simulation-based-optimization under uncertainty in operational settings where results are needed quickly. We enhance simulation metamodeling in two important ways. First, we use graph neural networks (GrNN) to allow the graphical structure of a simulation model to be treated as a metamodel input parameter that can be varied along with real-valued and integer-ordered inputs. Second, we combine GrNNs with generative neural networks so that a metamodel can rapidly produce not only a summary statistic like E[Y], but also a sequence of i.i.d. samples of Y or even a stochastic process that mimics dynamic simulation outputs. Thus a single metamodel can be used to estimate multiple statistics for multiple performance measures. Our metamodels can potentially serve as surrogate models in digital-twin settings. Preliminary experiments indicate the promise of our approach.},

abstract = {Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition.In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives.Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below £10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above £81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was £240/tCO2.},

abstract = {The emerging integration of IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) has unlocked numerous opportunities for innovation across diverse industries. However, growing privacy concerns and data isolation issues have inhibited this promising advancement. Unfortunately, traditional centralized machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated their limitations in addressing these hurdles. In response to this ever-evolving landscape, Federated Learning (FL) has surfaced as a cutting-edge machine learning paradigm, enabling collaborative training across decentralized devices. FL allows users to jointly construct AI models without sharing their local raw data, ensuring data privacy, network scalability, and minimal data transfer. One essential aspect of FL revolves around proficient knowledge aggregation within a heterogeneous environment. Yet, the inherent characteristics of FL have amplified the complexity of its practical implementation compared to centralized ML. This survey delves into three prominent clusters of FL research contributions: personalization, optimization, and robustness. The objective is to provide a well-structured and fine-grained classification scheme related to these research areas through a unique methodology for selecting related work. Unlike other survey papers, we employed a hybrid approach that amalgamates bibliometric analysis and systematic scrutinizing to find the most influential work in the literature. Therefore, we examine challenges and contemporary techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy. Another valuable asset of this study is its comprehensive coverage of FL aggregation strategies, encompassing architectural features, synchronization methods, and several federation motivations. To further enrich our investigation, we provide practical insights into evaluating novel FL proposals and conduct experiments to assess and compare aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we present a compelling set of research avenues that call for further exploration to open up a treasure of advancement.},

The results of the user study indicate that users largely prefer the hybrid editor and are more confident with hybrid notations for understanding the meaning of conditions.

abstract = {Hospitals are considered as highly complex critical infrastructure buildings due to their size and significant usage. Therefore, a high level of communication and coordination of all stakeholders and tasks is required for successful hospital management, starting with the planning of the building and especially for the utilization phase. This paper presents the opportunities and challenges of the digital method Building Information Modelling (BIM) in hospital construction for the building management to improve the health care service management. The relevant background information regarding BIM in general, hospital projects in which BIM has been applied, etc. was obtained by literature research.Based on background information obtained by literature research about BIM and the application in hospitals, guided interviews were conducted to determine the opportunities and challenges of BIM in hospital construction. In this process experts from the healthcare sector were interviewed who had already gained experience with the BIM application in single pilot projects. The evaluation of the interviews was carried out with qualitative content analysis according to Mayring.Although BIM is applied as a digital method in construction industry, the benefits go beyond the construction perspective. A BIM model provides the necessary infrastructure to advance the digitalization of hospital services. The digital twin of the building can be considered as basis therefore. Besides the opportunities for the hospital building, there are presented possibilities in the utilization for health care service based on the BIM model, e.g. automated disinfection of door handles in the building. However, there are also challenges for the implementation and application of BIM, as for example the model needs to be constantly maintained by qualified personnel in order to ensure reliability.},

abstract = {Developers have long recognized the importance of the concepts underlying the systems they build, and the primary role that concepts play in shaping user experience. To date, however, concepts have tended to be only implicit in software design with development being organized instead around more concrete artifacts (such as wireframes and code modules).  

Palantir, a software company whose data analytics products are widely used by major corporations, recently reworked the internal representation of its software development process to bring concepts to the fore, making explicit the concepts underlying its products, including how they are clustered together, used in applications, and governed by teams. With a centralized repository of concepts, Palantir engineers are able to align products more closely based on shared concepts, evolve concepts in response to user needs, and communicate more effectively with non-engineering groups within the company.  

This paper reports on Palantir's experiences to date, analyzing both successes and challenges, and offers advice to other organizations considering adopting a concept-centric approach to software development.},

abstract = {In the construction domain, Digital twins are mostly used for facilities management of buildings, but their applications are still very limited. The virtualization of buildings and bridges in the last 15 years in the form of Building or Bridge Information Models is clearly identified as the starting point for the DTs. The industry has erected a frame with semantically rich 3D reference models that are now heavily enriched with visual sensor data captured on construction sites. This article provides an overview of the research and current practices of computer vision methods in the construction industry and presents typical examples of their applications for 3D reconstruction, safety management and structural monitoring for quality assurance. It then highlights the dominant achievements presented in the literature and concludes with the challenges and research directions applicable to digital twins that need to be addressed and exploited in the future.},

abstract = {Microgrids are localized power systems that can function independently or alongside the main grid. They consist of interconnected generators, energy storage, and loads that can be managed locally. Using SystemC-AMS, we demonstrate how microgrid components, including solar panels and converters, can be accurately modeled and simulated, along with their interactions. Real-time simulations are crucial for understanding microgrid behavior and optimizing components. This approach facilitates seamless integration with hardware prototypes and automation systems, supporting various development stages. Our study presents a best-case scenario for real-time simulation, assuming each loop takes less time than the simulation time step, with fallback to the previous value if data isn't received in time. This article introduces the first known real-time simulation strategy using SystemC-AMS, enabling the real-time simulation of microgrid components and integration with external devices. The implementation adopts a model-based design approach, creating increasingly complex systems with grid components and controllers.},

abstract = {A key challenge for manufacturers today is efficiently producing and delivering products on time. Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a "digital twin" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.},

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

abstract = {Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a simulation technique that captures model interactions in dynamic real-world application environments. ABMs may incur significant simulation times for large-scale business applications in the real world. A primary challenge is to reduce the simulation time while ensuring the functional correctness of the simulated application on the underlying hardware.This paper illustrates how a correct functional architecture of an application can significantly improve the application's simulation performance in terms of scalability and simulation time. We propose a metamodel to capture the communication patterns among various agents of an application deployed over ABM. This knowledge on learning communication patterns is used to design an optimally distributed software architecture for the application to minimize the number of messages communicated among agents. Further, we propose a performance model-based deployment of the architected application on the underlying hardware. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a use case from the telecom domain. We validate our results via detailed empirical analysis achieving a 517\texttimes{} gain for 1 million users in simulation time. We also scale to 50M users in barely 3.7 hours. The insights obtained from our experiments can serve as guidelines for system engineers, facilitating the process of scaling applications simulated using ABM simulators.},

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice.

To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.},

abstract = {Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts’ searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Production scheduling is the task of assigning job operations to processing resources such that a target goal is optimized. constraints on job structure and resource capabilities, including stochastic influences, e.g. job arrivals, define individual problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) solvers are adaptive and potentially robust in highly stochastic settings. However, benchmarking RL solutions for stochastic problems is challenging, requiring the simulation of complex production settings while guaranteeing reproducible stochasticity. No such simulation is currently available. To cover this gap, we introduce FabricatioRL, an RL compatible, customizable and extensible benchmarking simulation framework. Our contribution is twofold: We first derive requirements to ensure that generic production setups can be covered, the simulation framework can interface with both traditional approaches and RL, and experiments are reproducible. Then, we detail the FabricatioRL design and implementation satisfying the obtained requirements in terms of framework input, core simulation process, and the interface with different scheduling systems.},

abstract = {Extreme weather events and fast-paced adoption of green energy technologies have led to new challenges in demand-side management, maintaining grid reliability, and fulfilling variable consumer demands One of the effective ways to address these difficulties is by introducing economic incentives - replacing the flat rate tariffs with dynamic tariffs. However, dynamic pricing schemes need to be designed carefully to consider fairness and benefits for consumers as well as power companies. This paper describes an ML-based simulation framework for exploring two fairness constructs of dynamic pricing for residential electricity with behavioral agent-based models based on social theory combined with active learning. As an example, we simulate behavior adaptations in response to changes in electricity prices to study cost savings through monthly bills and peak demand reduction in synthetic household agents in a Time Of Use (TOU) pricing scheme in Virginia, USA. Further, we can show that there exists a region in the parameter space that corresponds to a fair TOU pricing scheme for both entities: all income-stratified communities and power companies.},

However, most studies on the HHCRSP are based on deterministic models that do not consider any disruptions that may compromise the execution of the schedules. In this paper, we analyze the impact of different sources of disturbances on a deterministic schedule : delays at the start of the route, variability of travel time, and variability of service processing time. Simulation has been chosen because it helps to easily model and analyze complex environments with several sources of variability. Graphical representations and an analysis of variance are presented to interpret the results, leading to several managerial insights and openings for future research.},

However, for all these cases, data is the key ingredient and enabler for the vision and realization of smart cities. This article explores the challenges associated with smart city data. We start with gaining an understanding of the concept of a smart city, how to measure that the city is a smart one, and what architectures and platforms exist to develop one. Afterwards, we research the challenges associated with the data of the cities, including availability, heterogeneity, management, analysis, privacy, and security. Finally, we discuss ethical issues.

abstract = {The upcoming decentralized production systems seem to be promising in Industry 4.0 assembly to handle the challenges of highly individual products. Matrix production characterized by freely linked workstations and an advanced automation level are highly flexible. That is why many efforts have already been made to explore the advantages compared to existing flow shop production systems, but also the additional challenges arising from this new paradigm. One of these challenges is the synchronization of main product and supply part flow at the individual workstations during order scheduling. This paper presents a new approach of integrating logistics support processes into the scheduling of the main product flow to consider the part supply in the decisions taken during scheduling avoiding waiting times. We compare our integrated approach with the existing decoupled scheduling approach, based on a "bicycle assembly" scenario. The results are promising particularly when part supply is a bottleneck.},

abstract = {Metaverse is expected to emerge as a new paradigm for the next-generation Internet, providing fully immersive and personalized experiences to socialize, work, and play in self-sustaining and hyper-spatio-temporal virtual world(s). The advancements in different technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G/6G communication will be the key enablers behind the realization of AI-XR metaverse applications. While AI itself has many potential applications in the aforementioned technologies (e.g., avatar generation, network optimization), ensuring the security of AI in critical applications like AI-XR metaverse applications is profoundly crucial to avoid undesirable actions that could undermine users’ privacy and safety, consequently putting their lives in danger. To this end, we attempt to analyze the security, privacy, and trustworthiness aspects associated with the use of various AI techniques in AI-XR metaverse applications. Specifically, we discuss numerous such challenges and present a taxonomy of potential solutions that could be leveraged to develop secure, private, robust, and trustworthy AI-XR applications. To highlight the real implications of AI-associated adversarial threats, we designed a metaverse-specific case study and analyzed it through the adversarial lens. Finally, we elaborate upon various open issues that require further research interest from the community.},

abstract = {Latest governmental policies aim to mitigate the carbon impact on climate and accelerate the transition towards carbon neutrality by imposing stronger regulations for companies. The semiconductor industry emits carbon dioxide caused by its large amounts of consumed energy. At the same time, machine sensors tracking consumption are rare, and the share of fixed and variable energy consumption is often unknown. To detect the individual energy consumption types of a wafer fab, a process- and infrastructure-oriented discrete-event simulation model is developed that serves as a tool to determine the plant energy consumption within a fab. The obtained shares are validated with existing data. In parallel, a novel enery efficiency curve is constructed and verified by extending the concept of the well-studied Operating Curve. It incorporates the relationship between utilization and energy efficiency and adds an ecological viewpoint to the so far only economically motivated concept.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel modeling framework for semiconductor fabrication facilities (FABs) that integrates production and material handling systems. Because the productivity of semiconductor FABs is significantly influenced by their material-handling systems, existing research has focused on optimizing operational logic considering both aspects. However, the scale and complexity of modern FABs make implementation of fully integrated models challenging, resulting in slow simulation speeds for long periods. To address this issue, we propose a multi-resolution modeling framework that creates material-handling system models at two distinct resolution levels, enabling fast, fully integrated FAB models while accounting for material-handling effects. Experimental results demonstrated accelerated simulation completion compared to single-resolution models while maintaining consistent results. The proposed method provides a practical approach for semiconductor FABs to investigate long-term phenomena and urgent decision-making problems while considering both production and material-handling systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a simulation model for an Assembly-To-Order (ATO) system. The model can be used to identify potential conflicts or bottlenecks in the system, to assist in the decisionmaking process, and to improve on the existing manual orders planning process. The process flow in the ATO system is complex as the system needs to handle a variety of products, different process routings, high product mix, and shared resources. The simulation model is developed using an existing commercial software platform. The model is designed to be fully data-driven, with sets of input and output data schema tables. This approach will make the simulation modeling more accessible to manufacturing community, and enable integration to factory's Manufacturing Execution System (MES) for real-time data and Real Time Dashboard (RTD) for displaying multiple scenarios of simulation results. The integration is accomplished through a central database server via Application Programming Interface (API).},

We drew inspiration from manual qualitative research methods for mining patterns and architectural knowledge and created a guideline model of which the ADD models are instances. We evaluated our approach on 11 cases from the gray literature. We found that it can provide suitable recommendations after modeling only a single case and reaches theoretical saturation and recommendations with low to very low errors after only 6-8 cases. Our approach shows that creating a reusable architectural design space is possible based only on limited case data. Our approach not only provides a novel approach to architectural knowledge management but can also be used as a tool for pattern mining.},

In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study to assess the state of the art and practice of robotics software engineering. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with industrial practitioners working in 15 companies from 9 different countries and a survey with 156 respondents from 26 countries from the robotics domain. Our results provide a comprehensive picture of (i) the practices applied by robotics industrial and academic practitioners, including processes, paradigms, languages, tools, frameworks, and reuse practices, (ii) the distinguishing characteristics of robotics software engineering, and (iii) recurrent challenges usually faced, together with adopted solutions.

Now, companies must mass produce to keep costs low, but they must also be flexible and offer a wide variety of products. Thus, companies are increasingly using computational tools to improve decision making, especially with the application of simulation and digitization of production systems. However, online data collection is presenting itself as a solution to decrease the time for the development of simulation models and, thus, speed up decision making. In this way, this work shows the steps required for online data exchange between a real system and a virtual production system. For this, a prototype will be used that demonstrates these basic concepts.},

abstract = {Objective: it aims to adopt deep transfer learning combined with Digital Twins (DTs) in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) medical image enhancement. Methods: MRI image enhancement method based on metamaterial composite technology is proposed by analyzing the application status of DTs in medical direction and the principle of MRI imaging. On the basis of deep transfer learning, MRI super-resolution deep neural network structure is established. To address the problem that different medical imaging methods have advantages and disadvantages, a multi-mode medical image fusion algorithm based on adaptive decomposition is proposed and verified by experiments. Results: the optimal Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 34.11dB can be obtained by introducing modified linear element and loss function of deep transfer learning neural network structure. The Structural Similarity Coefficient (SSIM) is 85.24%. It indicates that the MRI truthfulness and sharpness obtained by adding composite metasurface are improved greatly. The proposed medical image fusion algorithm has the highest overall score in the subjective evaluation of the six groups of fusion image results. Group III had the highest score in Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Positron Emission Computed Tomography (MRI-PET) image fusion, with a score of 4.67, close to the full score of 5. As for the objective evaluation in group I of Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (MRI-SPECT) images, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) are the highest, which are 39.2075, 116.688, and 0.594, respectively. Mutual Information (MI) is 5.8822. Conclusion: the proposed algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in preserving spatial details of MRI images and color information direction of SPECT images, and the other five groups have achieved similar results.},

Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

abstract = {The Ubiquitous Operating System(UOS) is a new type of operating system in response to the new patterns and scenarios of future human-cyber-physical ternary ubiquitous computing. Compared with traditional operating systems, one of the fundamental requirements of UOS is to adaptively manage numerous heterogeneous sensors according to dynamic environments and diverse tasks. However, traditional management focuses on the sensors’ parameters and interfaces without highlighting the perception effect that is users’ concern and dynamic changing. It also lacks a unified management approach for heterogeneous sensors. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensors dynamic management model UbiCap, i.e., Ubiquitous Capability, which is based on the capability abstraction and adaptive run-time capability management mechanism. The capability provides a unified abstract for heterogeneous sensors. The adaptive run-time capability management mechanism transfers the management object from low-level hardware sensors to high-level sensing capability. The capability required and the available capability are matched to support run-time adaptive sensors selection. We implement a software prototype iS2ROS(intelligent Sensor Selection Robot Operating System) based on the UbiCap model. We then simulate a forest fire spot monitoring scenario where iS2ROS selects the optimal image sensor during the identification task execution while light or weather condition changes. Experiment results show that the iS2ROS achieves comparative sensing effectiveness through UbiCap with 50% power consumption lower compared to the traditional both-sensors approach.},

abstract = {Simulation has become, in many application areas, a sine qua non. Most recently, COVID-19 has underlined the importance of simulation studies and limitations in current practices and methods. We identify four goals of methodological work for addressing these limitations. The first is to provide better support for capturing, representing, and evaluating the context of simulation studies, including research questions, assumptions, requirements, and activities contributing to a simulation study. In addition, the composition of simulation models and other simulation studies’ products must be supported beyond syntactical coherence, including aspects of semantics and purpose, enabling their effective reuse. A higher degree of automating simulation studies will contribute to more systematic, standardized simulation studies and their efficiency. Finally, it is essential to invest increased effort into effectively communicating results and the processes involved in simulation studies to enable their use in research and decision making. These goals are not pursued independently of each other, but they will benefit from and sometimes even rely on advances in other sub-fields. In this article, we explore the basis and interdependencies evident in current research and practice and delineate future research directions based on these considerations.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving sequential decision-making problems in domains like robotics, autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, supply chain, and health care. For such applications, uncertainty in real-life environments presents a significant challenge in training an RL agent. RL requires a large number of trials (training examples) to learn a good policy. One of the approaches to tackle these obstacles is augmenting RL with a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model. Learning from a simulated environment, makes the training process of the RL agent more efficient, faster, and even safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world trials. Therefore, integrating RL algorithms with simulation environments has inspired many researchers in recent years. In this paper, we analyze the existing literature on RL models using DES to put forward the benefits, application areas, challenges, and scope for future work in developing such models for industrial use cases.},

abstract = {A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.},

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.},

abstract = {Aerial drones are increasingly being considered as a valuable tool for inspection in safety critical contexts. Nowhere is this more true than in mining operations which present a dynamic and dangerous environment for human operators. Drones can be deployed in a number of contexts including efficient surveying as well as search and rescue missions. Operating in these dynamic contexts is challenging however and requires the drones control software to detect and adapt to conditions at run-time.To help in the development of such systems we present Aloft, a simulation supported testbed for investigating self-adaptive controllers for drones in mines. Aloft utilises the Robot Operating system (ROS) and a model environment using Gazebo to provide a physics-based testing. The simulation environment is constructed from a 3D point cloud collected in a physical mock-up of a mine and contains features expected to be found in real-world contexts.Aloft allows members of the research community to deploy their own self-adaptive controllers into the control loop of the drone to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of controllers in a challenging environment. To demonstrate our system we provide a self-adaptive drone controller and operating scenario as an exemplar. The self-adaptive drone controller provided utilises a two-layered architecture with a MAPE-K feedback loop. The scenario is an inspection task during which we inject a communications failure. The aim of the controller is to detect this loss of communication and autonomously perform a return home behaviour. Limited battery life presents a constraint on the mission, which therefore means that the drone should complete its mission as fast as possible. Humans, however, might also be present within the environment. This poses a safety risk and the drone must be able to avoid collisions during autonomous flight.In this paper we describe the controller framework and the simulation environment and provide information on how a user might construct and evaluate their own controllers in the presence of disruptions at run-time.},

abstract = {The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.},

abstract = {The synthetic control method has pioneered a class of powerful data-driven techniques to estimate the counterfactual reality of a unit from donor units. At its core, the technique involves a linear model fitted on the pre-intervention period that combines donor outcomes to yield the counterfactual. However, linearly combining spatial information at each time instance using time-agnostic weights fails to capture important inter-unit and intra-unit temporal contexts and complex nonlinear dynamics of real data. We instead propose an approach to use local spatiotemporal information before the onset of the intervention as a promising way to estimate the counterfactual sequence. To this end, we suggest a Transformer model that leverages particular positional embeddings, a modified decoder attention mask, and a novel pre-training task to perform spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence modeling. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the efficacy of our method in the typical small donor pool setting and its robustness against noise. We also generate actionable healthcare insights at the population and patient levels by simulating a state-wide public health policy to evaluate its effectiveness, an in silico trial for asthma medications to support randomized controlled trials, and a medical intervention for patients with Friedreich’s ataxia to improve clinical decision making and promote personalized therapy (code is available at ).},

This approach is a classical physics-based method in which a model represents casual relationships.

Combined model and data, one benefits from the advantages of both methods, generalization capabilities and better accuracy. This paper discusses ways in which the two methods have been used together and proposes a generic framework showing how they can be applied to various phases of combat effectiveness simulation modeling process.

The solution of the data-driven model is based on the gradient descent method, which provides an error bound on the optimal solution and a sub-linear convergence rate. We also rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of the global optimum to the proposed data-driven IO problem and analyze its robustness in two possible noisy settings.

abstract = {In order to address the issue of blind spots in traditional bridge inspections, achieve comprehensive coverage of bridge inspections, and enhance the safety and effectiveness of bridge health assessments, this paper proposes an intelligent detection method for bridge surface defects based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as carriers and artificial intelligence as the core. This method initially combines GPS positioning information with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless communication technology positioning information through smoothing processing, enabling seamless switching between the two positioning methods. Subsequently, a UAV equipped with a telephoto camera is employed for autonomous omnidirectional flight and data collection over the bridge. Finally, the collected data is processed using the StyleGAN2 (Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network) model to generate a larger quantity of finely distributed images of small cracks, which are then recognized in real time using the YOLOv3 neural network algorithm. The proposed method is tested on the Longtanhe Extra-Large Bridge segment of the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway mainline in Hubei, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves accurate UAV positioning in situations where GPS signals are obstructed, but also effectively identifies small cracks on the bridge surface in complex backgrounds, with a crack recall rate of 90% and an improved crack recognition rate of 95%. The methodology presented in this paper provides a scientific and precise basis for the safe operation and maintenance of bridges, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional bridge inspection methods. It offers a new direction for the development of intelligent bridge inspection techniques, bridging the gap between conventional methods and intelligent approaches.},

abstract = {Autopilot systems are typically composed of an “inner loop” providing stability and control, whereas an “outer loop” is responsible for mission-level objectives, such as way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are predominately implemented using Proportional-Integral-Derivative&nbsp;(PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However, more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning&nbsp;(RL), which has had success in other applications, such as robotics. Yet previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with state-of-the-art RL algorithms—Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Proximal Policy Optimization. To investigate these unknowns, we first developed an open source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then used our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control.},

Due to the rapid progress in hardware as well as software technology, the range of applications of CPS is ever increasing. Despite the potential of simulation technology, there are several distinct challenges arising when simulating CPS, which mostly stem from their heterogeneity. In this paper, we present an approach to modeling and simulation of CPS that embraces this heterogeneity by integrating component models realized in domain-specific simulation tools in a co-simulation framework using a flexible plugin system. The framework includes an active simulation database that is used for modeling and communication, and a DE scheduler to orchestrate the co-simulation scenario. The approach is applied to a modular spacecraft where computational hardware is emulated and computer networks are simulated. This results in a comprehensive simulation of both physical and information processing systems.},

In contrast to long design processes, low product variability (one-fits-all), and highly rigid systems, modern pharma players are answering the question: can we bring design and process control up to the speed that novel production technologies give us to quickly set up a flexible production run?

abstract = {Design-time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed. However, experts’ assumptions made at design-time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT). Therefore, experts’ design-time decisions can be challenged at run-time. A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses and intertwines design-time and run-time decisions is thus necessary. This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation. The approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture. This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture. We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions. A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach. We also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.},

abstract = {Automated monitoring of deployed Cyber-physical Systems while they are operating can assist in detecting misbehavior. One way to achieve such monitoring is via co-simulation of a modelled system that corresponds to the deployed system. A necessary element in the realization of such a concept is data brokering between the systems. Our work addresses the topic of brokering external data into an Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) 2.0 enabled co-simulation via a Functional Mock-up Unit (a simulation unit) called RabbitMQ FMU that outputs messages from an external message queue into the FMI enabled co-simulation.Our contribution includes a formal specification that captures the semantics of RabbitMQ FMU and ensures a maximum delay on the messages relayed to the co-simulation even through an unreliable network. This formal specification is then used to generate test cases that exercise all states and transitions of the formal specification. The implementation is then subjected to these test cases to verify that it is a refinement of the specification. The verification procedure is ongoing and currently the implementation has successfully been subjected to 1,539,246 tests. The RabbitMQ FMU provides a general and self-contained solution to brokering external data into and FMI-enabled co-simulation with guaranteed delays.},

abstract = {Dimensional measurement is critical for quality control. Manual dimensional measurement using standard gauges can only be applied on a few datums. To measure a huge number of datums, a component needs to be scanned into a point cloud and measured digitally. For precision components, datum generation on the scanned point cloud is labor-intensive. Given a raw point cloud from scanner, this paper proposes an automatic dimensional measurement solution with an adaptive local registration algorithm and an adaptive datum generation algorithm. Using datums on the CAD model as reference, the adaptive local registration algorithm selects local regions on the scanned model to compensate the local deviation between the CAD model and the scanned model. After that, with outliers and noises in the raw data, the adaptive datum generation algorithm creates the correct datums on the scanned model adaptive to the actual geometry. Dimensional measurement based on the generated datums can be achieved automatically. Moreover, the solution does not require users to manually preprocess the point cloud, such as outlier and noise removal. As such, it improves the productivity in dimensional inspection.},

abstract = {To mitigate the long-term spectrum crunch problem, the FCC recently opened up the 6 GHz frequency band for unlicensed use. However, the existing spectrum sharing strategies cannot support the operation of access points in moving vehicles such as cars and UAVs. This is primarily because of the directionality-based spectrum sharing among the incumbent systems in this band and the high mobility of the moving vehicles, which together make it challenging to control the cross-system interference. In this paper, we propose SwarmShare, a mobility-resilient spectrum sharing framework for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band. We first present a mathematical formulation of the SwarmShare problem, where the objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of the UAV network by jointly controlling the flight and transmission power of the UAVs and their association with the ground users, under the interference constraints of the incumbent system. We find that there are no closed-form mathematical models that can be used to characterize the statistical behaviors of the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system. Then we propose a data-driven three-phase spectrum sharing approach, including Initial Power Enforcement, Offline-dataset Guided Online Power Adaptation, and Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Optimization. We validate the effectiveness of SwarmShare through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that, based on SwarmShare, the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system can be effectively kept below the target level without requiring the real-time cross-system channel state information. The mobility resilience of SwarmShare is also validated in coexisting networks with no precise UAV location information.},

abstract = {Emotional labor refers to the process in which workers are required to express emotions regardless of their actual feelings by the organization. In workplaces where such display rules exist, workers experience an emotional workload. Continued exposure to emotional workload can lead to severe mental and psychological issues. Nevertheless, research on assessing emotional workload remains understudied. In this study, we propose a machine learning model to automatically evaluate workers' emotional workload in emotional labor situations through multimodal sensing. The data collection study was designed based on a call center scenario. Within the study, we manipulated customer behaviors as confederates and assessed the worker's emotional workload. As a result, this study provides a benchmark using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. We achieved an accuracy of up to 87% for binary and three-class classification cases. Finally, we discuss the significance of assessing emotional workload and considerations for its practical application in the workplace.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Smart city technologies promise reduced congestion by optimizing transportation movements. Increased connectivity, however, may increase the attack surface of a municipality's critical functions. Increased supply chain attacks (up nearly 80 % in 2019) and municipal ransomware attacks (up 60 % in 2019) motivate the need for holistic approaches to risk assessment. Therefore, we present a methodology to quantify the degree to which supply-chain movements may be observed or disrupted via compromised smart-city devices. Our data-processing pipeline uses publicly available datasets to model intermodal commodity flows within and surrounding a municipality. Using a hierarchy tree to adaptively sample spatial networks within geographic regions of interest, we bridge the gap between grid- and network-based risk assessment frameworks. Results based on fieldwork for the Jack Voltaic exercises sponsored by the Army Cyber Institute demonstrate our approach on intermodal movements through Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives, forcing us to reconsider our built environment, architectural designs, and even behaviours. Multiple stakeholders, including designers, building facility managers, and policy makers, are making decisions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and make our environment safer; however, systems to effectively and interactively evaluate virus transmission in physical spaces are lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose OccSim, a system that automatically generates occupancy behaviours in a 3D model of a building and helps users analyze the potential effect of virus transmission from a large-scale and longitudinal perspective. Our participatory evaluation with four groups of stakeholders revealed that OccSim could enhance their decision making processes by identifying specific risks of virus transmission in advance, and illuminating how each risk relates to complex human-building interactions. We reflect on our design and discuss OccSim’s potential implications in the domains of ‘design evaluation,’ ‘generative design,’ and ‘digital twins.’},

abstract = {Principles of modern cyber-physical system (CPS) analysis are based on analytical methods that depend on whether safety or liveness requirements are considered. Complexity is abstracted through different techniques, ranging from stochastic modelling to contracts. However, both distributed heuristics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches as well as the user perspective or unpredictable effects, such as accidents or the weather, introduce enough uncertainty to warrant reinforcement-learning-based approaches. This paper compares traditional approaches in the domain of CPS modelling and analysis with the AI researcher perspective to exploring unknown complex systems.},

abstract = {Digital Twins of industrial process plants enable various what-if and if-what scenarios of the plants' functioning for fault diagnosis and general monitoring in the real-world. They do so through machine learning (ML) models built using data from sensors fitted in the plant. Over time, environmental factors cause variations in sensor readings, adversely affecting quality of the models' predictions. This triggers the self-learning loop, leading to the re-tuning/re-training of models. Reducing the time spent in self-learning of the models is a challenging task since there exist multiple models that need to be trained repeatedly using multiple algorithms which translates into large training time.We propose a metalearner which recommends the optimal regression algorithm for a model, thereby eliminating the need for training the model on multiple algorithms for every self-learning instance. The metalearner is trained on metafeatures extracted from the data which makes it application agnostic. We introduce domain metafeatures, which enhance metalearner prediction accuracy and propose machine learning and deep learning based approaches for selecting optimal metafeatures. To ensure relevance of selected metafeatures, we introduce novel static and dynamic reward functions for dynamic metafeature selection using a Q-Learning based approach. Our metalearning approach accelerates the time for determining the optimal regressor among 5 potential regressors from 5X to 27X over the traditional self-learning approaches. The incremental pre-processing approach achieves a speed-up of 25X over the traditional approach. The proposed metalearner achieves an AUC of 0.989, 0.954 and 0.998 for ML, DL and RL based approaches for metafeature selection respectively. We illustrate our findings on 3 datasets from the industrial process domain.},

abstract = {The growing global competition for implementation of the "Industry 4.0" concept prioritizes issues connected with the shift of the national industry to a digital technology platform. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), based on the Internet of things technology, is currently adopting the position of the main driving force of the industrial revolution, while being one of the key factors for improving production efficiency. Development of the IIoT projects will result in the improvement of industrial efficiency, thereby having an enormous effect on the world economy. As a result, potential consequences will not only enhance the industry itself, but also many other aspects of social life related to it, such as living standards, labor market, education, political system, and etc. This study observes the history and prerequisites for the Industrial Revolution, identifies its main characteristics, and concentrates on the most advanced technologies. The research considers foreign experience in implementation of state programs in the Industry 4.0; defines a role of the Internet of things as a technological basis for a new digital economy; studies the IIoT concept as a key factor in the evolution of the Industrial Revolution; examines main advantages of the IIoT, its impact and projected consequences for the world economy; provides examples of implementation of the IIoT projects in the Russian and foreign markets; analyzes specific characteristics of the IIoT development in the Russian economy, as well as the factors hindering implementation of the IIoT projects. As a result of this study, priority tasks and prospects for development of the Industrial Internet of Things were outlined and evaluated.},

abstract = {Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-to-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.},

abstract = {In an in-situ workflow, multiple components such as simulation and analysis applications are coupled with streaming data transfers. The multiplicity of possible configurations necessitates an auto-tuner for workflow optimization. Existing auto-tuning approaches are computationally expensive because many configurations must be sampled by running the whole workflow repeatedly in order to train the auto-tuner surrogate model or otherwise explore the configuration space. To reduce these costs, we instead combine the performance models of component applications by exploiting the analytical workflow structure, selectively generating test configurations to measure and guide the training of a machine learning workflow surrogate model. Because the training can focus on well-performing configurations, the resulting surrogate model can achieve high prediction accuracy for good configurations despite training with fewer total configurations. Experiments with real applications demonstrate that our approach can identify significantly better configurations than other approaches for a fixed computer time budget.},
