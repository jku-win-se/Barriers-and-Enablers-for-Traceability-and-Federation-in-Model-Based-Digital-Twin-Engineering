Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-09-25,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85123040661

All rights reserved.A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.","cyber-physical system, Engineering education, IIoT, industrial Internet of Things, industry 4.0",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4.0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <Industry 4.0: A bibliometric analysis and detailed overview, {eid: 85058153358}>, <Industry 4.0 technologies: Implementation patterns in manufacturing companies, {eid: 85060082633}>, <Industry 4.0-A Glimpse, {eid: 85042481468}>, <Comprehensive analysis of design principles in the context of industry 4.0, {eid: 85087312022}>, <Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment, {eid: 84905408361}>, <Industry 4.0: A survey on technologies, applications and open research issues, {eid: 85020118455}>, <Learning industrial cyber-physical systems and industry 4.0-compliant solutions, {eid: 85098719459}>, <Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions, {eid: 84876943063}>, <Towards smart factory for Industry 4.0: A self-organized multi-agent system with big data based feedback and coordination, {eid: 84956858823}>, <Requirements for education and qualification of people in industry 4.0, {eid: 85029864104}>, <An effect analysis of industry 4.0 to higher education, {eid: 85007323746}>, <Adapting engineering education to industry 4.0 vision, {eid: 85147584883}>, <Engineering education for smart 4.0 technology: A review, {eid: 85088829517}>, <Literature review of industry 4.0 and related technologies, {eid: 85050613632}>, <None, {eid: 85049949184}>, <Engineering education 4.0:-Proposal for a new curricula, {eid: 85048100855}>, <Smart education in the context of industry 4.0, {eid: 85067437745}>, <None, {eid: 85091694618}>, <Analysis of education requirements for electronics manufacturing within concept industry 4.0, {eid: 85053351424}>, <Learning factory: The path to industry 4.0, {eid: 85020934245}>, <Learning factory for industry 4.0 to provide future skills beyond technical training, {eid: 85050638445}>, <Impact of training methods on distributed situation awareness of industrial operators, {eid: 84916895100}>, <CyTrONE: An integrated cybersecurity training framework, {eid: 85042645542}>, <A mixed-reality learning environment, {eid: 84964076404}>, <Remote and virtual labs for engineering education 4.0: Achievements of the ELLI project at the TU Dortmund University, {eid: 85052880296}>, <Virtual and remote labs in control education: A survey, {eid: 84995593679}>, <Active learning in engineering education.

Battery state of health estimation is essential for optimizing the battery usage, performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles. Estimating the state of health of a battery is a complex undertaking due to its dependency on multiple factors. These factors include battery characteristics such as type, chemistry, size, temperature, current, voltage, impedance, cycle number, and driving pattern. There are drawbacks to traditional methods, such as experimental and model-based approaches, in terms of accuracy, complexity, expense, and viability for real-time applications. By employing a variety of algorithms to discover the nonlinear and dynamic link between the battery parameters and the state of health, data-driven techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven digital twin technologies can get beyond these restrictions. Data-driven methods can also incorporate physics and domain knowledge to improve the explainability and interpretability of the results. This paper reviews the latest advancements and challenges of using data-driven techniques for battery state of health estimation and management in electric vehicles. The paper also discusses the future directions and opportunities for further research and development in this field. The survey scope spans publications from the year 2021 to 2023.","battery health prediction, data-driven methods, deep learning models, digital twin technology, electric vehicles, lithium-ion

The prototype was designed as two cascaded stages; an interleaved multi-branch boost topology followed by an inductor-less resonant topology. Traditionally, resonant converters use an external inductor, separating the resonant tank from the transformer. This has practical reasons but also has the drawback of an additional component and added weight. For this reason, the design exploits the leakage inductance of the transformer. However, the first prototype was overheating even in no-load conditions.This paper presents the optimization study conducted to eliminate this overheating. The analysis and simulations performed allowed to identify and pinpoint the source of the issue, namely highlighting the role of the parasitic capacitances in the high di/dt current step in the transformer. Simulations where first done to rough out the problem and get a better understanding of the different interactions between various parasitic elements. A literature review was conducted, and a theoretical analysis method was then applied. This allowed to estimate the order of magnitude of the transformer's parasitic capacitances and helped fine tune the simulation model. Based on the performed analysis, recommendations and specifications were prepared for a new transformer. An new optimized transformer was then built and tested. The results were better than expected. The parasitics were reduced by 90%, showing that the issue had correctly been identified and addressed.","Converter circuit, High frequency power converter, Interleaved converters, Silicon Carbide (SiC), Transformer",,,,,,,,"<Modular ict based energy management system for a lvdc-microgrid with local pv production and integrated electrochemical storage, {eid: 85028681677, doi: 10.1109/ICDCM.2017.8001056}>, <Power electronics for a lvdc-microgrid with local pv production and electrolytic converter, {eid: 85098231164, doi: 10.1109/ICDCM45535.2019.9232816}>, <A bidirectional dc/dc interleaved converter for supercapacitor applications, {eid: 84882287714, doi: 10.1109/EDERC.2012.6532244}>, <Dynamic modeling of a bidirectional dc/dc interleaved converter working in discontinuous mode for stationary and traction supercapacitor applications, {eid: 84866923148, doi: 10.1109/SPEEDAM.2012.6264504}>, <None, {eid: 85049110238}>, <Experimental determination of stray capacitances in high frequency transformers, {eid: 0141675988, doi: 10.1109/TPEL.2003.816186}>, <Stray capacitances of two winding transformers: Equivalent circuit, measurements, calculation and lowering, {eid: 0028756195, doi: 10.1109/ias.1994.377552}>, <Testing methods for measuring the effects of stray capacitances on high-voltage current transformers, {eid: 85027948347, doi: 10.1109/TIM.2015.2393395}>, <Experimental extraction of parasitic capacitances for high-frequency transformers, {eid: 85013028662, doi: 10.1109/TPEL.2016.2597498}>, <Modeling and analysis of parasitic capacitance of secondary winding in high-frequency high-voltage transformer using finite-element method, {eid: 85041679810, doi: 10.1109/TASC.2018.2794476}>, <A finite-element analysis approach to determine the parasitic capacitances of high-frequency multiwinding transformers for photovoltaic inverters, {eid: 84877822619, doi: 10.1109/PECI.2013.6506044}>, <Numerical modeling of capacitive effects in hf multiwinding transformers-part II: Identification using the finite-element method, {eid: 84877847375}>, <Numerical modeling of capacitive effects in hf multiwinding transformers-part i: A rigorous formalism based on the electrostatic equations, {eid: 84877863822, doi: 10.1109/TMAG.2013.2243421}>, <Lumped parameter models for single-and multiple-layer inductors, {eid: 0029747796, doi: 10.1109/pesc.1996.548595}>, <Self-capacitance of inductors, {eid: 0031175866, doi: 10.1109/63.602562}>, <Using transformer parasitics for resonant converters-a review of the calculation of the stray capacitance of transformers, {eid: 39849095428, doi: 10.1109/TIA.2007.912722}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-09-06,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85119079898

It is these approaches that pave the way for data lakes, Authoritative Sources of Truth (ASOTs), and systems-of-systems interoperability and the corresponding transformational benefits thereof. Such benefits include increased data availability, data access equity, data traceability, real-Time analytics, batch analytics, and (most importantly) acceleration of the time-To-value and time-To-insights associated with engineering products and analyses. The longer-Term benefits of reusability, customization and traceability are even more promising.For Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA), and Mission Success (SMS) activities; realization of such benefits is essential to provide engineers and analysts alike vital information when needed to support critical decision making throughout the entire life cycle. The SMA community often operate in parallel with engineering activities, for which information exchange with relevant context is paramount. Far too often, such information lags key decision points and/or is absent of the robust, integrated, knowledge needed, given inherent barriers associated with traditional document-centric means to data sharing, analysis, and reporting.This paper provides an overview of how NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evolving its policies, standards, guidance, and training to transform to eliminate such barriers, thus realizing the benefits emerging in this new digital era.

"Celik A. (AUID: 56542749700), Eltawil A.M. (AUID: 55939256800)",At the Dawn of Generative AI Era: A Tutorial-cum-Survey on New Frontiers in 6G Wireless Intelligence,2024,IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society,5,10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3362271,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/OJCOMS.2024.3362271,"<King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division>",,"© 2020 IEEE.As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.","5G,

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-12-14,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85099750826

The problem statement for this paper could be considered as authorship attribution using stylometric features on Bangla lyrics. We have utilized the BanglaMusicStylo dataset, which consists of 856 and 620 songs of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, respectively. The traditional authorship attribution works found in the literature are based on the novels written by the authors, not Bangla song lyrics. Using the Bangla song lyrics made it a challenging task, as the word choices made by the authors in songs depends on the rhythms, completeness, situation and many more. In this paper, we have tried to fusion different types of stylometric features, such as lexical, structural, stylistic etc. For experimentation, we have designed the prediction model based on supervised learning exploiting Naïve Bayes (NB), Simple Logistic Regression (SLR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The experimental model consists of several steps including data pre-processing, feature extraction, data processing, and classification model. After performance evaluation, we have got approximately 86.29% accuracy from SLR, which is quite satisfactory.","Authorship Attribution, BanglaMusicStylo Dataset, Linguistic Feature, Stylometric Features, Supervised Learning",,,,,,,,"<Authorship attribution of texts: A review, {eid: 34247135508}>, <Computational methods in authorship attribution, {eid: 58449112832}>, <Authorship effects in the prediction of handwriting strokes: Evidence for action simulation during action perception, {eid: 0036637005, doi: 10.1080/02724980143000631}>, <Bucketed common vector scaling for authorship attribution in heterogeneous web collections: A scaling approach for authorship attribution, {eid: 85092400189}>, <Independent component analysis at the neural cocktail party, {eid: 0035054585, doi: 10.1016/s0166-2236(00)01683-0}>, <Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries, {eid: 77950327510}>, <A stylometric analysis on bengali literature for authorship attribution, {eid: 85050501538}>, <Banglamusicstylo: A stylometric dataset of bangla music lyrics, {eid: 85060022811}>, <Authorship attribution for bengali language using the fusion of n-gram and naive bayes algorithms, {eid: 85076672449}>, <None, {eid: 85085015509}>, <N-gram-based author profiles for authorship attribution, {eid: 33745868242}>, <None, {eid: 84904344454}>, <Authorship attribution in bengali language, {eid: 85050386087}>, <Authorship identification in bengali language: A graph based approach, {eid: 85006778844}>, <Author based rank vector coordinates (arvc) model for authorship attribution, {eid: 85044027908}>, <Nltk: The natural language toolkit, {eid: 70349303093}>, <Recognizing language and emotional tone from music lyrics using ibm watson tone analyzer, {eid: 85074325987}>, <Recommendation approach of english songs title based on latent dirichlet allocation applied on lyrics, {eid: 85074371452}>, <An empirical study of the naive bayes classifier, {eid: 3843106208}>, <None, {eid: 44649119152}>, <A survey of decision tree classifier methodology, {eid: 0026154509}>, <None, {eid: 0004322632}>, <Multilayer perceptron, fuzzy sets, and classification, {eid: 0026927426}>, <Weka: A machine learning workbench, {eid: 0041561903}>, <Comparison of the predicted and observed secondary structure of t4 phage lysozyme, {eid: 0016772212}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-09-27,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85084978601

The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.","automotive, aviation, digital twin, maritime, simulation method",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin in aerospace industry: A gentle introduction, {eid: 85122087744}>, <Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review, {eid: 85145283461}>, <Towards the future of smart electric vehicles: Digital twin technology, {eid: 85101382380}>, <Digital twin applications in aviation industry: A review, {eid: 85135421849}>, <A digital twin of the research vessel Gunnerus for lifecycle services: Outlining key technologies, {eid: 85174368733}>, <From ROM of electrochemistry to AI-based battery digital and hybrid twin, {eid: 85080982468}>, <Towards virtual twin for electronic packages in automotive applications, {eid: 85106914513}>, <Fault diagnosis of intelligent production line based on digital twin and improved random forest, {eid: 85113522726}>, <A detection and configuration method for welding completeness in the automotive body-in-white panel based on digital twin, {eid: 85130029875}>, <Bending waves focusing in arbitrary shaped plate-like structures: Application to spatial audio in cars, {eid: 85089246544}>, <Digital twin modeling of a solar car based on the hybrid model method with data-driven and mechanistic, {eid: 85110697727}>, <DMulti-Vehicle Trajectory Tracking towards Digital Twin Intersections for Internet of Vehicles, {eid: 85146784233}>, <A novel digital twin-centric approach for driver intention prediction and traffic congestion avoidance, {eid: 85062692056}>, <Dedicated adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm for digital twin based control optimization of the plug-in hybrid vehicle, {eid: 85173620198}>, <A digital twin framework for aircraft hydraulic systems failure detection using machine learning techniques, {eid: 85141409916}>, <Towards aircraft maintenance metaverse using speech interactions with virtual objects in mixed reality, {eid: 85102467195}>, <Digital twin-driven aero-engine intelligent predictive maintenance, {eid: 85105375338}>, <Digital twin-driven reconfigurable fixturing optimization for trimming operation of aircraft skins, {eid: 85126658906}>, <Towards a digital twin approach for vessel-specific fatigue damage monitoring and prognosis, {eid: 85120321957}>, <Digital twin-based scheduling method for marine equipment material transportation vehicles, {eid: 85141728319}>, <Digital twin-driven approach for process management and traceability towards ship industry, {eid: 85131543381}>, <Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling, {eid: 85067817812}>, <An uncertainty-aware hybrid approach for sea state estimation using ship motion responses, {eid: 85104569548}>, <Incorporating approximate dynamics into data-driven calibrator: A representative model for ship maneuvering prediction, {eid: 85112147169}>, <Holistic digital-twin-based framework to improve tunnel lighting environment: From methodology to application, {eid: 85137170907}>, <Design and simulation of a digital twin mobility concept: An electric aviation system dynamics case study with capacity constraints, {eid: 85122889156}>, <Integrated design and control approach for marine power systems based on operational data digital twin to design, {eid: 85114458059}>, <A digital twin case study on automotive production line, {eid: 85138329747}>, <Needs, requirements and a concept of a tool condition monitoring system for the aerospace industry, {eid: 85111334279}>, <Using digital twin in a shipbuilding project, {eid: 85144848278}>, <Vision-cloud data fusion for ADAS: A lane change prediction case study, {eid: 85135247150}>, <Unsupervised data-preprocessing for long short-term memory based battery model under electric vehicle operation, {eid: 85104663507}>, <Digital twin of a hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle: Effect of the control strategy on energy efficiency, {eid: 85173615614}>, <A physics-based digital twin for model predictive control of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle landing, {eid: 85132312830}>, <Real-time digital twin for ship operation in waves, {eid: 85140273039}>, <Coupling of dynamic reaction forces of a heavy load crane and ship motion responses in waves, {eid: 85104257946}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-08-18,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85173614838

Information Science & Systems>, <Towson University, Dept. Computer& Information Science>, <School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Dept. Emergency Medicine>",,"© 2023 IEEE.Effective communication of patient clinical and care information between pre-hospital services and Emergency Departments (EDs) is crucial for the rapid and effective treatment of patients, potentially saving lives. Recent research indicates a frequent lack of patient data metrics, such as vital signs, which represents a potential limitation in the comprehensiveness of handoffs received by ED physicians from pre-hospital providers. To address this challenge, we propose a solution that utilizes a patient's digital twin and permissioned blockchain technology to ensure complete, real-time, secure, and shareable access to patients' vital signs and other data metrics for Emergency Departments. This solution seeks to answer the following questions: Which data model for the digital twin best represents the patient during transport, meeting the requirements of the receiving facility? How can patient digital twin data, including the history of clinical information and patient care, be shared in real-time with the receiving facility? How can EHR-compliant digital twin data be produced to satisfy the reconciliation between the Patient Digital Twin (PDT) and the Electronic Health Record (EHR)? Method: We conducted a comprehensive literature review and a series of interviews with both pre-hospital and hospital care providers to identify the problem and develop a model based on it. To address the second question, we designed an architecture that includes all parties in the care team, during and after the transport. For the third question, we explored NEMSIS data exchange standards and a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module. Objective: Our goal is to improve the survivability of patients in emergency care through secure, effective, and real-time sharing of patient metric data between Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Emergency Departments or Trauma Centers. This approach also aims to reduce the waiting time for patients upon arrival at the receiving facility.","Blockchain-based digital twin, Emergency departments, EMS, Hyperledger Fabric, IOMT, Pre-hospital",,,,,,,,"<Effective Communication In EMS, {eid: 85187215861}>, <Evaluating the Content and Quality of Emergency Medical Services Oral Patient Handoff Reports, {eid: 85187228178}>, <User Needs and Challenges in Information Sharing between Pre-Hospital and Hospital Emergency Care Providers, {eid: 85126636103}>, <Differences in Prehospital Patient Assessments for Pediatric Versus Adult Patients, {eid: 85046847598}>, <IoT-Based Ambulatory Vital Signs Data Transfer System, {eid: 85057407988}>, <Level of Agreement between Prehospital and Emergency Department Vital Signs in Trauma Patients, {eid: 84885179155}>, <Experimental Implementation of NSER Mobile App for Efficient Real-Time Sharing of Prehospital Patient Information With Emergency Departments, {eid: 85134384000}>, <Personal Digital Twin: A Close Look into the Present and a Step towards the Future of Personalized Healthcare Industry, {eid: 85187238353}>, <On the Integration of Agents and Digital Twins in Healthcare, {eid: 85088988374}>, <None, {eid: 85187217335}>, <A Blockchain-Based System for Healthcare Digital Twin, {eid: 85130853693}>, <A Web Deployment of Secured ECG Signal Medical Record Transactions using Blockchain, {eid: 85187219310}>, <Newborn Emergency Transport Based on the Fifth-Generation Wireless Networks and Blockchain, {eid: 85127164663}>, <Digital Twin Conceptual Model within the Context of Internet of Things, {eid: 85093837667}>, <Digital Twins, Internet of Things and Mobile Medicine: A Review of Current Platforms to Support Smart Healthcare, {eid: 85121794544}>, <Digital Twin Paradigm: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85171958140}>, <Barriers to Effective EMS to Emergency Department Information Transfer at Patient Handover: A Systematic Review, {eid: 85083288011}>, <The Value of Vital Sign Trends in Predicting and Monitoring Clinical Deterioration: A Systematic Review, {eid: 85060041320}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-05-23,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85187223056

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

Previous reviews have documented the development of model-based and data-driven control in isolation and have not critically reviewed reinforcement learning approaches for adaptive data-driven optimal control frameworks. The presented review discusses the development of model-based to model-free adaptive controllers, highlighting the use of data in control frameworks. In data-driven control frameworks, reinforcement learning methods may be used to derive the optimal policy for dynamical systems. Attractive characteristics of these methods include not requiring a mathematical model of complex systems, their inherent adaptive control capabilities, being an unsupervised learning technique and their decision-making abilities, which are both an advantage and motivation behind this approach. This review considers previous reviews on these topics, including recent work on data-driven control methods. In addition, this review shows the use of data to derive system dynamics, determine the control policy using feedback information, and tune fixed controllers. Furthermore, the review summarises various data-driven methods and their corresponding characteristics. Finally, the review provides a taxonomy, a timeline and a concise narrative of the development of model-based to model-free data-driven adaptive control and underlines the limitations of these techniques due to the lack of theoretical analysis. Areas of further work include theoretical analysis on stability and robustness for data-driven control systems, explainability of black-box policy learning techniques and an evaluation of the impact of the extension of system simulators to include digital twins.","adaptive control, Data-driven control, learning-based control, model predictive control, model-based, model-free, optimal control, systematic review",,,,,,,,"<Data-driven predictive control for autonomous systems, {eid: 85052563990}>, <Control and machine intelligence for system autonomy, {eid: 85050405192}>, <Learningbased model predictive control: Toward safe learning in control, {eid: 85082623143}>, <Learning model predictive control for iterative tasks.

Firstly, the application status of cutting-edge Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model in transportation infrastructure efficiency evaluation is analyzed, and based on this, a DEA model of transportation infrastructure efficiency evaluation under Digital Twins technology is established. Secondly, with the transportation infrastructure of 12 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province from 2005 to 2020 as the research object, the Digital Twins DEA model and the traditional Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) model are used to estimate the efficiency of transportation infrastructure in 12 cities. Finally, the traffic flow data of a certain road section in Zhenjiang City (J11 City) is simulated and predicted by using the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) traffic flow prediction model. The results show that the average efficiency of the 12 cities estimated by the DEA model based on the Digital Twins is 0.7083, the average efficiency of the 12 cities estimated by the SFA model is 0.6445, and there are significant differences in the efficiency rankings of the cities. Compared with the actual efficiency, the established Digital Twins DEA model is more reasonable for the calculation of transportation infrastructure efficiency. The results of the LSTM traffic flow prediction model show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the LSTM model is 24.29, the Root Mean Square Error (RSME) is 0.1186, and the Mean Absolute Perce (MAPE) is 17.78, which are all lower than other models. Compared with other models, the proposed LSTM-based traffic flow prediction model is more accurate in traffic flow prediction. Hence, the research content provides a reference for the investment planning of intelligent transportation system infrastructure.","DEA, Digital twins, efficiency evaluation, LSTM",,,,,,,,"<Worlding cities through transportation infrastructure, {eid: 85059948704}>, <Lecture notes in intelligent transportation and infrastructure innovative research in transportation infrastructure (Proceedings of ICIIF 2018) || an innovative approach to assess sustainability of urban mobility-using fuzzy MCDM method, {eid: 85142361092}>, <Mitigation of geohazard risk along transportation infrastructures with optical fiber distributed sensing, {eid: 85142336611}>, <Comparative study on cyclic behavior of marine calcareous sand and terrigenous siliceous sand for transportation infrastructure applications, {eid: 85101823137}>, <Can financial development improve the investment efficiency of transportation infrastructure?

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model's security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system's multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and 0.01∼ 0.05λ value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","Digital twins, Internet of Things, maritime silk road, maritime transportation system, relay cooperation",,,,,,,,"<Multimedia knowledge-based bridge health monitoring using digital twin, {eid: 85121917520}>, <Using digital twin technology to ensure data quality in transport systems, {eid: 85103577138}>, <Data fusion-based sustainable digital twin system of intelligent detection robotics, {eid: 85091892427}>, <Vision, requirements and network architecture of 6G mobile network beyond 2030, {eid: 85094882783}>, <Systems engineering and digital twin: A vision for the future of cruise ships design, production and operations, {eid: 85074479906}>, <The economics of digital twins, {eid: 85104527345}>, <Enabling the maritime Internet of Things: CoAP and 6LoWPAN performance over VHF links, {eid: 85052816647}>, <Performance analysis of FD-NOMA-based decentralized V2X systems, {eid: 85069788734}>, <Energy-efficient end-to-end security for software-defined vehicular networks, {eid: 85105561785}>, <Application of ship electric propulsion based on Internet of Things system and electronic system, {eid: 85098624900}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367}>, <Adaptive federated learning and digital twin for industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85105574016}>, <Application of digital twin and IoT concepts for solving the tasks of hydraulically actuated heavy equipment lifecycle management, {eid: 85096688331}>, <Multifidelity computing for coupling full and reduced order models, {eid: 85101309377}>, <Digital twins in industry: Benefits and traps, {eid: 85146550332}>, <Energy-efficient secure transmission design for the Internet of Things with an untrusted relay, {eid: 85042868925}>, <Secrecy performance analysis for fixed-gain energy harvesting in an Internet of Things with untrusted relays, {eid: 85052622806}>, <Random access and detection performance of Internet of Things for smart ocean, {eid: 85092736733}>, <Energyefficient secure transmission for wireless powered Internet of Things with multiple power beacons, {eid: 85057890946}>, <Secure beamforming design in relay-assisted Internet of Things, {eid: 85070206055}>, <Relay cooperation enhanced backscatter communication for Internet-of-Things, {eid: 85055017833}>, <Inconspicuous manipulation for social-aware relay selection in flying Internet of Things, {eid: 85073686729}>, <Energy-aware real-time routing for large-scale industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85045681808}>, <Quasi-optimization of distance and blocklength in URLLC aided multi-hop UAV relay links, {eid: 85081595881}>, <An ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework for health and well-being in smart cities, {eid: 85086741550}>, <Digital twin to improve the virtualreal integration of industrial IoT, {eid: 85098952548}>, <Manufacturing blockchain of things for the configuration of a data and knowledge-driven digital twin manufacturing cell, {eid: 85091685980}>, <Digital twin design for realtime monitoring-A case study of die cutting machine, {eid: 85090962625}>, <Efficient and secure data sharing for 5G flying drones: A blockchain-enabled approach, {eid: 85100412110}>, <Investigating the prospect of leveraging blockchain and machine learning to secure vehicular networks: A survey, {eid: 85099690444, doi: 10.1109/TITS.2020.3019101}>, <Digital twin for 5G and beyond, {eid: 85102889168}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-02-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85120537831

Currently, cyberspace security becomes increasingly complicated. Intrusion detection and Deep Learning (DL) are combined with shunning security threats in service computing systems and improving network defense capabilities. DTs can be applied to network security. People's understanding of cyberspace security can be improved using DTs to digitally define, model, and display the network environment and security status. The intrusion detection data are optimized based on DL technology, and a network intrusion detection algorithm integrated with Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed. In the cloud service system, a trust model based on Keyed-Hashing-based Self-Synchronization (KHSS) is introduced. This model predicts the security state and detects attacks according to existing malicious attacks, ensuring the network security defense system's regular operation. Finally, simulation experiments verify the Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model's feasibility and the cloud trust model. The DBN algorithm proposed improves the correct detection rate of unknown samples by 4.05% compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. From the 20,100 pieces of data in the test dataset, the number of correct attacks detected by the DBN algorithm exceeds those by the SVM algorithm by 818. DBN algorithm requires a short detection time while ensuring optimal detection accuracy. The KHSS+DBN model predicts cloud security states, and the results are the same as the actual states, with an error of only 1%∼2%.","Deep learning, digital twins, network attack, security defense, service computing system",,,,,,,,"<Adeep learning approach to network intrusion detection, {eid: 85082634024}>, <Big privacy: Challenges and opportunities of privacy study in the age of Big Data, {eid: 84979812487}>, <Networking for Big Data: A survey, {eid: 85014086530}>, <Survey on SDN based network intrusion detection system using machine learning approaches, {eid: 85040375894}>, <Dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis for network intrusion detection, {eid: 85002547329}>, <An effective combining classifier approach using tree algorithms for network intrusion detection, {eid: 84975106423}>, <Anovel architecture combined with optimal parameters for back propagation neural networks applied to anomaly network intrusion detection, {eid: 85042208991}>, <Adversarial attacks against network intrusion detection in IoT systems, {eid: 85099107269}>, <Network intrusion detection: Based on deep hierarchical network and original flow data, {eid: 85065232448}>, <Deep learning approach combining sparse autoencoder with SVM for network intrusion detection, {eid: 85053343902}>, <An industrial network intrusion detection algorithm based on multifeature data clustering optimization model, {eid: 85078501372}>, <In-vehicle network intrusion detection using deep convolutional neural network, {eid: 85073150001}>, <A QoS-driven approach to the cloud service addressing attributes of security, {eid: 85048874016}>, <A trust-based agent learning model for service composition in mobile cloud computing environments, {eid: 85063797072}>, <A survey on distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks inSDNand cloud computing environments, {eid: 85068979321}>, <Interactive three-dimensional visualization of network intrusion detection data for machine learning, {eid: 85070713287}>, <A machine learning-based approach to build zero false-positive IPSs for industrial IoT and CPS with a case study on power grids security, {eid: 85183585229, doi: 10.1109/TIA.2020.3011397}>, <A data augmentation-based defense method against adversarial attacks in neural networks, {eid: 85092719046}>, <Adversarial attacks against network intrusion detection in IoT systems, {eid: 85099107269}>, <An efficient and robust deep learning based network anomaly detection against distributed denial of service attacks, {eid: 85088643853}>, <A highly accurate deep learning based approach for developing wireless sensor networkmiddleware, {eid: 85048185131}>, <Intelligent fault diagnosis by fusing domain adversarial training and maximum mean discrepancy via ensemble learning, {eid: 85099517118}>, <Data poison detection schemes for distributed machine learning, {eid: 85077274847}>, <A deep learning ensemble for network anomaly and cyberattack detection, {eid: 85089532738}>, <Intelligent fault diagnosis by fusing domain adversarial training and maximum mean discrepancy via ensemble learning, {eid: 85099517118}>, <An adaptive ensemble machine learning model for intrusion detection, {eid: 85068687156}>, <Deep learning for detection of routing attacks in the Internet of Things, {eid: 85062708145}>, <A novel deep learning model for detection of denial of service attacks in HTTP traffic over internet, {eid: 85083972007}>, <A comprehensive novel model for network speech anomaly detection system using deep learning approach, {eid: 85081624018}>, <A prediction system of Sybil attack in social network using deep-regression model, {eid: 85029219783}>, <Dynamic management of a deep learning-based anomaly detection system for 5G networks, {eid: 85049566253}>, <Introducing deep learning self-Adaptive misuse network intrusion detection systems, {eid: 85061832103}>, <Forensics and deep learning mechanisms for botnets in Internet of Things: A survey of challenges and solutions, {eid: 85066801945}>, <Intrusion detection system using deep neural network for in-vehicle network security, {eid: 84975321732}>, <Can we beat DDoS attacks in clouds?, {eid: 84906077010}>, <Fool me if you can:Mimicking attacks and anti-Attacks in cyberspace, {eid: 84919476166}>, <Research on cloud computing security risk assessment based on information entropy andMarkov chain, {eid: 85062702225}>, <Cloud computing review: Concepts, technology, challenges and security, {eid: 85044289704}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2024-03-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85165915675

The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.","6G, AI for networking, digital twin, network architecture, network

We measured the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR, 400 – 2500 nm) spectral reflectance of 322 topsoil samples. The spectral reflectance was converted to continuum removal curves, and then, SCPs were extracted based on the curves. According to the results of the Second National Soil Survey of China, the samples were divided into 4 great groups or 8 genus, and a variety of stratification strategies were constructed based on great group (GR-S), genus (GE-S), spectral similarity (SS-S) and decision tree model (DT-S). A local random forest model was established to evaluate the performance of different stratification strategies and input variables. Our results are described as follows: (1) In different stratification strategies, the SOM prediction model based on DT-S exhibits the highest accuracy, followed by the SOM prediction models based on GE-S and SS-S; the SOM prediction model based on GR-S exhibits the lowest accuracy; (2) among the different input variables, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) of the best SOM model predicted by SCPs are 5.18 g kg−1 and 0.89, respectively. Compared with the original reflectance based on the nonstratified strategy, the RMSE decreases by 4.88 g kg−1 and R2 increases by 0.32. The study results highlight the advantages of refining the soil hierarchy, which is helpful for identifying the differences in soils at the regional scale and analysing the relationship between stratification results and the characteristics of the soil environment to obtain a highly accurate prediction model.","Decision tree, Density peak clustering, Soil hierarchical, Soil organic matter, Spectral characteristic parameters, Stratification strategy",,,,,,,,"<Improving the prediction performance of a large tropical vis-NIR spectroscopic soil library from Brazil by clustering into smaller subsets or use of data mining calibration techniques, {eid: 85027936542}>, <Vis-SWIR spectral prediction model for soil organic matter with different grouping strategies, {eid: 85086585713, doi: 10.1016/j.catena.2020.104703}>, <A regional-scale hyperspectral prediction model of soil organic carbon considering geomorphic features, {eid: 85107648633, doi: 10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115263}>, <A Comparison of Feature-Based MLR and PLS Regression Techniques for the Prediction of Three Soil Constituents in a Degraded South African Ecosystem, {eid: 84873862061}>, <Soil Reflectance, {eid: 0000397108}>, <Global soil characterization with VNIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, {eid: 33646251126}>, <Reflectance spectroscopy: quantitative analysis techniques for remote sensing applications, {eid: 0021644332}>, <High spectral resolution reflectance spectroscopy of minerals, {eid: 0042894381, doi: 10.1029/JB095iB08p12653}>, <Prediction of soil texture classes through different wavelength regions of reflectance spectroscopy at various soil depths, {eid: 85078405712, doi: 10.1016/j.catena.2020.104485}>, <Measuring and monitoring soil organic carbon stocks in agricultural lands for climate mitigation, {eid: 79955426473}>, <Simultaneous prediction of several soil properties related to engineering uses based on laboratory Vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy, {eid: 85094141166, doi: 10.1016/j.catena.2020.104987}>, <Analysis of VNIR (400–1100 nm) spectral signatures for estimation of soil organic matter intropical soils of Thailand, {eid: 1342309508}>, <Gene selection and classification of microarray data using random forest, {eid: 30644464444}>, <Two pre-processing techniques to reduce model covariables in soil property predictions by Vis-NIR spectroscopy, {eid: 85019575560}>, <Prediction of soil organic matter using multi-temporal satellite images in the Songnen Plain, {eid: 85071430671, doi: 10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113896}>, <Evaluating Soil Color with Farmer Input and Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity for Management Zone Delineation, {eid: 9944247638}>, <Numerical soil horizon classification from South Africas legacy database, {eid: 85109001530, doi: 10.1016/j.catena.2021.105543}>, <Variability of laboratory measured soil lines of soils from southeastern Brazil, {eid: 0031988537}>, <Pedology, {eid: 85056152636}>, <Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy for estimating soil characteristics valuable in the diagnosis of soil fertility, {eid: 79956077553}>, <Optimization criteria in sample selection step of local regression for quantitative analysis of large soil NIRS database, {eid: 83655167381}>, <Using vis-NIR and pXRF data to distinguish soil parent materials – An example using 136 pedons from Wisconsin, USA, {eid: 85103116930, doi: 10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115091}>, <Soil organic carbon concentrations and stocks on Barro Colorado Island-Digital soil mapping using random forests analysis, {eid: 48349147101}>, <Prediction of soil organic carbon stock by laboratory spectral data and airborne hyperspectral images, {eid: 85053044720}>, <Study on spectral features of soil Fe2O3, {eid: 43749098700}>, <Combination of fractional order derivative and memory-based learning algorithm to improve the estimation accuracy of soil organic matter by visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, {eid: 85056231944}>, <Prediction of soil organic carbon at the country scale: stratification strategies for near-infrared data, {eid: 85034758757}>, <An approach for hyperspectral image classification by optimizing SVM using self-organizing map, {eid: 85027989687}>, <Remote estimation of soil organic matter content in the Sanjiang Plain, Northest China: The optimal band algorithm versus the GRA-ANN model, {eid: 84953455274}>, <A remote sensing adapted approach for soil organic carbon prediction based on the spectrally clustered LUCAS soil database, {eid: 85068747213}>, <A simple method to extract spectral parameters using fractional derivative spectrometry.

However, requirements engineering capabilities are latent in comparison to complex discrete manufacturing. In this paper, we explore requirements engineering practices in Australian rail infrastructure projects creating digital twins for asset management and operations. An investigation of the challenges encountered by project teams during the development of asset information requirements for physical and digital deliverables was conducted using an in-depth literature review together with semi-structured interviews with rail project delivery teams. Challenges to the maturity of requirements engineering were categorised according to their main characteristics. The process, technology and supply chain issues identified provide empirical evidence of the pain points faced by delivery teams in developing asset information requirements in support of the creation of a digital twin.

This explicit incorporation helps (i) assess the system risk due to organizational and managerial weaknesses, (ii) identify the critical organizational root causes of failure scenarios, aiding in effective corrective action, and (iii) avoid the potential of underestimating the system risk involving human error and organizational factors. To facilitate the measurement of organizational factors contributing to the PRA scenarios, the previous studies by the authors developed the Data-Theoretic methodology, where “data analytics” are guided by a “theory” of underlying causation to prevent misleading results from solely data-oriented approaches. The Data-Theoretic methodology consists of two submodules: (a) DT-BASE that develops a detailed causal model based on a theory-building process and is equipped with a baseline quantification utilizing analyst interpretation of information extracted from relevant references; and (b) DT-SITE that conducts data analytics (text mining using machine learning) to quantify the organizational causal elements based on industry event databases. This article investigates uncertainty analysis for the uncertainties associated with machine learning-based data mining in DT-SITE using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for industry event databases. This article conducts a literature review and proposes a categorization scheme of the SVM uncertainties to establish a theoretical foundation for identifying uncertainty sources associated with the SVM classifier. The implementation of uncertainty analysis for DT-SITE is then illustrated using a nuclear power plant case study. The potential uncertainty sources related to the SVM classifier used in DT-SITE are identified using the categorization scheme developed based on the literature review. The uncertainty analysis procedure for the SVM classifier in DT-SITE is proposed, and the linkage to the current uncertainty analysis process in PRA is discussed. The proposed uncertainty analysis procedure for the SVM classifier in DT-SITE is applied to the illustrative case study to assess the impact of one of the potential uncertainty sources (i.e., the selection of document sections included in the dataset) on the risk-informed decision-making.","Machine learning, Organizational factors, Probabilistic risk assessment, Support vector machine, Uncertainty analysis",,,,,,,,"<Results uncertainty of support vector machine and hybrid of wavelet transform-support vector machine models for solid waste generation forecasting, {eid: 84891830383}>, <Applying support vector machines to imbalanced datasets, {eid: 22944452794}>, <Efficient methods for robust classification under uncertainty in kernel matrices, {eid: 84869486468}>, <Support vector classification with input data uncertainty, {eid: 84898996224}>, <Uncertainty-safe large scale support vector machines, {eid: 85008471427}>, <Uncertainty handling in model selection for support vector machines, {eid: 56449125243}>, <None, {eid: 84945166824}>, <Data Uncertainty Sensitivity Analysis for Reduced Complexity SVM Classifiers, {eid: 36049039190}>, <Support vector machine classifiers with uncertain knowledge sets via robust optimization, {eid: 84902838650}>, <Using support vector machine with a hybrid feature selection method to the stock trend prediction, {eid: 67349231310}>, <Support vector machine learning from heterogeneous data: an empirical analysis using protein sequence and structure, {eid: 33750975917}>, <Nuclear power plant components condition monitoring by probabilistic support vector machine, {eid: 84873648199}>, <Impact of feature selection on the accuracy and spatial uncertainty of per-field crop classification using support vector machines, {eid: 84884514639}>, <Incorporating organizational factors into probabilistic risk assessment of complex socio-technical systems: principles and theoretical foundations, {eid: 66049123824}>, <Incorporating organizational factors into Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of complex socio-technical systems: a hybrid technique formalization, {eid: 60249097741}>, <Incorporating organizational factors into Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of complex socio-technical systems: a hybrid technique formalization, {eid: 60249097741}>, <Handling Uncertainties in SVM Classification, {eid: 80052189854}>, <Uncertainty analysis of support vector machine for online prediction of five-day biochemical oxygen demand, {eid: 84930638631}>, <How reliable are ANN, ANFIS, and SVM techniques for predicting longitudinal dispersion coefficient in natural rivers?, {eid: 84950244991}>, <Feature selection for classification of hyperspectral data by SVM, {eid: 77951295936}>, <Support vector machine classification of uncertain and imbalanced data using robust optimization, {eid: 82955190470}>, <Handling missing values in support vector machine classifiers, {eid: 27744579949}>, <A Discourse on the Incorporation of Organizational Factors into Probabilistic Risk Assessment: Key Questions and Categorical Review, {eid: 85138781954}>, <Quantifying organizational factors in human reliability analysis using the big data-theoretic algorithm, {eid: 84945162669}>, <Data-theoretic methodology and computational platform for the quantification of organizational mechanisms in probabilistic risk assessment, {eid: 85047793036}>, <Data-Theoretic methodology and computational platform to quantify organizational factors in socio-technical risk analysis, {eid: 85059217308}>, <Data-theoretic approach for socio-technical risk analysis: text mining licensee event reports of US nuclear power plants, {eid: 85077758063}>, <Data-theoretic approach for socio-technical risk analysis: text mining licensee event reports of U.S. nuclear power plants, {eid: 85077758063}>, <A survey of machine learning for big data processing, {eid: 84971233935}>, <Prediction interval estimation of electricity prices using PSO-tuned support vector machines, {eid: 84926435343}>, <Kernel Methods for Missing Variables, {eid: 56149102278}>, <Learning SVMs from sloppily labeled data, {eid: 70350610827}>, <Guidance on the Treatment of Uncertainties Associated with PRAs in Risk-Informed Decisionmaking, {eid: 78650687212}>, <Application of support vector machines for landuse classification using high-resolution RapidEye images: a sensitivity analysis, {eid: 84947218144}>, <How to tune the RBF SVM hyperparameters?

This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes.","building information modeling, building lifecycle data, building permits, city information model, digital twins, GeoBIM, information model-based urban planning",,,,,,,,"<Automatic rule-based checking of building designs, {eid: 70349429622, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2009.07.002}>, <BIM for public authorities: Basic research for the standardized implementation of BIM in the building permit process, {eid: 85073033386, doi: 10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012102}>, <None, {eid: 85199664264}>, <A State-of-the-Art Review on the Integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS), {eid: 85014918203, doi: 10.3390/ijgi6020053}>, <From Geotechnical Data to GeoBIM Models: Testing Strategies for an Ex-Industrial Site in Turin, {eid: 85172807488, doi: 10.3390/buildings13092343}>, <BIM- and GIS-Based Life-Cycle-Assessment Framework for Enhancing Eco Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector, {eid: 85185888364, doi: 10.3390/buildings14020360}>, <An integrated building information modeling (BIM)-based lifecycle-oriented framework for sustainable building design, {eid: 85139162343, doi: 10.1108/CI-02-2021-0011}>, <Asset Information Model Management-Based GIS/BIM Integration in Facility Management Contract, {eid: 85189030595, doi: 10.3390/su16062495}>, <None, {eid: 38649094993}>, <Building Information Modeling: Why?

As modernizing and expanding airport infrastructures receive a higher priority, addressing inefficiencies in capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) through transformative digital ecosystems is gaining an increasing level of interest. Building information modeling (BIM) can form a basis to enable an end-to-end digital delivery platform, where airport life cycle data can be utilized for actionable insights. This study proposes a scalable, novel BIM-based modularized platform architecture based on model-based system engineering (MBSE) principles with systems modeling language (SysML) for optimal collection, integration, management, and utilization of airport critical asset data. This platform architecture aims at acting as a metaframework that enables an airport digital twin through cohesive and structured view of asset life cycle information for insightful actions by major airport stakeholders. Research methodology features an online survey and focus group discussions for data collection; mixed method analysis for data analysis; MBSE with SysML for data mapping; and prototype demonstration and an expert opinion survey for validation.

In this paper, the performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is founded on an in-depth analysis of satisfaction survey responses and a thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to 2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor data, occupants’ feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants’ comfort, and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants’ comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well as a predictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help decision-makers improve the occupants’ comfort conditions in buildings. However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and the absence of data integration among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying equipment malfunctions, and pointing toward possible solutions.","Building information modelling (BIM), Decision-making, Digital twin, Facility management, Fault detection, Predictive

Therefore, it is necessary to study complex system interactions to enhance overall efficiency. This study focuses on the task interface of a digital twin system for computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools and examines the relationship between the user mental model and interface design elements. Key mental information is obtained through questionnaires and interviews, forming the basis for establishing a user mental model. High-frequency information words are extracted, experimental samples are designed, and importance rating surveys are conducted. Quantitative analysis methods, including factor analysis and weight calculation, are utilized to analyze the needs of target users. Consequently, a user demand hierarchy model is constructed. This approach aims to effectively reduce user errors in the human-computer interaction process within complex systems and enhance cognitive efficiency.","Complex system, Human-computer interaction, Mental model, Visual interface",,,,,,,,"<Incorporating personality in user interface design: a review, {eid: 85076013939, doi: 10.1016/j.paid.2019.109709}>, <A study on the mental models of users concerning existing software, {eid: 85127022278, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-98464-9_18}>, <How the preattentive process is exploited in practical information visualization design: a review, {eid: 85129442377, doi: 10.1080/10447318.2022.2049137}>, <The elements of user experience: user-centered design for the Web and beyond, {eid: 85124163427, doi: 10.5860/CHOICE.49-0321}>, <The effect of systemic sclerosis on use of mobile touchscreen interfaces: design guidelines and physio-rehabilitation, {eid: 85121252112, doi: 10.1016/j.ergon.2021.103256}>, <A motion‐guided interface for modeling 3D multi‐functional furniture, {eid: 85119983341, doi: 10.1111/cgf.14416}>, <Review and analysis of color coding research for visual displays, {eid: 0016683148, doi: 10.1177/001872087501700602}>, <Effects of Asymmetry between Design Models and User Models on Subjective Comprehension of User Interface, {eid: 85105868472, doi: 10.3390/sym13050795}>, <Investigating design cognition in the construction and enactment of team mental models, {eid: 84870458463, doi: 10.1016/j.destud.2012.05.003}>, <Best practices for mixed methods research in the health sciences john W.

This paper will contribute a framework and an entire toolchain to present a holistic and systematic approach for development of future robotic AGV systems. In the first section this paper will present the first descriptive study which is the literature survey and the definition of the scientific gaps and research questions related to systematic approaches based on Systems Engineering and Model Based System Engineering. In section number two this paper will present a new approach and framework called “Munich Agile Concept for Modell based Systems Engineering (MAGIC)” to develop entire virtual tool chains for virtualization and simulation of different functions in a virtual environment. This aspect is one of the important contributions of this paper. MBSE is based on three important core pillar which is 1) Methods/Processes, 2) Language and 3) Systems. The purpose of the new developed Munich Agile Concept Approach is to handle the complexity over the entire holistic information framework for simulation and virtualization of AGV function development from the system requirement definition process up to the test and validation of the system. Furthermore, with MAGIC there is a holistic approach and method to carry out the entire virtual development process by means of capable simulation and virtualization tools based on MAGICLOOP. The Munich Agile Concept contains six different levels which are System Requirement-, System Functional-, System Architecture-, System Validation-, System Test and the System-Usage-Level. For defining the first three-level, a graphical language called System Modelling Language (SysML) has been applied. The third chapter will apply the developed approach in an industrial Use Case which is based on simulation and virtualization of AGVs in a manufacturing environment. The last chapter will summaries the results of the applied Method. A lot of verification and testing are required robot and AGV development. ore the autonomous driving system can be deployed. However, testing in a real world will consume a lot of resources and may also bring security risks. Therefore, simulation is particularly important for autonomous driving systems.","AGV, autonomous driving, MAGIC, simulation, visualization",,,,,,,,"<Integration and Evaluation of Intra-Logistics Processes in Flexible Production Systems Based on OEE Metrics, with the Use of Computer Modelling and Simulation of AGVs, {eid: 85097906905}>, <Logistics Value: Definition, Process and Measurement, {eid: 84992963254}>, <An Intelligent Bin System for Decentrally Controlled Intralogistic Systems in Context of Industrie 4.0, {eid: 85020861585}>, <Process of Creating an Integrated Design and Manufacturing Environment as Part of the Structure of Industry 4.0, {eid: 85090387204}>, <Application of structural equation modelling to analyse the impacts of logistics services on risk perception, agility and customer service level, {eid: 85049668448}>, <Evaluation of automatic guided vehicle systems, {eid: 61349183894}>, <Automated guided vehicle systems, state-of-the-art control algorithms and techniques, {eid: 85076838197}>, <None, {eid: 0005790951}>, <The new v-model of vdi 2206 and its validation, {eid: 85084750068}>, <Munich agile mbse concept (magic), {eid: 85079797258, doi: 10.1017/dsi.2019.377}>, <None, {eid: 84954540930}>, <Implementation of Systems Modeling Laguage (SysML) in Consideration of Consens Apprach, {eid: 85053343594}>, <None, {eid: 85178508400}>, <Systems Re-Engineering - ein Beitrag zur Integration von MBSE und PLM, {eid: 85029793853}>, <Model Based Systems Engineering: Prinzipen, Anwendung, Beispiele, Erfahrung und Nutzen aus Praxissicht, {eid: 85029790421}>, <Development of a Low Powered Wireless IoT Sensor Network based on MBSE, {eid: 85059991106}>, <None, {eid: 85059972644}>, <None, {eid: 85178502514}>, <Development of an Agile Concept for MBSE for Future Digital Products through the Entire Life Cycle Management Called Munich Agile MBSE Concept (MAGIC), {eid: 85096084875}>, <Development and Application of an Integrated Approach for Parametric, {eid: 85096139979}>, <Methodological integration of parametric associative CAD systems in product lifecyle management (PLM) enviroment, {eid: 77953749143}>, <None, {eid: 85059989657}>, <None, {eid: 0003980056}>, <VERIFICATION, VALIDATION, AND CERTIFICATION OF MODELING AND SIMULATION APPLICATIONS, {eid: 1642519731}>, <Application of munich agile concept for mbse by means of automated valet parking functions and the 3d environment-data, {eid: 85096086059}>, <Mobile robot simulation framework, {eid: 85178517628}>, <Trajectory tracking control of a car-trailer system, {eid: 0031144688}>, <Travis an engineering tool to animate and validate agv-systems, {eid: 17444407181}>, <Modular open robots simulation engine: Morse, {eid: 84871690379, doi: 10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980252}>, <The new v-model of vdi 2206 and its validation, {eid: 85084750068}>, <None, {eid: 85178520894}>, <None, {eid: 85178518534}>, <Design and use paradigms for gazebo, an open-source multi-robot simulator, {eid: 14044257268, doi: 10.1109/IROS.2004.1389727}>, <Development of simulation software for mobile robot path planning within multilayer map system based on metric and topological maps, {eid: 85039919431, doi: 10.1177/1729881417743029}>, <Benchmarking motion planning algorithms: An extensible infrastructure for analysis and visualization, {eid: 85028006242, doi: 10.1109/MRA.2015.2448276}>, <Simulating real robots in vir- tual environments using nvidia’s isaac sdk, {eid: 85100131953, doi: 10.5753/svr_estendido.2019.8471}>, <None, {eid: 85015285354, doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.18282.36808}>, <None, {eid: 84938142421}>, <V-rep: A versatile and scalable robot simulation framework, {eid: 84893724133, doi: 10.1109/IROS.2013.6696520}>, <Using dependency charts to improve scenario-based testing -management of inter-scenario relationships: Depicting and managing dependencies, {eid: 20244368197}>, <None, {eid: 85178501766}>, <Scheduling charging operations of autonomous agvs in automotive in-house logistics, {eid: 85094952387}>, <None, {eid: 84958561305}>, <None, {eid: 85123848114}>, <None, {eid: 85178520709}>, <None, {eid: 85178513175}>, <None, {eid: 85129857950}>, <None, {eid: 85178515748}>, <Kinematic Model of a Four Mecanum Wheeled Mobile Robot, {eid: 84999798866, doi: 10.5120/19804-1586}>, <None, {eid: 85178501647}>",,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),,,2023-08-20,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85178512518

The literature review presented describes the current trends in systems management as a means for continuous improvement, rather than as an exercise in oversimplification of systems through reductionist strategies. This conceptualisation of holistic management of organisations is opening up pathways for best practice and emerging trends, such as through methods focused on the explicit, such as for reducing risk and increasing efficiency via model-based or simulation-based engineering, and the Digital Twin. But also through methods focused on the tacit, such as through shedding of paradigms that serve as barriers to systems management through adaptive management, standardisation of outcomes, integration structures and integrated ideation of system congruence are being used for improving results. A literature review and presentation of four case studies are provided make the case for the need and effect of managing system complexity for better results. These trends in systems thought leadership and practices in systemology open up organisational capacity to engage in enriched systems management.","continuous improvement, lean, system complexity, systems management",,,,,,,,"<Transforming the systems movement, {eid: 79251558040}>, <Complexity and consequence: Crowdsourcing project., {eid: 83455220052}>, <None, {eid: 85082562778}>, <None, {eid: 0003951439}>, <Foreword, {eid: 85079526702}>, <None, {eid: 33645653200}>, <Sense-making between and across stakeholder perspectives, {eid: 85082562275}>, <None, {eid: 0003793638}>, <None, {eid: 0003964033}>, <None, {eid: 84976576846}>, <None, {eid: 0004135008}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 0004154995}>, <Designer system of systems: A rational integrated approach of system engineering to tailored aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, aero-viscoelasticity, stability, control, geometry, materials, structures, propulsion, performance, sizing, weight, cost, {eid: 85044598861}>, <None, {eid: 84942294896}>, <None, {eid: 85075688076}>, <None, {eid: 9144256009}>, <On the perception of complexity and its implications, {eid: 85006365139}>, <MBE: Advancing engineering test and evaluation, {eid: 85082562979}>, <Preface, {eid: 85082562700}>, <None, {eid: 67650158783}>, <None, {eid: 85082562794}>, <None, {eid: 84897635923}>, <None, {eid: 85028753348}>, <None, {eid: 0003431346}>, <None, {eid: 0003894008}>, <None, {eid: 85082563125}>, <None, {eid: 0004224516}>, <None, {eid: 85082563042}>",,,Routledge,,,2020-04-02,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85041799688

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Modern machines strive to run at limit performance and dependability while their operational area and size are getting restricted. To achieve those objectives, often swift integration of custom-made subsystems is required, either actuators, sensors, electronic, or SW modules. Such a diverse suite of elements needs specific approaches and tools for fast optimization and adjustment following model-based system engineering (MBSE) and digital twinning principles. The large-scale I-MECH project was an industry-driven initiative striving to give a scientific response to those demands. The intermediate results were summarized in the authors’ previous work. The purpose of this paper is to report on final project results, namely specific performance achievements and figures based on measurable KPIs. After a brief description of key technologies, special focus is given to industrial printing technology based on a generic substrate carrier. However, it is shown that similar and consistent methodology can be applicable in many other industrial domains, such as semiconductors, healthcare robotics, machining, packaging, etc. Thus, the main merit of this survey is a holistic approach to motion control design.","Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), Computer vision, Cyber-physical systems, Digital twin, Edge computing,

Our group has developed a novel application software utilizing a digital twin patient model based on electronic health record (EHR) variables to simulate clinical trajectories during the initial 6 h of critical illness. This study aimed to assess the usability, workload, and acceptance of the digital twin application as an educational tool in critical care. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted during seven user testing sessions of the digital twin application with thirty-five first-year internal medicine residents. Qualitative data were collected using a think-aloud and semi-structured interview format, while quantitative measurements included the System Usability Scale (SUS), NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and a short survey. Results: Median SUS scores and NASA-TLX were 70 (IQR 62.5–82.5) and 29.2 (IQR 22.5–34.2), consistent with good software usability and low to moderate workload, respectively. Residents expressed interest in using the digital twin application for ICU rotations and identified five themes for software improvement: clinical fidelity, interface organization, learning experience, serious gaming, and implementation strategies. Conclusion: A digital twin application based on EHR clinical variables showed good usability and high acceptance for critical care education.","critical care, medical education, medical intensive care unit, patient safety, patient-specific modeling, simulation training",,,,,,,,"<Your health care may kill you: medical errors, {eid: 85012247058, doi: 10.3233/978-1-61499-742-9-13}>, <Outcome of adverse events and medical errors in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis, {eid: 84921407771, doi: 10.1177/1062860613514770}>, <The resident learning journey in the medical intensive care unit, {eid: 85166936391, doi: 10.34197/ats-scholar.2022-0103OC}>, <The digital twin in medicine: a key to the future of healthcare?, {eid: 85135167498, doi: 10.3389/fmed.2022.907066}>, <Digital twin in healthcare: recent updates and challenges, {eid: 85145508570, doi: 10.1177/20552076221149651}>, <Personal digital twin: a close look into the present and a step towards the future of personalised healthcare industry, {eid: 85136340221, doi: 10.3390/s22155918}>, <Next-generation, personalised, model-based critical care medicine: a state-of-the art review of in silico virtual patient models, methods, and cohorts, and how to validation them, {eid: 85042552411, doi: 10.1186/s12938-018-0455-y}>, <The artificial intelligence clinician learns optimal treatment strategies for sepsis in intensive care, {eid: 85055475795, doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0213-5}>, <Virtual patient framework for the testing of mechanical ventilation airway pressure and flow settings protocol, {eid: 85139011527, doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107146}>, <An AI based digital-twin for prioritising pneumonia patient treatment, {eid: 85138347673, doi: 10.1177/09544119221123431}>, <Development and verification of a digital twin patient model to predict specific treatment response during the first 24 hours of sepsis, {eid: 85171786118, doi: 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000249}>, <The perioperative human digital twin, {eid: 85126649096, doi: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005916}>, <Modeling of critically ill patient pathways to support intensive care delivery, {eid: 85132737756, doi: 10.1109/LRA.2022.3183253}>, <Immersive virtual reality onboarding using a digital twin for a new clinical space expansion: a novel approach to large-scale training for health care providers, {eid: 85137702153, doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2022.07.031}>, <Virtual patient simulations in health professions education: systematic review and meta-analysis by the digital health education collaboration, {eid: 85069267891, doi: 10.2196/14676}>, <A computational systems biology software platform for multiscale modeling and simulation: integrating whole-body physiology, disease biology, and molecular reaction networks, {eid: 80054718671, doi: 10.3389/fphys.2011.00004}>, <A whole-body mathematical model of Sepsis progression and treatment designed in the BioGears physiology engine, {eid: 85074631611, doi: 10.3389/fphys.2019.01321}>, <Shock management for cardio-surgical ICU patients – the golden hours, {eid: 85043412333, doi: 10.15420/cfr.2015.1.2.75}>, <Developing DELPHI expert consensus rules for a digital twin model of acute stroke care in the neuro critical care unit, {eid: 85153556637, doi: 10.1186/s12883-023-03192-9}>, <Gaining consensus on expert rule statements for acute respiratory failure digital twin patient model in intensive care unit using a Delphi method, {eid: 85176496381, doi: 10.17305/bb.2023.9344}>, <Novel representation of clinical information in the ICU: developing user interfaces which reduce information overload, {eid: 79959672429, doi: 10.4338/ACI-2009-12-CR-0027}>, <An empirical evaluation of the system usability scale, {eid: 48849113355, doi: 10.1080/10447310802205776}>, <NASA-task load index (NASA-TLX); 20 years later, {eid: 44349088702, doi: 10.1177/154193120605000909}>, <How high is high?

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sustainability and digitalization have become the main direction of transformation of enterprises. Building a digital twin platform network can provide enterprises with a comprehensive view of products, manufacture, supply chain, customer experience, and profitability, which is conducive to the construction of a sustainable business model. The purpose of this paper is to study how enterprises use digital twin platform networks to generate economic, social and environmental benefits in various dimensions and their coupling relationships. Based on the literature review, this paper constructs a five-dimensional framework of a sustainable business model, and analyses the coupling relationship between dimensions. Using Haier as a way to verify the five-dimensional framework, it explores the dynamic mechanism of the Haier digital twin platform network, constructs an integrated framework based on coupling perspective and compares it with other two home appliance enterprises. The study shows that, through the digital twin platform network, enterprises can remove the disadvantage of focusing on a single product life cycle, and form a comprehensive network, so as to promote overall sustainable upgrades. This paper draws generic strategies and digital transformation suggestions for enterprises to innovate the sustainable business model. The conclusion enriches the research on sustainable business models both theoretically and practically and provides a feasible reference for the transformation of enterprises in digital economy environment.","Coupling relationship, Digital twin platform network, Haier, Sustainable business model, Transformation mechanism",,,,,,,,"<Business Model Innovation for Sustainability: Towards a Unified Perspective for Creation of Sustainable Business Models, {eid: 85017465094}>, <Sustainable business models and the automotive industry: A commentary, {eid: 84885837082}>, <Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability, {eid: 0036206314}>, <Stakeholder relations and the persistence of corporate financial performance, {eid: 67650848425}>, <The big idea: Creating shared value, {eid: 84906331429}>, <The Competitive Advantage of Corporate Philanthropy, {eid: 27644458358}>, <Sustainable business model innovation: A review, {eid: 85049632371}>, <Life Cycle-Based Generic Business Strategies for Sustainable Business Models, {eid: 84990244985}>, <Cocreation of Value in a Platform Ecosystem!

However, the construction industry has been slow to adopt DT, lagging behind sectors such as manufacturing and medicine, where digitalization has made significant strides. Given the demonstrated benefits and potential of DT, it is crucial to increase research efforts for enhancing its application in the construction industry. To accurately identify prospective areas for future research, a comprehensive review and analysis of the status quo of relevant research is urgently needed. This study undertook a systematic literature review to understand how DT can enhance operational intelligence in the building construction industry. The findings, based on a review of pertinent literature, revealed that existing studies predominantly focused on the application of DT during the construction phase and the operation and maintenance phase. However, its potential use during the planning and design phase and the demolition and recovery phase was largely overlooked. Three main categories of key digital facilitating technologies for DT in the building construction industry have been identified: (1) data-related technologies; (2) high-fidelity modeling technologies; and (3) model-based simulation technologies. These technologies have finally culminated into an integrative framework. Furthermore, three significant research gaps in the application of DT in the building construction industry have been identified, suggesting future studies explore how to (1) centralize diverse stakeholders from a lifecycle perspective; (2) address various existing technological defects; and (3) establish a universal industry standard. This paper provides a valuable roadmap for relevant stakeholders to understand the status quo of DT application and the existing deficiencies in its full implementation, which should facilitate the efficient digitalization of the construction industry.","A lifecycle perspective, An integrative framework, Building construction industry, Digital twin, Systematic literature

This study aims to identify the prognostic value and potential target protein-coding genes (PCGs) of lncRNAs in LSCC. The LSCC datasets were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Statistical and bioinformatic methods were used to establish and evaluate the prognostic model, identify the correlation between lncRNAs and clinical characteristics, and screen for PCGs co-expressed with lncRNAs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified PCG modules associated with clinical characteristics. The expression of lncRNAs and PCGs was analyzed using our LSCC patients by RT-qPCR. LINC02154, LINC00528, SPRY4-AS1, TTTY14, LNCSRLR, and KLHL7-DT were selected to establish the prognostic model. The overall survival (OS) of low-risk patients forecasted by the model was significantly better than high-risk patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and concordance index (C-index) validated the accuracy of the prognostic model. Chi-square test showed that six lncRNAs were associated with one of the clinical characteristics, i.e., gender, clinical stage, T and N stage, respectively. WGCNA identified PCG modules associated with gender, clinical stage, T and N stage. We took the intersection of the PCG modules of WGCNA, the differentially expressed PCGs between LSCC and normal samples, and the PCGs co-expressed with six lncRNAs. The intersection PCGs survival analysis showed that four PCGs, i.e., STC2, TSPAN9, SMS, and TCEA3 affected the OS of LSCC. More importantly, the differential expression of six lncRNAs and four PCGs between LSCC and normal samples was verified by our LSCC patients. In conclusion, we successfully established a prognostic model based on six-lncRNA RiskScore and initially screened the potential target PCGs of six lncRNAs for further basic and clinical research.","bioinformatic analysis, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, long non-coding RNA, prognostic signature, WGCNA",,,,,,,,"<Molecular markers in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: towards an

Product lifecycle management plays an important role in minimizing the time required for managing engineering changes. This research aims to perform an extensive survey of the literature in this area. There is no consolidated review available in this area summarizing advances in engineering change management vis-à-vis product lifecycle management. Thus, the paper gives an overview of product lifecycle management-based thinking and change management. This review puts forward the most relevant research regarding the practices and frameworks developed for managing engineering change in an organization.

"Gkeli M. (AUID: 57191416590), Potsiou C. (AUID: 22942110900)","3D crowdsourced parametric cadastral mapping: Pathways integrating BIM/IFC, crowdsourced data and LADM",2023,Land Use Policy,1,10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106713,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106713,<National Technical University of Athens>,,"© 2023This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures.","3D cadastre, 3D modelling, BIM, Crowdsourcing, IFC, LADM",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85156251147}>, <A BIM/IFC–LADM solution aligned to the greek legislation, {eid: 85132158461}>, <Consideration on how to introduce gamification tools to enhance citizen engagement in crowdsourced cadastral surveys, {eid: 85127044891}>, <A new model for cadastral surveying using crowdsourcing, {eid: 84995459706}>, <None, {eid: 85071970709}>, <An IFC-based database schema for mapping BIM data into a 3D spatially enabled land administration database, {eid: 85099556378, doi: 10.1080/17538947.2021.1875062}>, <VGI in cadastre: a greek experiment to investigate the potential of crowd sourcing techniques in cadastral mapping, {eid: 84859464496}>, <A proposed crowdsourcing cadastral model: taking advantage of previous experience and innovative techniques, {eid: 85078871367}>, <OpenStreetMap for cadastral purposes: an application using VGI for official processes in urban areas, {eid: 84941759835}>, <None, {eid: 85156219172}>, <None, {eid: 85156273567}>, <Does coimbra need a 3d cadastre?

Besides, NTP can also be applied for load generation in simulated and emulated as well as digital twin networks (DTNs). This paper focuses on accurately predicting background traffic matrix (TM) of typical local area network (LAN) for traffic synchronization in DTN. A survey is firstly conducted on DTN, conventional model, and deep learning based NTP methods. Then, as the major contribution, a linear feature enhanced convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model based NTP method is proposed for LAN. An autoregressive unit is integrated into the ConvLSTM model to improve its linear prediction ability. In addition, this paper further optimizes the proposed model from both spatial and channel-wise dimensions. Particularly, a traffic pattern attention (TPA) block and a squeeze & excitation (SE) block are derived and added to the enhanced ConvLSTM (eConvLSTM) model. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the eConvLSTM model outperforms all the baselines. It can improve the prediction accuracy by reducing the mean square error (MSE) up to 10.6% for one-hop prediction and 16.8% for multi-hops prediction, compared to the legacy CovnLSTM model, with still satisfying the efficiency requirements. The further enhancement of the eConvLSTM model can additionally reduce the MSE about 2.1% for one-hop prediction and 4.2% for multi-hops prediction, with slightly degrading efficiency. The proposed eConvLSTM model based NTP method can play a vital role on DTN traffic synchronization.","Deep neural network, Digital twin network, LSTM, Traffic matrix, Traffic prediction",,,,,,,,"<The learning and prediction of application-level traffic data in cellular networks, {eid: 85020886810, doi: 10.1109/TWC.2017.2689772}>, <Representative use cases and key network requirements for Network 2030, {eid: 85133833639}>, <Network traffic estimation using Markov chain and incremental Gaussian mixture, {eid: 84939203387}>, <Stability analysis of RBF network-based state-dependent autoregressive model for nonlinear time series, {eid: 81155123024, doi: 10.1016/j.asoc.2011.08.055}>, <Network traffic prediction model based on auto-regressive moving average, {eid: 84897763279, doi: 10.4304/jnw.9.3.653-659}>, <Bittorrent network traffic forecasting with ARMA, {eid: 85011953086, doi: 10.5121/ijcnc.2012.4409}>, <Anomaly prediction in network traffic using adaptive Wiener filtering and ARMA modeling, {eid: 69949112041}>, <On the self-similar nature of Ethernet traffic, {eid: 0029179676, doi: 10.1145/205447.205464}>, <On the prediction of packet process in network traffic using FARIMA time-series model, {eid: 5444252846}>, <Online-SVR for short-term traffic flow prediction under typical and atypical traffic conditions, {eid: 58349104545, doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2008.07.069}>, <Mobile network traffic prediction using MLP, MLPWD, and SVM, {eid: 84994591799}>, <Recurrent neural networks and robust time series prediction, {eid: 0028401357, doi: 10.1109/72.279188}>, <Long short-term memory, {eid: 0031573117, doi: 10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735}>, <Deep architecture for traffic flow prediction: deep belief networks with multitask learning, {eid: 84907500988, doi: 10.1109/TITS.2014.2311123}>, <Densely connected convolutional networks, {eid: 85035343801}>, <PulDi-COVID: Chronic obstructive pulmonary (lung) diseases with COVID-19 classification using ensemble deep convolutional neural network from chest X-ray images to minimize severity and mortality rates, {eid: 85144056056}>, <Application of deep learning techniques in diagnosis of COVID-19 (Coronavirus): A systematic review, {eid: 85148394012}>, <Traffic matrices: Balancing measurements, inference, and modeling, {eid: 33244480149}>, <None, {eid: 85160422014}>, <Concepts of digital twin network, {eid: 85111444956}>, <A systematic network traffic emulation framework for Digital Twin Network, {eid: 85116103508}>, <A knowledge graph based construction method for Digital Twin Network, {eid: 85116117693}>, <Convoy_DTN: A security interaction engine design for Digital Twin Network, {eid: 85126117944}>, <A Digital Twin Network for Security Training in 5G Industrial Environments, {eid: 85116104675}>, <Data-driven routing: A typical application of Digital Twin Network, {eid: 85116123904}>, <Traffic matrix prediction and estimation based on deep learning in large-scale IP backbone networks, {eid: 84994681224, doi: 10.1016/j.jnca.2016.10.006}>, <None, {eid: 85058828938}>, <Spatial-temporal attention-convolution network for citywide cellular traffic prediction, {eid: 85096172212, doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3012279}>, <Stock market prediction using LSTM recurrent neural network, {eid: 85085543372, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.049}>, <Short-term residential load forecasting based on LSTM recurrent neural network, {eid: 85030636120, doi: 10.1109/TSG.2017.2753802}>, <Recurrent neural network-based prediction of tcp transmission states from passive measurements, {eid: 85059973797}>, <Network traffic prediction in industrial Internet of Things backbone networks: a multitask learning mechanism, {eid: 85099560833, doi: 10.1109/TII.2021.3050041}>, <Traffic prediction based on random connectivity in deep learning with long short-term memory, {eid: 85064888832}>, <A study of deep learning networks on mobile traffic forecasting, {eid: 85045239743}>, <Convolutional LSTM network: A machine learning approach for precipitation nowcasting, {eid: 84965121965}>, <Pedestrian trajectory prediction based on deep convolutional LSTM network, {eid: 85107453760, doi: 10.1109/TITS.2020.2981118}>, <On the use of ON/OFF traffic models for spatio-temporal analysis of wireless networks, {eid: 85068833873, doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2917681}>, <Temporal convolutional networks: A unified approach to action segmentation, {eid: 85050915977}>, <PredRNN: a recurrent neural network for spatiotemporal predictive learning, {eid: 85127734010, doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3165153}>, <Multi-level attention networks for multi-step citywide passenger demands prediction, {eid: 85098946951}>",,,Springer,,,2023-09-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85160445078

This paper presents condition monitoring of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition monitoring, data-based schemes and model-based approaches, and the digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model-based approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical-based model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages, disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a drivetrain it is found that multi-body simulation is advised for the creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy, however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro-Ro (roll onroll off) vessels.

Maleika W. (AUID: 50861495300),Local Polynomial Interpolation Method Optimization in the Process of Digital Terrain Model Creation Based on Data Collected From a Multibeam Echosounder,2024,IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering,0,10.1109/JOE.2024.3353271,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2024.3353271,"<West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology>",,"© 2024 IEEE.This article describes a local polynomial interpolation (LPI) optimization used to create digital terrain models (DTM) of the seabed based on data collected via a multibeam echosounder (MBES) during a sea survey. In the studies presented in this article, the optimal parameters of this interpolation are sought in terms of the accuracy of the created models and the calculation time. The parameters to be optimized are: the size of the area from which we select the points for interpolation (radius size), the number of points involved in the local interpolation (no), and the polynomial degree used in the interpolation (poly degree). Based on the obtained results, it was shown that the optimal values of these parameters can be selected for this type of input data, and their value depends mainly on grid resolution and the density of measurement points collected during the sea survey. Based on research using various test surfaces, it has been shown that the use of properly selected interpolation parameters enables the creation of models with slightly higher accuracy. During the research, attention was also paid to the speed of calculations, which is an important aspect of the process of creating bathymetric models. It was assumed that the new method should not significantly increase the calculation time. Finally, the author proposed using a new point selection technique (named the growing radius) during LPI, which made it possible to further increase the accuracy of the created models and the speed of calculations. The results obtained are compared with other commonly used interpolation methods using the same test data, showing the good and the bad features of the optimized LPI method. The final results of the research and the conclusions presented in this article indicate that the use of the optimized LPI together with the new technique of selecting points (the growing radius) can be a better alternative to other interpolation methods used in the process of creating bathymetric models based on data from MBES.","Digital bathymetric models, digital terrain models (DTM) creation, GIS systems, local polynomial interpolation (LPI), multibeam echosounder (MBES)",,,,,,,,"<Precise bathymetry as a step towards producing bathymetric electronic navigational charts for comparative (terrain reference) navigation, {eid: 85065825297, doi: 10.1017/S0373463319000377}>, <Effect of density of measurement points collected from a multibeam echosounder on the accuracy of a digital terrain model, {eid: 84858734539, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_48}>, <Analysis of methods for determining shallow waterbody depths based on images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles, {eid: 85125106575, doi: 10.3390/s22051844}>, <Interpolation methods and the accuracy of bathymetric seabed models based on multibeam echosounder data, {eid: 84858729576, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_49}>, <A tutorial guide to geostatistics: Computing and modelling variograms and kriging, {eid: 84885464902, doi: 10.1016/j.catena.2013.09.006}>, <Comparison and analysis of gridding methods of multi-beam echo sounder, {eid: 84945558050, doi: 10.1109/CCDC.2015.7162356}>, <A comparative analysis of different DEM interpolation methods, {eid: 84892830682, doi: 10.1016/j.ejrs.2013.09.001}>, <The importance of the number of points, transect location, and interpolation techniques in the analysis of bathymetric measurements, {eid: 85060909790, doi: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.070}>, <Moving average optimization in digital terrain model generation based on test multibeam echosounder data, {eid: 84925496522, doi: 10.1007/s00367-014-0389-8}>, <A multiresolution grid structure applied to seafloor shape modeling, {eid: 85044531019, doi: 10.3390/ijgi7030119}>, <Kriging method optimization for the process of DTM creation based on huge data sets obtained from MBESs, {eid: 85058472709, doi: 10.3390/geosciences8120433}>, <Inverse distance weighting method optimization in the process of digital terrain model creation based on data collected from a multibeam echosounder, {eid: 85085109327, doi: 10.1007/s12518-020-00307-6}>, <Polynomial interpolation of GPS satellite coordinates, {eid: 32544457983, doi: 10.1007/s10291-005-0018-0}>, <Multi-beam sonar image restoration using polynomial interpolation, {eid: 85044567651, doi: 10.1109/OCEANSE.2017.8084564}>, <Piecewise polynomial expression of beach profiles, {eid: 84861384390, doi: 10.2112/08-1122.1}>, <Local polynomials for data detrending and interpolation in the presence of barriers, {eid: 81555203528, doi: 10.1007/s00477-011-0488-2}>, <Polynomial surfaces interpolating arbitrary triangulations, {eid: 0037282515, doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2003.1175100}>, <Attitude reconstruction from inertial measurement: Mitigating Runge effect for dynamic applications, {eid: 85114751288, doi: 10.1109/TAES.2021.3111839}>, <Objective analysis of meteorological fields, {eid: 0003497202}>, <None, {eid: 85199135088}>, <Local polynomial interpolation in a rectangle, {eid: 51249163625, doi: 10.1007/BF02575880}>, <Principles of local polynomial interpolation, {eid: 69949083462, doi: 10.1109/AIPR.2008.4906463}>, <None, {eid: 85199207057}>, <Graph-based depth denoising & dequantization for point cloud enhancement, {eid: 85141521767, doi: 10.1109/TIP.2022.3214077}>, <Multibeam echosounder simulator applying noise generator for the purpose of sea bottom visualisation, {eid: 80052994118, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-24088-1_30}>, <Cinebench R20 - A real world cross-platform test suite, {eid: 85199136776}>, <Development of a method for the estimation of multibeam echosounder measurement accuracy, {eid: 84870990441}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2024-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85188518297

Drought indices are utilized worldwide for drought management and monitoring. However, as a result of the inherent complexity of drought phenomena and hydroclimatic condition differences, no universal drought index is available for effectively monitoring drought across the world. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new meteorological drought index to describe and forecast drought based on various artificial intelligence (AI) models: decision tree (DT), generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine, artificial neural network, deep learning, and random forest. A comparative assessment was conducted between the developed AI-based indices and nine conventional drought indices based on their correlations with multiple drought indicators. Historical records of five drought indicators, namely runoff, along with deep, lower, root, and upper soil moisture, were utilized to evaluate the models’ performance. Different combinations of climatic datasets from Alice Springs, Australia, were utilized to develop and train the AI models. The results demonstrated that the rainfall anomaly drought index was the best conventional drought index, scoring the highest correlation (0.718) with the upper soil moisture. The highest correlation between the new and conventional indices was found between the DT-based index and the rainfall anomaly index at a value of 0.97, whereas the lowest correlation was 0.57 between the GLM and the Palmer drought severity index. The GLM-based index achieved the best performance according to its high correlations with conventional drought indicators, e.g., a correlation coefficient of 0.78 with the upper soil moisture. Overall, the developed AI-based drought indices outperformed the conventional indices, hence contributing effectively to more accurate drought forecasting and monitoring. The findings emphasized that AI can be a promising and reliable prediction approach for achieving better drought assessment and mitigation.","Drought indicators, Drought indices, Forecasting,

All rights reserved.Objective To explore classification models for radiosensitive lipid metabolites in human peripheral blood by combining lipidomics with multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods Totally 97 peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 leukemia cases admitted to a general hospital in Beijing from March to September 2023 who were ready to undergo bone marrow transplantation, including 0 Gy blood samples before irradiation in the control group (n = 24), and 73 blood samples after irradiation at doses of 4, 8 and 12 Gy in the radiation group (n = 73), and the targeted lipidomic based on the ultra - high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) platform method to analyze the differences of different lipids between control and radiation groups. Then, lipids responsive to radiation doses of 0 - 12 Gy were identified using linear regression. Finally, classification models were constructed using five ML algorithms based on the training set, followed by the validation and evaluation of these models using the validation set. Results Compared with the control group, the differences in the concentration changes of 62 lipids in 9 classes of lipid metabolites sensitive to radiation group were statistically significant (t = - 4. 91 to 4. 74, P < 0. 05), including sphingomyelins (SMs), cholesteryl esters(CEs), ceramides (Cers), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), hexosylceramides (HexCers), lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCOs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LysoPEs) . Twenty lipids responsive to radiation doses of 0 - 12 Gy were identified, namely 11 SMs, 7 CEs, 1 Cer, and 1 PI. The five models based on ML algorithms of decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), light gradient boosting machine (Light GBM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) all exhibited high goodness of fit (F1 = 0. 69-1. 00) and high sensitivity. The evaluation and validation metrics revealed that the RF-based model yielded the optimal radiation classification discrimination (sensitivity: 1. 00; accuracy: 0. 72; F1 score: 0. 80) . Conclusions Lipid metabolites responsive to radiation and lipids responsive to radiation dose in human samples were identified using targeted lipidomics. The RF-based model can provide new ideas for exploring models of human radiosensitive lipid metabolites.","Ionizing radiation, Lipidomics, Machine learning, Random forest",,,,,,,,"<Developing gender-specific gene expression biodosimetry using a panel of radiation-responsive genes for determining radiation dose in human peripheral blood J, {eid: 85072994606, doi: 10.1667/RR15355.1}>, <Identification of the differentially expressed protein biomarkers in rat blood plasma in response to gamma irradiation J, {eid: 85082331540, doi: 10.1080/09553002.2020.1739775}>, <Overview of the principles and practice of biodosimetry J, {eid: 84902544121, doi: 10.1007/s00411-014-0522-0}>, <Overview of systems biology and omics technologies J, {eid: 85006721987, doi: 10.2174/0929867323666160926150617}>, <Network approaches to systems biology analysis of complex disease: integrative methods for multi-omics data J, {eid: 85057257442, doi: 10.1093/bib/bbx066}>, <Analysis of the metabolic characteristics in rat plasma after total body irradiation J, {eid: 85110399610, doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-5098.2021.06.001}>, <Effect of circular RNA hsa _ circZDHHC21 _ 004 on the proliferation of the human small intestinal epithelial cells HIEC-6 exposed to60Co γ-rays J, {eid: 85198183104, doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112271-20230104-00002}>, <Artificial intelligence and machine learning in clinical medicine, 2023 J, {eid: 85151313164, doi: 10.1056/NEJMra2302038}>, <Differentiation between immune checkpoint inhibitor-related and radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer by CT radiomics and machine learning J, {eid: 85123700457, doi: 10.1002/mp.15451}>, <Chinese radiation intestinal injury research group. development and validation of a post-radiotherapy prediction model for bowel dysfunction after rectal cancer resection J, {eid: 85174010452, doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2023.08.022}>, <Identification of potential radiation responsive metabolic biomarkers in plasma of rats exposed to different doses of cobalt-60 gamma rays J, {eid: 85097600217, doi: 10.1177/1559325820979570}>, <Screening of lipids for early triage and dose estimation after acute radiation exposure in rat plasma based on targeted lipidomics analysis J, {eid: 85096519905, doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00560}>, <Enhancement of acylcarnitine levels in small intestine of abdominal irradiation rats might relate to fatty acid β-oxidation pathway disequilibration J, {eid: 85125865868, doi: 10.1177/15593258221075118}>, <Distinct lipid profiles of radiation-induced carotid plaques from atherosclerotic carotid plaques revealed by UPLC-QTOF-MS and DESI-MSI J, {eid: 85121680514, doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2021.12.006}>, <Plasma metabolite biomarkers predictive of radiation induced cardiotoxicity J, {eid: 85083836911, doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.018}>, <Artificial intelligence in radiology J, {eid: 85047143820, doi: 10.1038/s41568-018-0016-5}>",,,Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd,,,2024-06-25,,chi,Journal,2-s2.0-85198179655

Non-invasive techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) need to be further developed for liver fibrosis staging. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Gadolinium Ethoxybenzyl Diethylenetriamine Penta-acetic Acid (Gd-EOBDTPA)- enhanced MRI for liver fibrosis through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This study comprehensively searched relevant article in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library published from 2004 to 2018 to find studies analyzing the diagnostic accuracy of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI for liver fibrosis. Two reviewers independently screened the retrieved articles, extracted the required data from the included studies, and evaluated the methodological quality of the studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics (SROC) curve were assessed. RESULTS: This study finally included 16 studies (n = 1,599) and selected a random-effects model based on the results of the I2 statistic to combine them. The areas under the SROC curve for the detection of F1 or greater, F2 or greater, F3 or greater, or F4 liver fibrosis were 0.8669, 0.8399, 0.8481, and 0.8858, respectively. CONCLUSION: Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed a good diagnostic performance for staging liver fibrosis, especially for F4 liver fibrosis.","contrast media, gadolinium ethoxybenzyl DTPA., liver cirrhosis, liver diseases, magnetic resonance imaging, Radiology",,,,,,,,None,,,NLM (Medline),,,2021-01-01,33256584,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85114753410

All rights reserved.With the dramatic increase in the scales of e-commerce livestreaming the number of e-commerce livestreaming users has reached 48. 8% of the overall Internet users in China. The huge supply demand requires live e-commerce stores to improve their dispatching efficiency and reduce inventory. Therefore in order to avoid retailers' profit loss it is necessary to find a more accurate method to predict livestreaming sales. The sales prediction methods mainly include traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. Due to the instability of livestreaming sales and the large number of influencing factors traditional statistical methods often fail to predict the sales accurately. To complete the index system of livestreaming sales prediction and improve the accuracy of livestreaming sales prediction this paper adopted a variety of machine learning algorithms BP neural network decision tree DT random forest RF K-nearest neighbor KNN and support vector machine SVM analyzed the influencing factors of apparel livestreaming sales predicted apparel livestreaming sales and selected the best performing algorithms. The detailed research process is as follows. Firstly 17 influencing factors of livestreaming sales were selected through literature review and nine most important influencing factors were selected by using Spearman' s correlation coefficient combined with significance. Secondly different machine learning algorithms were used to establish clothing sales prediction models and the method of 5-fold cross-validation was adopted to initially screen out three algorithms RF KNN and SVM with high and stable model fit with R2 as an indicator. Finally the parameters of the three algorithms were optimized and then three prediction models were constructed. R2 MAE RMSE and MAPE were used as evaluation indexes and the optimal algorithms were selected by using the method of 5-fold cross-validation to test the performance of each model. The results of the study show that the multicollinearity between the nine factors number of fans of the anchor average number of viewers of the anchor in the last 30 days average pit output of the anchor in the last 30 days product price duration of product explanation historical sales of the product in the last 30 days number of fans of the brand historical sales of the brand in the last 30 days and discounts is weak and their correlation with the livestreaming sales is significant. Therefore these nine factors can be used as influencing factors in the prediction model. Among the influencing factors the correlation among product sales in the last 30 days the duration of product explanation and livestreaming sales is the highest. In the meanwhile the prediction algorithms KNN and RF perform better with R2 being greater than 0. 98 and MAPE within 30. 5% . Compared with the KNN algorithm the RF algorithm is more stable and its R2 RMSE and MAE perform better than those of the KNN algorithm. But the MAPE of the KNN algorithm is smaller than that of the RF algorithm for which the possible reason is that the KNN algorithm is more accurate in predicting low sales items and the relative error is smaller. According to the result of 5-fold cross-validation the RF algorithm is more stable compared with the KNN algorithm and the possible reason is that the KNN algorithm is more suitable for the dataset with more similar data features. Therefore RF can be used as the main prediction algorithm in practical applications to ensure the stability of the overall sales trend prediction. In predicting the sales of the same brand or the same category the similarity between the data is higher and then the KNN algorithm can be considered for prediction. This paper compares the performance of various prediction algorithms on livestreaming sales prediction optimizes the parameters and improves the accuracy of livestreaming sales prediction. The prediction results can help retailers make inventory planning adjust production schedules develop marketing strategies and provide data support for product purchasing pricing and promotion. Due to the fact that only some of the easily quantifiable influencing factors are explored in this paper and the sample distribution is limited future research can expand the scope of sample selection and further improve the predictive indicator system to achieve more accurate predictions.,"5-fold cross-validation, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), live-streaming sales forecasting, machine learning random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM)",,,,,,,,"<How to retain customers: Understanding the role of trust in live streaming commerce with a socio-technical perspective  J, {eid: 85117723772}>, <A multimodal analytics framework for product sales prediction with the reputation of anchors in live streaming e-commerce, {eid: 85174017347}>, <Third-party inventory forecasting application research of apparel supply chain based on BP neural network and grey GM (1, 1) model, {eid: 85162847326}>, <LSTM with particle swam optimization for sales forecasting  J , {eid: 85122631499}>, <Research on Clothing Live Broadcast Sales Prediction Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm Optimized BP Neural Network, {eid: 85181499706}>, <Forecasting method for fashion clothing demand based on kernel functions technology, {eid: 85199694823}>, <A two-stage prediction model based on behavior mining in livestream e-commerce, {eid: 85161073811}>, <E-pharmacy demand forecasting in the presence of promotional activities, {eid: 85199677760}>, <A hierarchical agglomerative clustering for product sales forecasting, {eid: 85170663971}>, <Influencing factors of livestream selling of fresh food based on a push-pull model: A two-stage approach combining structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN), {eid: 85138452614}>, <Retail sales forecasting based on hybrid optimal neural networks, {eid: 85162099129}>, <Gas station sales forecast based on decision tree integration model, {eid: 85097628104}>, <E-commerce product sales forecast with multi-dimensional index integration under small sample, {eid: 85101315950}>, <A comparative analysis of K-nearest neighbor, genetic, support vector machine, decision tree, and long short term memory algorithms in machine learning, {eid: 85136949902}>, <Time series forecasting of agricultural products’ sales volumes based on seasonal long short-term memory, {eid: 85096206758}>, <Prediction of popular elements of children’s wear based on BP neural network, {eid: 85158973003}>, <Garment sales forecast method based on genetic algorithm and BP neural network, {eid: 84908095687}>, <The influence of online celebrity marketing elements on the purchase intention of apparel consumers, {eid: 85065300196}>, <Online live broadcast sales forecast for clothing based on Stacking integrated learning, {eid: 85199698606}>, <The Research and Application of Clothing Sales Forecasting Model Based on AHP and BP Neural Network, {eid: 85049825857}>, <Influencer live streaming, brand identity and consumer purchasing behavior, {eid: 85199682330}>, <Research progress on quantitative forecast methods of clothing sales, {eid: 85182722938}>, <Research on Forecasting Method of Air Pollutant Concentration in Northwest Provincial Capital Cities Based on Machine Learning, {eid: 85193712618}>, <Random forests, {eid: 0035478854}>, <Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions, {eid: 84961834117}>, <Mining data with random forests: A survey and results of new tests, {eid: 77958064179}>, <Long short-term memory, {eid: 0031573117}>, <Support vector method for function approximation, regression estimation and signal processing  J , {eid: 84887252594}>, <Yarn quality prediction based on support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimization, {eid: 85199695553}>, <Prediction of total organic carbon at Rumaila oil field, Southern Iraq using conventional well logs and machine learning algorithms, {eid: 85082115033}>, <Pattern similarity-based machine learning methods for mid-term load forecasting: A comparative study, {eid: 85101858630}>, <A generalized fuzzy K-nearest neighbor regression model based on Minkowski distance, {eid: 85115685528}>, <Remarks on multi-output Gaussian process regression, {eid: 85040123192}>, <Random forest algorithm based on data integration  J, {eid: 85158975003}>, <Sales forecast based on optimized greymarkov chain, {eid: 85101776205}>, <Research on influencing factors and prediction of transportation carbon emissions in Qinghai, {eid: 85134485648}>, <An ARIMA-LSTM model for predicting volatile agricultural price series with random forest technique, {eid: 85174860541}>",,,China Silk Association,,,2024-01-01,,chi,Journal,2-s2.0-85199714883

This study aims to establish the optimal prediction model by comparing the performance of four prediction models that incorporated disease history and living habits in predicting the risk of Osteoporosis in Chongqing adults. Methods: We conduct a cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling in this study. We use a questionnaire From January 2019 to December 2019 to collect data on disease history and adults’ living habits who got dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We established the prediction models of osteoporosis in three steps. Firstly, we performed feature selection to identify risk factors related to osteoporosis. Secondly, the qualified participants were randomly divided into a training set and a test set in the ratio of 7:3. Then the prediction models of osteoporosis were established based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and combinatorial heuristic method (Genetic Algorithm - Decision Tree (GA-DT)). Finally, we compared the prediction models’ performance through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to select the optimal prediction model. Results: The univariate logistic model found that taking calcium tablet (odds ratio [OR] = 0.431), SBP (OR = 1.010), fracture (OR = 1.796), coronary heart disease (OR = 4.299), drinking alcohol (OR = 1.835), physical exercise (OR = 0.747) and other factors were related to the risk of osteoporosis. The AUCs of the training set and test set of the prediction models based on ANN, DBN, SVM and GA-DT were 0.901, 0.762; 0.622, 0.618; 0.698, 0.627; 0.744, 0.724, respectively. After evaluating four prediction models’ performance, we selected a three-layer back propagation neural network (BPNN) with 18, 4, and 1 neuron in the input layer, hidden and output layers respectively, as the optimal prediction model. When the probability was greater than 0.330, osteoporosis would occur. Conclusions: Compared with DBN, SVM and GA-DT, the established ANN model had the best prediction ability and can be used to predict the risk of osteoporosis in physical examination of the Chongqing population. The model needs to be further improved through large sample research.","Artificial neural network, Disease history, Living habits, Osteoporosis, Physical examination, Prediction model",,,,,,,,"<How to manage osteoporosis before the age of 50, {eid: 85084809484, doi: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.05.004}>, <Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnosis of osteoporosis, {eid: 31444443689, doi: 10.1016/j.ajog.2005.08.047}>, <Regulating life-style & improving living habits can control Osteoporosis, {eid: 85107214462}>, <Genome-wide association study of extreme high bone mass: contribution of common genetic variation to extreme BMD phenotypes and potential novel BMD-associated genes, {eid: 85048726810, doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2018.06.001}>, <An artificial neural network to predict resting energy expenditure in obesity, {eid: 85028799527}>, <Application of an artificial neural network in the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, {eid: 85078889664}>, <Low bone mineral density and its predictors in type 1 diabetic patients evaluated by the classic statistics and artificial neural network analysis, {eid: 84860806361, doi: 10.2337/dc11-0764}>, <Prediction model of artificial neural network for the risk of hyperuricemia incorporating dietary risk factors in a Chinese adult study, {eid: 85078903667}>, <Osteoporosis and osteopenia among patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥50: role of sex and clinical characteristics, {eid: 85065464855, doi: 10.1016/j.jocd.2019.04.004}>, <None, {eid: 0003911968}>, <Environmental determinants of physical activity and sedentary behavior, {eid: 0034304466}>, <A study on physical fitness of professional young and middle-aged women with mental or manual labour, {eid: 85107188695}>, <Analysis of meal patterns with the use of supervised data mining techniques - artificial neural networks and decision trees, {eid: 57449104411, doi: 10.3945/ajcn.2008.26619}>, <Development and validation of a Risk calculator predicting postoperative respiratory failure, {eid: 81055141262, doi: 10.1378/chest.11-0466}>, <Sharkey Scott P, {eid: 85107201855}>, <Introduction to ROC analysis, {eid: 33646023117, doi: 10.1016/j.patrec.2005.10.010}>, <Modelling the prevalence of diabetes mellitus risk factors based on artificial neural network and multiple regression, {eid: 85055080856}>, <An artificial neural network to predict resting energy expenditure in obesity, {eid: 85028799527, doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2017.07.017}>, <Application of three statistical models in predicting the Risk of diabetes individuals, {eid: 85077627365}>, <Alcohol consumption, physical activity, and chronic disease risk factors: a population-based cross-sectional survey, {eid: 33745119424, doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-6-118}>, <Artificial neural networks in medical diagnosis, {eid: 84874221936, doi: 10.2478/v10136-012-0031-x}>, <Development and validation of an artificial neural network prognostic model after gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma: an international multicenter cohort study, {eid: 85087890152, doi: 10.1002/cam4.3245}>, <An artificial neural network prediction model of congenital heart disease based on risk factors: a hospital-based case-control study, {eid: 85013978474, doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000006090}>, <Assessment of risk based on variant pathways and establishment of an artificial neural network model of thyroid cancer, {eid: 85066403314, doi: 10.1186/s12881-019-0829-4}>, <A comparative study on the prediction of the BP artificial neural network model and the ARIMA model in the incidence of AIDS, {eid: 85087473835, doi: 10.1186/s12911-020-01157-3}>, <Application of an artificial neural network in the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia, {eid: 84861006385}>, <None, {eid: 0001307907}>, <Osteoporosis among household women: a growing but neglected phenomenon, {eid: 85040354622, doi: 10.1016/j.mjafi.2016.09.007}>, <Aging and osteoporosis, {eid: 85107193791}>, <Low height and low weight correlates better with osteoporosis than low body mass index in postmenopausal women, {eid: 78651591289, doi: 10.1016/j.ics.2004.05.041}>, <Clinical evaluation for osteoporosis, {eid: 0037406814, doi: 10.1016/S0749-0690(02)00068-X}>, <Integrating a gender dimension into Osteoporosis and fracture Risk research, {eid: 37449017137, doi: 10.1016/S1550-8579(07)80055-6}>, <Diabetes mellitus a risk for osteoporosis?, {eid: 0034972050, doi: 10.1055/s-2001-18605}>, <None, {eid: 85107183642}>, <Smoking is a Risk factor for Osteoporosis in women with inflammatory bowel disease, {eid: 0029869139, doi: 10.3109/00365529609006412}>, <Smoking and alcohol abuse as risk factors causing low-energy fractures in males suffering from primary Osteoporosis, {eid: 85092061837}>, <Effects of smoking habit change on hospitalized fractures: a retrospective cohort study in a male population, {eid: 85080115535, doi: 10.1007/s11657-020-0686-y}>",,,BioMed Central Ltd,,,2021-12-01,34039329,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85106925411

Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Background: Skin self-examination (SSE) is widely promoted for the detection of suspicious pigmented lesions. However, determining screening accuracy is essential to appraising the usefulness of SSE. Objectives: The aim of this work was to pool estimates from studies of SSE diagnostic accuracy in the detection of suspicious pigmented lesions. Methods: This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021246356) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA-DTA guidelines. A systematic search of Medline (PubMed) EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library was conducted to identify relevant studies. We included studies that examined the accuracy of SSE, either whole-body or site-specific, for detecting change in individual pigmented lesions or detecting an atypical naevus. A univariate random-effects model, based on logit-transformed data, was used to calculate a summary diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) as well as pooled sensitivity and specificity. Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic were calculated to assess heterogeneity. A proportional hazards model was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and plot the summary receiver operator characteristic curve. We used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool to grade study quality. Results: We identified 757 studies, of which 3 met inclusion criteria for quantitative synthesis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity based on 553 included participants was 59 and 82%, respectively. The summary DOR was 5.88 and the AUC was 0.71.

Starting from a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)-derived DTM of an urban area, four digital terrain representations (raw data, building footprints filled, buildings as waterproof blocks, and different elevation data merged) are used to generate a computational mesh to run a 2D flood model for three inundation scenarios, differing in flood volumes. The most detailed DTM is obtained by merging the DTM with elevation points based on a two-step optimal interpolation algorithm. A flood damage model based on stage-damage curves is used to estimate monetary losses to structures at the building scale. Flood maps and flood losses are then compared for each terrain representation. The application of the method to an Italian urban district shows that (a) a significant mismatch between manually surveyed elevation points and DTM can be observed, (b) different sources of elevation data can be merged to obtain an optimal representation of the terrain, (c) in dense urban settlements, important differences in flood extent and losses (up to 180%) occur depending on terrain representation. Considerations on time effort required by the increasing detail of the DTM and on the transferability of the results are presented.","DTM, flood risk, interpolation methods, LiDAR, sensitivity",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85064507724}>, <Quantification of flood risk mitigation benefits: A building-scale damage assessment through the RASOR platform, {eid: 85034061121}>, <Sources of uncertainty in flood inundation maps, {eid: 68949214436}>, <None, {eid: 84905537435}>, <Integrating remote sensing data with flood inundation models: How far have we got?, {eid: 84864320846}>, <Comparing various methods of building representation for 2D flood modelling in built-up areas, {eid: 84920706369}>, <Accounting digital elevation uncertainty for flood consequence assessment, {eid: 85013408598}>, <Flood damage analysis: First floor elevation uncertainty resulting from LiDAR-derived digital surface models, {eid: 84979657078}>, <About the influence of elevation model quality and small-scale damage functions on flood damage estimation, {eid: 84876699758}>, <Modeling storm surge flooding of an urban area with particular reference to modeling uncertainties: A case study of Canvey Island, United Kingdom, {eid: 34547196330}>, <Influence of urban pattern on inundation flow in floodplains of lowland rivers, {eid: 85036617810}>, <Effect of topographic data, geometric configuration and modeling approach on flood inundation mapping, {eid: 70349485393}>, <Effect of uncertainty in land use, damage models and inundation depth on flood damage estimates, {eid: 79958792545}>, <None, {eid: 85064521966}>, <Benefit-cost analysis of disaster mitigation: Application as a policy and decision-making tool, {eid: 25444446808}>, <Quantification of flash flood economic risk using ultra-detailed stage–damage functions and 2-D hydraulic models, {eid: 84964355728}>, <Analyzing the sensitivity of a flood risk assessment model towards its input data, {eid: 85002666920}>, <None, {eid: 84889852674}>, <None, {eid: 85064508354}>, <Uncertainties in flood risk mapping: A case study on estimating building damages for a river flood in Finland, {eid: 77956098335}>, <Sensitivity of flood damage estimation to spatial resolution, {eid: 84951334914}>, <Spatial resolution considerations for urban hydrological modelling, {eid: 84897406117}>, <Sensitivity analysis of flood damage estimates: A case study in Fredericton, New Brunswick, {eid: 84962081674}>, <Reviewing estimates of the economic efficiency of disaster risk management: Opportunities and limitations of using risk-based cost–benefit analysis, {eid: 84960462047}>, <Review article “assessment of economic flood damage”, {eid: 77955916229}>, <None, {eid: 85041635940}>, <RASOR project: Rapid analysis and Spatialisation of Risk, from Hazard to risk using EO data, {eid: 85027032379}>, <Ranking sources of uncertainty in flood damage modelling: A case study on the cost-benefit analysis of a flood mitigation project in the Orb Delta, France, {eid: 84929718527}>, <Evaluation of on-line DEMs for flood inundation modelling, {eid: 34248225364}>, <Integral formulation of shallow-water equations with anisotropic porosity for urban flood modeling, {eid: 54049155416}>, <Building treatments for urban flood inundation models and implications for predictive skill and modeling efficiency, {eid: 84860629874}>, <Towards high resolution and cost-effective terrain mapping for urban hydrodynamic modelling in densely settled river-corridors, {eid: 84949266619}>, <Does mitigation save?

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures.","Cyber-physical production, Digital manufacturing system, Digital shadow, Digital twin,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Computer vision has shown potential for assisting post-earthquake inspection of buildings through automatic damage detection in images. However, assessing the safety of an earthquake-damaged building requires considering this damage in the context of its global impact on the structural system. Thus, an inspection must consider the expected damage progression of the associated component and the component’s contribution to structural system performance. To address this issue, a digital twin framework is proposed for post-earthquake building evaluation that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, component identification, and damage evaluation using a Building Information Model (BIM) as a reference platform. The BIM guides selection of optimal sets of images for each building component. Then, if damage is identified, each image pixel is assigned to a specific BIM component, using a GrabCut-based segmentation method. In addition, 3D point cloud change detection is employed to identify nonstructural damage and associate that damage with specific BIM components. Two example applications are presented. The first develops a digital twin for an existing reinforced concrete moment frame building and demonstrates BIM-guided image selection and component identification. The second uses a synthetic graphics environment to demonstrate 3D point cloud change detection for identifying damaged nonstructural masonry walls. In both examples, observed damage is tied to BIM components, enabling damage to be considered in the context of each component’s known design and expected earthquake performance. The goal of this framework is to combine component-wise damage estimates with a pre-earthquake structural analysis of the building to predict a building’s post-earthquake safety based on an external UAV survey.","Automated inspection, Building information modeling, Computer vision, Digital twin, Post-earthquake evaluation, Unmanned aerial vehicles",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0007820039}>, <None, {eid:

To meet the resulting challenges, digital technologies are a key component in the context of competitive battery cell manufacturing. For a requirements-oriented implementation of an appropriate Industry 4.0 environment, three Digital Twins are implemented to meet the digital needs in the battery cell manufacturing environment: The Product Twin, the Plant Twin, and the Building Twin. Addressing the challenges of battery cell manufacturing requires holistic Digital Twins that encompass the entire lifecycle. Existing Maturity Models do not provide a sufficient basis for a systematic assessment and holistic development of the Product-, the Plant-, and the Building Twin in battery cell manufacturing. Therefore, a novel Maturity Model considering the specific requirements has been developed. The Maturity Model is developed using an action model based on the Design Science Research methodology. The content components are carried out with qualitative empiricism - literature review, expert workshops, expert interviews - within five iterations. This is followed by expert evaluation of the model using a case study. The result of the empiricism is a holistic Maturity Assessment Model for Digital Twins in Battery Cell Industry. The Maturity Model includes five maturity levels, twelve maturity dimensions, 50 maturity sub-dimensions and 250 maturity indicators. Fuzzy Logic is used to perform the quantitative maturity assessments of the Digital Twins by means of the maturity indicators. The evaluation results show that the model can offer consistent and reproducible maturity assessments. Once the model has been tested and verified with further case studies it is plausible that the Maturity Model can be applied to a wide range of Digital Twins in the manufacturing industry.","Battery Cell Manufacturing, Digital Twins, Fuzzy Logic, Industry 4.0, Maturity Models",,,,,,,,"<About The Importance of Autonomy and Digital Twins for the Future of Manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.06.141}>, <Digital twin-based sustainable intelligent manufacturing: a review, {eid: 85083639816, doi: 10.1007/s40436-020-00302-5}>, <None, {eid: 84988675630, doi: 10.31030/2436156}>, <Interaction of Digital Twins in a Sustainable Battery Cell Production, {eid: 85132265302, doi: 10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.134}>, <Product lifecycle management: the new paradigm for enterprises, {eid: 34047222275}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943, doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.26367.61609}>, <The Digital Twin Paradigm for Future NASA and U.S. Air Force Vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <DRAFT Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology & Processing Roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <Digital twin - Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953499}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2018.04.055}>, <State of the Art and Future Directions of Digital Twins for Production Logistics: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85122746801, doi: 10.3390/app12020669}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) in Industry 4.0: An Architecture Reference Model, {eid: 85097743225, doi: 10.1016/j.aei.2020.101225}>, <A Taxonomy of Digital Twins, {eid: 85089398895}>, <Towards a semantic Construction Digital Twin: Directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <Der Digitale Zwilling in der Batteriezellfertigung, {eid: 85184573778, doi: 10.24406/publica-496}>, <Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers, {eid: 0000406753, doi: 10.1002/asi.5090140103}>, <COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND CHEMICAL EDUCATION, {eid: 0001063068, doi: 10.1126/science.66.1713.385}>, <System of document connection based on references (in Russian), {eid: 4243116799}>, <Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents, {eid: 0015640298, doi: 10.1002/asi.4630240406}>, <Entwicklung von Reifegradmodellen für das IT-Management, {eid: 84856394491, doi: 10.1007/s11576-009-0167-9}>, <Design Science in Information Systems Research, {eid: 0242652022, doi: 10.2307/25148625}>, <Maturity Models in Information Systems: A Review and Extension of Existing Guidelines, {eid: 85184602033}>, <Understanding the Main Phases of Developing a Maturity Assessment Model, {eid: 84869135773}>, <The use of maturity models/grids as a tool in assessing product development capability, {eid: 0036440472, doi: 10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038431}>, <Gemini Principles-Based Digital Twin Maturity Model for Asset Management, {eid: 85111662076, doi: 10.3390/su13158224}>, <An Off-Site Construction Digital Twin Assessment Framework Using Wood Panelized Construction as a Case Study, {eid: 85129988316, doi: 10.3390/buildings12050566}>, <None, {eid: 0003748765}>, <Entwicklung eines Reifegradmodells zur Bewertung Entwicklung eines Reifegradmodells zur Bewertung des Digitalisierungsgrades von Geschäftsprozessen, {eid: 85145651792}>, <Digital Twins: A Maturity Model for Their Classification and Evaluation, {eid: 85133780403, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3186353}>, <None, {eid: 85184571821}>, <Fuzzy sets, {eid: 34248666540, doi: 10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X}>, <The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and its Application to Approximate Reasoning I, {eid: 0016458950, doi: 10.1016/0020-0255(75)90036-5}>, <The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and its Application to Approximate Reasoning II, {eid: 0016459349, doi: 10.1016/0020-0255(75)90046-8}>, <The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and its Application to Approximate Reasoning III, {eid: 0016631726, doi: 10.1016/0020-0255(75)90017-1}>, <None, {eid: 0003909811}>, <Fuzzy-Bildverarbeitung, {eid: 0343059599}>, <Einführung in die Fuzzy-Logik, {eid: 0042181454}>, <Making sense of Cronbachs alpha, {eid: 85028506646, doi: 10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd}>, <Ökonomische Planung von Prozessverbesserungsmaßnahmen - Ein modelltheoretischer Ansatz auf Grundlage CMMI-basierter Prozessreifegradmodelle, {eid: 85184611271}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2023-10-24,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85184595832

However, a challenge persists in the form of low usage rates and acceptance among older adults in China. There are accumulating evidence that willingness will affect the telemedicine usage among older adults. This study investigates factors influencing older users’ trust in adopting telemedicine technology, thereby promoting actual use. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted with 400 urban seniors aged 60 and above. Drawing from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB), the author combines elements such as Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Subjective Norms, Service Environment, Self-Efficacy, Behavioral Intention to Use, and Usage Behavior. The aim is to explore the interrelationships between these factors. Results: Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Service Environment (SE) significantly and positively impact Behavioral Intention (BI) to use telemedicine, with Trust (TR) identified as a crucial mediating variable. Enhancing trust can substantially increase older adults’ intention to use telemedicine services. Furthermore, the study reveals a significant relationship between older adults’ trust in telemedicine and factors such as Perceived Usefulness (PU), Service Environment (SE), Subjective Norms (SR), as well as Emotional Risk (ER) and Cost Risk (CR), the latter two tending to decrease Trust(TR). Conclusions: This paper constructs and validates a combined model based on TAM and DTPB, comprehensively exploring the potential factors influencing the older adults’ intention to use telemedicine. The findings suggest that telemedicine services for older adults should prioritize improving user perception and enhancing trust throughout the service process to effectively increase their willingness to use these services.","Older adults, Telemedicine, Trust, Willingness to use",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0006800638}>, <None, {eid: 85204292270}>, <None, {eid: 85204302941}>, <None, {eid:

Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment.","3D kinematic modeling, GIS model, LiDAR, Machine learning, Rockfall hazard",,,,,,,,"<Rockfall Activity Index (RAI): A lidar-derived, morphology-based method for hazard assessment, {eid: 85015813400}>, <Rockfall Hazard Assessment: An Overview, {eid: 85044097103}>, <Laser Scanning Systems and Techniques in Rockfall Source Identification and Risk Assessment: A Critical Review, {eid: 85046676656}>, <Application of LiDAR in Rockfall Hazard Assessment in Tropical Region, {eid: 85044063442}>, <Reducing Landslide Risk Using Airborne Lidar Scanning Data, {eid: 85067410936}>, <A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning-Based Model for Rockfall Source Identification in Presence of Other Landslide Types Using LiDAR and GIS, {eid: 85072038202}>, <Automated 3D Jointed Rock Mass Structural Analysis and Characterization Using LiDAR Terrestrial Laser Scanner for Rockfall Susceptibility Assessment: Perissa Area Case (Santorini), {eid: 85078495964}>, <Rockfall source characterization at high rock walls in complex geological settings by photogrammetry structural analysis and DFN techniques, {eid: 85052801589}>, <A hybrid model using machine learning methods and GIS for potential rockfall source identification from airborne laser scanning data, {eid: 85045443088}>, <None, {eid: 85086459767}>, <Rockfall trajectory modeling combined with heuristic analysis for assessing the rockfall hazard along the Maratea SS18 coastal road (Basilicata, Southern Italy), {eid: 84949496660}>, <UAV-based mapping, back analysis and trajectory modeling of a coseismic rockfall in Lefkada island, Greece, {eid: 85041199819}>, <A novel rockfall hazard assessment using laser scanning data and 3D modelling in GIS, {eid: 85053033474}>, <Qualitative evolving rockfall hazard assessment for highwalls, {eid: 85030560600}>, <Description of a GIS-based rockfall hazard assessment methodology and its application in mountainous sites, {eid: 85070087159}>, <Quantitative rockfall risk assessment for an important road by means of the rockfall risk management (RO.

This degradation leads to high maintenance costs and possibly traffic disturbances. There is therefore a demand from infrastructure managers to monitor the condition and predict maintenance needs for these assets without the need for regular on-site inspections. One solution for operational condition monitoring is to observe the structural response of the crossing under traffic loading via embedded accelerometers. From these measurements, relative changes in track dynamics over time can be observed. To derive a condition or predict maintenance needs, however, these measured accelerations need to be related to the status of the asset. A framework for this where measurement data, simulation models and maintenance history are combined to build an online model that can assess the status and predict future maintenance needs for a material asset is often called a Digital Twin. This paper will present a Digital Twin framework that uses measured accelerations, climate data, scanned running surface geometry and a multi-body simulation (MBS) model to estimate the status and degradation rate of crossing panels. Method developments for this framework are demonstrated for two in situ crossings.","Condition monitoring, Crossing panel, Digital Twin demonstrator, Multi-body simulations",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84973611512}>, <None, {eid: 84905464697}>, <In2Track, Deliverable 2.2: Enhanced S&C whole system analysis, design and virtual validation, {eid: 85136983984}>, <None, {eid: 85136992650}>, <On tailored signal processing tools for operational condition monitoring of railway switches and crossings, {eid: 85105825913}>, <A parameterized turnout model for simulation of dynamic vehicle-turnout interaction with an application to crossing geometry assessment, {eid: 85123557934}>, <3D – BLACK Series: The truly portable metrology-grade 3D scanners, {eid: 85136927428}>, <None, {eid: 85136925487}>, <Simulation of track-ground vibrations due to a high-speed train: The case of X-2000 at Ledsgård, {eid: 0037468843}>, <The effect of track and vehicle parameters on wheel/rail vertical dynamic forces, {eid: 0015990707}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,2021-08-17,,eng,Book Series,2-s2.0-85136939837

Modellers must evaluate phenology when comparing ALS-based maps of ground elevation or canopy height between years. We showcase the scenario using a National Park in the North-West of Spain where bi-temporal ALS has been used to map deciduous mountain forests. We compare the 2010 and 2021 surveys using the same algorithms to interpret ALS data and to generate actionable products for managers, mainly digital terrain models and canopy height models. We implemented a hybrid approach to correct the discrepancies between the surveys, showing the problems arising from differences in phenology or the selection of the scaling. We quantified around 5% of the area suffered from >1 m difference in DTM and higher impact on CHM values. With the hybrid method, modellers can highly reduce the uncertainty when comparing two ALS surveys and derivable products. We provided a solid graphical and analytical diagnosis of these emerging problems in the context of multi-temporal ALS surveys testing the hybrid approach at two resolutions: 1 and 2 m, fine-grained scales. The assessment of phenology-induced effects is important under the context of nationwide ALS survey programmes currently in operation and on high-demand. Finally, we discuss and frame the hybrid-approach as a well-suited vector of canopy gap detection methods to support conservation planning and enforce species-specific habitat improvements.","Forest inventory, Forest surveying, Lidar, Remote sensing, Temperate forests",,,,,,,,"<National Forest Inventory and forest observational studies in Spain: applications to forest modeling, {eid: 84893925773, doi: 10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.007}>, <Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation, {eid: 85017552006, doi: 10.1126/science.aaj1987}>, <On promoting the use of lidar systems in forest ecosystem research, {eid: 85069950324, doi: 10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117484}>, <Estimation of forest biomass dynamics in subtropical forests using multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data, {eid: 84961778404, doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.012}>, <Habitat evaluation for the Iberian wolf Canis lupus in Picos de Europa National Park, Spain, {eid: 3042524012, doi: 10.1016/j.apgeog.2004.04.003}>, <The role of remote sensing data in habitat suitability and connectivity modeling: insights from the Cantabrian Brown bear, {eid: 85103293160, doi: 10.3390/rs13061138}>, <Canopy palm cover across the Brazilian Amazon forests mapped with airborne LIDAR data and deep learning, {eid: 85134479279, doi: 10.1002/rse2.264}>, <The effect of leaf-on and leaf-off forest canopy conditions on LiDAR derived estimations of forest structural diversity, {eid: 85111106410, doi: 10.1016/j.jag.2020.102160}>, <The global ecosystem dynamics investigation: high-resolution laser ranging of the Earths forests and topography, {eid: 85166787756, doi: 10.1016/j.srs.2020.100002}>, <Species’ habitat use inferred from environmental variables at multiple scales: how much we gain from high-resolution vegetation data?, {eid: 85025578624, doi: 10.1016/j.jag.2016.10.007}>, <Accuracy assessment of the global TanDEM-X digital elevation model in a mountain environment, {eid: 85081038023, doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2020.111724}>, <Advances in remote sensing technology and implications for measuring and monitoring forest carbon stocks and change, {eid: 79959360264, doi: 10.4155/cmt.11.18}>, <Developing a site index model for P.

World Economic Forum, Davos, 2019 [29]), a question posed by Amartya Sen actuates further thought—namely that for who has to be sustained (Anand and Sen in World Dev 28:2029–2049, 2000a [4])? This question was answered by himself, proposing “it is not so much that humanity is trying to sustain the natural world but rather that humanity is trying to sustain itself (Sen in J Hum Dev Capabil 14:6–20, 2013 [66])”. Against this background, in our research we addressed this question of who has to be sustained using Sen’s capability approach for the case study of Germany. For this purpose, the German household survey (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe (EVS)) of the German Federal Statistical Office is used to analyse five social household groups (all households, single households, single parents, couples without children, couples with children) according to their income (nine income classes) (Federal Statistical Office Germany in Wirtschaftsrechnungen. Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe Einnahmen und Ausgaben privater Haushalte 2018, 2020a [19]; Federal Statistical Office Germany in Wirtschaftsrechnungen. Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe Konsumausgaben privater Haushalte 2018, 2020b [20]). Based on this survey, the question of who needs to be sustained will be analysed as follows: 1.First, the “worldwide reach (Rosa in Resonanz: Eine Soziologie der Weltbeziehung. Suhrkamp, Berlin, 2019 [62])” of the consumption patterns of the German household groups will be measured by their ecological and water footprints.2.Second, an operationalization is derived for Amartya Sen’s sustainable development definition using the food–energy–water nexus as the core of sustainable development (United Nations (UN Water) in Water, food and energy. United Nations, 2020 [73]), and to reveal botha.potential contradictions between the FEW sectors and other sectors of the German society which can negatively affect sustainable development in Germany, andb.the degree of inequality in functionings and capabilities among German households.3.Finally, those household groups will be identified which “have to be sustained” the most according to Sen’s definition. In the presented model, based on ul Haq (Fukuda-Parr in Fem Econ 9:301–317, 2003 [24]; Haq in Human development in a changing world. UNDP, New York, 1992 [30]; Haq in Reflections on human development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1995 [31]) and Sen (Anand and Sen in Human development index: methodology and measurement. Occasional papers. UNDP, New York, 1994 [3]; Sen in Ökonomie für den Menschen [Economy for the people], 2nd edn. dtv, Munch, 2003 [59]), the German capability index (GCI) is used to reveal both the capabilities and functionings of German society and the underlying justice structure of the German society. The capabilities (realization opportunities) in this context describe people’s opportunities of using their functionings (abilities) to achieve a place in society (Venkatapuram in Health justice. Polity Press, Cambridge, 2011 [81]) given their personal capabilities, while simultaneously maintaining a sustainable use of the food–energy–water resources. The aim of the German capability index (GCI) is to make the capabilities of the various German households comparable and establish the GCI as an index of revealed capabilities.","Capability approach, Food–energy–water nexus, Germany, Sustainable development",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85105542198}>, <Capabilities and achievements: An empirical study, {eid: 33144476126}>, <None, {eid: 0344972167}>, <Human development and economic sustainability, {eid: 0034531972}>, <The income component of the human development index, {eid: 85089756177}>, <None, {eid: 85105518051}>, <Viewpoint: Weak versus strong sustainability, {eid: 67650458112}>, <Strong versus weak sustainability: Economics, natural sciences, and “consilience, {eid: 0012680176}>, <Social diffusion of energy-related practices and representations: Patterns and policies in Portugal and Belgium, {eid: 84949661281}>, <Energy justice, unequal access to affordable warmth, and capability deprivation: A quantitative analysis for Belgium, {eid: 85048468201}>, <Sustainable development and the water–energy–food nexus: A perspective on livelihoods, {eid: 84939620732}>, <None, {eid: 85105528963}>, <Human development means realizing the full potential of every life, {eid: 85105429958}>, <None, {eid: 79955869673}>, <Does economic growth improve the human lot?

Reaching Net Zero depends on datafication and digitisation as data on carbon emissions collected across assets’ lifecycle are important for neutralising them. This study aims to understand how technological ecosystems such as Digital Twins – that connect physical and digital artefacts – can support a Net Zero vision in the built environment, in an industry-agnostic way to transfer any relevant lessons from other sectors. The method is a systematic literature review that structures new knowledge on the topic. The study showed that environment sustainability has been an overused idea in scientific literature, yet rarely operationalised. A scarcity of studies utilising the potential of digital twins for Net Zero was found. The emergent themes are: overreliance on technocratic solutions at the expense of systems thinking, proliferation of renewable sources and misunderstandings regarding visualisation necessity, and showing pathways for future DT system design for Net Zero.","Digital twins, model-based systems engineering, net zero, review, sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Shades of grey: Guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 84964407503}>, <Imagining construction’s digital future.

Digital Twin process workflow is proposed in case of Mohammed VI Bridge modeling in Morocco. The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure. This work presents a general vision and a justification for integrating DT technology with geospatial data. The paper examines the benefits of integrating 3D GIS data acquired by automated mobile mapping (MMS) workflows for modeling the reality of a major bridge infrastructure in Morocco. This allowed to study the future performance of this bridge structure on virtual twin structures under different environmental conditions. Cloud point data are acquired by a Mobile Mapping System on Mohammed VI Bridge and converted in BIM model by a scan to BIM process and is integrated in a GIS and BIM virtual environment and shows the efficiency of volumetric auscultation in terms of surface flatness and distortion inspection. This project provides a new bridge maintenance system using the concept of a Digital Twin. This digital model is a platform that allows to collect, organize and share the maintenance history of this important road infrastructure in Morocco.","3D model-based; Digital Twin, Bridge, Cloud point, Mobile mapping systems (MMS), Simulation, Virtual prototype, Volumetric auscultation.",,,,,,,,"<A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001}>, <How virtualization, decentralization and network building change the manufacturing landscape: An industry 4. 0 perspective, {eid: 84904464337}>, <Untangling the digital thread: The challenge and promise of model-based engineering in defense acquisition, {eid: 85032443075}>, <None, {eid: 85059806799}>, <Recent development of bridge management systems in Canada, {eid: 84898484171}>, <Development of BIM for a maintenance system of subway infrastructure, {eid: 84863150755}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <None, {eid: 85065979452}>, <What is digital twin technology-and why is it so important?, {eid: 85056624416}>, <Building Information Modeling (BIM) for existing buildings-Literature review and future needs, {eid: 84890525940}>, <Development of BIM-based bridge maintenance system for cable-stayed bridges, {eid: 85040226383}>, <3d information model based bridge maintenance, {eid: 85040223661}>, <Experimentable digital twins for model-based systems engineering and simulation-based development, {eid: 85021452617}>, <None, {eid: 85087935286}>, <Experimentable digital twins-streamlining simulation-based systems engineering for industry 4. 0, {eid: 85041837589}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins: Simulation-based development and operation of complex technical systems, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Use of mobile LiDAR in road information inventory: A review, {eid: 84976614865}>, <Review of mobile mapping and surveying technologies, {eid: 84877013699}>, <LiDAR point clouds to 3-D urban models: A review, {eid: 85041188423}>, <Digital twin models for maintenance of cadre-supported bridges, {eid: 85087977463}>, <3d digital twin models for bridge maintaine, {eid: 85087933853}>, <BIM authoring for an imagebased bridge maintenance system of existing cable-supported bridges, {eid: 85046087573}>, <Development of bim for a maintenance system of subway infrastructure, {eid: 84863150755}>, <Building Information Modeling (BIM) for existing buildings-Literature review and future needs, {eid: 84890525940}>, <None, {eid: 84891585130}>, <None, {eid: 85087985187}>, <Applications of 3d city models: State of the art review, {eid: 84952802912}>, <Building inforamtion modelling (BIM) for transportation infrastructure-Literature review, application, challenges, and recommendations, {eid: 85049913864}>, <A study on software architecture for effective BIM/GIS-based facility management data integration, {eid: 84925705205}>, <Merging BIM and GIS using ontologies application to Urban facility management in ACTIVe3D, {eid: 84908099373}>, <None, {eid: 85087943806}>, <None, {eid: 85087975118}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-05-11,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85087967317

Av. Ramón y Cajal 1>",,"© 2023 The AuthorsThe digital transformation (DT) of companies implies the emergence of new business models based on the widespread use of digital technologies. Digital transformation is necessary to improve efficiency, productivity, and market access in a context of increasing competition. In the case of the agri-food sector, DT is also required to address the challenges of food safety, food waste, and sustainability. This research aims to build a theoretical framework and a methodology to assess the global level of DT and its dimensions and factors that influence it in a specific type of agri-food company, namely agri-food cooperatives. These prominent social economy entities follow cooperative principles and play a significant role in rural development, especially in the most backward regions. An empirical analysis has been conducted to validate the methodology and meet the objectives. To this end, a Global Index of DT was built, and data was obtained from a survey of agri-food cooperatives in Andalusia, a southern Spanish region with a long-standing tradition of agri-food cooperatives, which also presents a low per-capita income in the European context. Empirical results effectively reveal that the proposed theoretical framework and methodology expediate the assessment of the global level of DT of agri-food cooperatives and the relevance of certain influential critical factors. In this way, relevant information for cooperatives and policy-makers can be collected to facilitate the implementation of DT.","Agri-food cooperatives, Digital maturity model, Digital transformation, Rural development, Theoretical framework",,,,,,,,"<Digitalization trend and its influence on the development of the operational process in production companies, {eid: 85147988586, doi: 10.3390/app13031393}>, <An integrated conceptual framework for the study of agricultural cooperatives: from repolitisation to cooperative sustainability, {eid: 85088990227, doi: 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.06.019}>, <Factors affecting the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for farming decisions, {eid: 84869006106, doi: 10.1080/10496505.2012.636980}>, <New trends in the global digital transformation process of the agri-food sector: an exploratory study based on Twitter, {eid: 85138371040, doi: 10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103520}>, <Impact of climate change on agriculture production and its sustainable solutions, {eid: 85077337937, doi: 10.1007/s42398-019-00078-w}>, <Objectives alignment between members and agricultural cooperatives, {eid: 85045624050, doi: 10.22004/ag.econ.277885}>, <None, {eid: 85179822187}>, <On the stability of the cooperative type of organization, {eid: 0000003655}>, <Comparative fit indexes in structural models, {eid: 0025397298, doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.238}>, <Explanatory factors for efficiency in the use of social networking sites—the case of organic food products, {eid: 85033211579, doi: 10.1002/mar.21052}>, <The digitalization of supply chain: a review, {eid: 85127806082, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2022.01.381}>, <Support for farmers cooperatives, case study report.

In the meantime, those techniques struggle to obtain wide adoption due to inherent learning barrier, i.e. it is considered difficult to use those methods. There is also a common difficulty in translating the specifications in natural language, a common practice nowadays, to formal specifications. In this position paper we discuss the concept of an end-to-end methodology that helps identify specifications from various sources, automatically create formal specifications and apply them to verification of cyber-physical systems. Thus, we intent to address the challenges of creation of formal specifications in an efficient automated and tool-supported manner. The novelty of the approach is analyzed through a survey of state of the art. It is currently planned to implement this concept and evaluate it with industrial case studies.","Co-simulation, Cyber-physical systems (CPS), Digital twin, Formal specification, Language processing,

All Rights Reserved.Connection, automation, sharing and electrification (CASE) are the future of vehicle and mobility systems. International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that electric vehicles including plug-in hybrid vehicles will count for 97% of the market by 2050. The increasingly stringent emission legislations for CO2 reduction, especially when involving real driving emissions (RDE) testing are the main challenges to the control system of the vehicle powertrains. This paper focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for engine control developments that follow the standard model-based routine. By reviewing state-of-the-art AI technologies for feedforward control, feedback control, and global optimization at system level, the advantage and disadvantage of the AI technologies are compared and summarized. An outlook is provided based on the literature survey. It indicates that AI will promote the fusion of technologies in three representative domains, 1) fusion of cyber systems and physical systems, e.g., digital twin of engine; 2) fusion of machine learning systems and classical control systems, e.g., AI-based calibration of engine controllers; and 3) fusion of information from multiple sources, e.g., powertrain domain control network. The technology fusions in these three domains are expected to promote the development of advanced engines which aims to achieve zero emissions.","Artificial intelligence (AI), Controller calibration,

Forest managers and technicians should include biodiversity monitoring as support for sustainible forest management and conservation issues, through the adoption of forest biodiversity indices. The present study investigates the potential of a new type of Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry derived variables for modelling forest structure indicies, which do not require the availability of a digital terrain model (DTM) such as those obtainable from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) surveys. The DTM-independent variables were calculated using raw 3D UAV photogrammetric data for modeling eight forest structure indices which are commonly used for forest biodiversity monitoring, namely: basal area (G); quadratic mean diameter (DBHmean); the standard deviation of Diameter at Breast Height (DBHσ); DBH Gini coefficient (Gini); the standard deviation of tree heights (Hσ); dominant tree height (Hdom); Lorey's height (Hl); and growing stock volume (V). The study included two mixed temperate forests areas with a different type of management, with one area, left unmanaged for the past 50 years while the other being actively managed. A total of 30 field sample plots were measured in the unmanaged forest, and 50 field plots were measured in the actively managed forest. The accuracy of UAV DTM-independent predictions was compared with a benchmark approach based on traditional explanatory variables calculated from ALS data. Finally, DTM-independent variables were used to produce wall-to-wall maps of the forest structure indices in the two test areas and to estimate the mean value and its uncertainty according to a model-assisted regression estimators. DTM-independent variables led to similar predictive accuracy in terms of root mean square error compared to ALS in both study areas for the eight structure indices (DTM-independent average RMSE% = 20.5 and ALS average RMSE% = 19.8). Moreover, we found that the model-assisted estimation, with both DTM-independet and ALS, obtained lower standar errors (SE) compared to the one obtained by model-based estimation using only field plots. Relative efficiency coefficient (RE) revealed that ALS-based estimates were, on average, more efficient (average RE ALS = 3.7) than DTM-independent, (average RE DTM-independent = 3.3). However, the RE for the DTM-independent models was consistently larger than the one from the ALS models for the DBH-related variables (i.e. G, DBHmean, and DBHσ) and for V. This highlights the potential of DTM-independent variables, which not only can be used virtually on any forests (i.e., no need of a DTM), but also can produce as precise estimates as those from ALS data for key forest structural variables and substantially improve the efficiency of forest inventories.","Airborne laser scanning, Biodiversity, Drone, DTM-independent, Forest inventory, Forest

All rights reserved.Urban 3D modeling is indispensable for digital twinning and the development of smart cities. The effective extraction of building outlines is a critical step in achieving high-precision urban modeling and 3D mapping. At present, the extraction of building outlines from airborne point cloud data still faces challenges, such as low efficiency and accuracy with conventional methods and limited calibration samples. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a deep learning method for extracting building outlines from 3D airborne point clouds. The airborne LiDAR point clouds are the primary data input. First, through vertical projection to the XOY plane, point clouds of buildings with the application of progressive morphological filtering are converted to rasterized elevation that characterizes spatial variation of terrain and visible light raster images that depict texture differences. Then, the deep learning model based on Lines-Convolutional Neural Networks (Line-CNN) is employed to preliminarily extract line features from raster images, encompassing stages of feature extraction, node prediction, route generation, and others. To enhance the quality of the primary straight-line extraction, an optimization strategy is introduced, which incorporates a range of comprehensive trimming and completion operations, aligning with information extracted from both the elevation and visible light raster images. Simultaneously, false line segments are eliminated, and missing lines are added, resulting in the regular and complete building outline features. To verify the proposed model, the airborne point cloud data from NUIST campus and the ISPRS H3D 2019 datasets are utilized in the experiment. Our results show that the proposed method accurately and comprehensively extracts building outline features from LiDAR images, achieving an impressive average accuracy and completeness rate, both up to 90%. Furthermore, the proposed method is highly efficient and effectively addresses the challenge of insufficient 3D calibration samples in traditional methods, making it suitable for various applications, particularly large-scale urban 3D modeling and cadastral surveying. To sum up, the proposed method constitutes a significant stride in advancing urban modeling and 3D mapping. It provides a novel solution to address the challenges associated with building outline extraction, particularly within the context of smart cities and digital twins. Due to the model's high accuracy, completeness, and efficiency, our method is highly helpful for a wide range of applications in the urban planning and geospatial information fields.","building contour line, colored airborne point cloud, deep learning, elevation raster image, high precision urban modeling, pruning and completion optimization, visible light raster image",,,,,,,,"<Progress, challenges and perspectives of 3D LiDAR point cloud processingJ, {eid: 85035007902, doi: 10.11947/j.AGCS.2017.20170351}>, <Automatic extraction of building rooftop outlines using airborne LiDAR: A reviewJ, {eid: 85097841537}>, <The study of the edge detection to the depth-image of light detection and rangingJ, {eid: 82655189473, doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1001-5078.2005.06.019}>, <Three-dimensional alpha shapesJ, {eid: 0028259338, doi: 10.1145/174462.156635}>, <Another efficient algorithm for convex hulls in two dimensionsJ, {eid: 0018754286, doi: 10.1016/0020-0190(79)90072-3}>, <Extraction of building contour from point clouds using dual threshold alpha shapes algorithmJ, {eid: 85090705572, doi: 10.11988/ckyyb.20160811}>, <Surface reconstruction algorithm using self-adaptive step alpha-shapeJ, {eid: 85099653727, doi: 10.16337/j.1004-9037.2019.03.012}>, <None, {eid: 85133132045}>, <Building roof boundary extraction based on airborne LiDAR dataJ, {eid: 85204955674, doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1674-9057.2019.04.011}>, <Extraction of static water boundary from airborne LiDAR point cloudJ, {eid: 85204995398, doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1000-3177.2021.03.005}>, <Discussion on water area boundary extraction method based on LiDAR dataJ, {eid: 85198032827, doi: 10.3969/j.issn.1672-4623.2022.04.017}>, <Learning to parse wireframes in images of man-made environmentsC, {eid: 85062852479, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2018.00072}>, <End-to-end wireframe parsing C, {eid: 85081932291, doi: 10.1109/ICCV.2019.00105}>, <TP-LSD: Tri-points based line segment detectorC, {eid: 85097386249, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-58583-9_46}>, <Automatic building outline extraction from ALS point cloud data using generative adversarial networkJ, {eid: 85135810409, doi: 10.1080/10106049.2022.2102246}>, <Real-time line detection through an improved Hough transform voting schemeJ, {eid: 34548041446, doi: 10.1016/j.patcog.2007.04.003}>, <LSD: A line segment detectorJ, {eid: 84894219323, doi: 10.5201/ipol.2012.gjmr-lsd}>, <EDLines: A real-time line segment detector with a false detection controlJ, {eid: 79960661744, doi: 10.1016/j.patrec.2011.06.001}>, <A progressive morphological filter for removing nonground measurements from airborne LIDAR dataJ, {eid: 0037934719, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2003.810682}>, <Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimationC, {eid: 84990052811, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-46484-8_29}>, <Data optimization of pavement 3D reconstruction based on point preprocessingJ, {eid: 85086146285, doi: 10.13229/j.cnki.jdxbgxb20190121}>",,,China Ship Scientific Research Center,,,2024-09-01,,chi,Journal,2-s2.0-85204961293

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A large percentage of the Costa Rican territory is covered with high evergreen forests. In order to compute a 1′′ Bare-Earth Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for Costa Rica CRDTM2020, stochastic Vegetation Bias (VB) was reduced from the 1′′ NASADEM, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. Several global models such as: canopy heights from the Global Forest Canopy Height 2019 model, canopy heights for the year 2000 from the Forest Canopy Height Map, and canopy density from the Global Forest Change model 2000 to 2019, were used to represent the vegetation in the year of SRTM data collection. Four analytical VB models based on canopy heights and canopy density were evaluated and validated using bare-earth observations and canopy heights from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) surveys from 1998, 2005, and 2019 and a levelling dataset. The results show that differences between CRDTM2020 and bare-earth elevations from LVIS2019 in terms of the mean, median, standard deviation, and median absolute difference (0.9, 0.8, 7.9 and 3.7 m, respectively) are smaller than for any other of the nine evaluated global DEMs.","bare-earth digital elevation model, CRDTM2020, digital terrain model, LVIS, NASADEM, vegetation bias",,,,,,,,"<World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency, {eid: 85075603577}>, <A multi-sensor approach towards a global vegetation corrected SRTM DEM product, {eid: 84968719025}>, <The tree-canopy effect in gravity forward modelling, {eid: 85069674873}>, <A high-accuracy map of global terrain elevations, {eid: 85020717905}>, <A 30 m global map of elevation with forests and buildings removed, {eid: 85130988436}>, <Mapping forest canopy height globally with spaceborne LiDAR, {eid: 81755173018}>, <High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change, {eid: 84887724460}>, <Global Percent Tree Cover at a Spatial Resolution of 500 Meters: First Results of the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields Algorithm, {eid: 0242494415}>, <SRTM vegetation removal and hydrodynamic modeling accuracy, {eid: 84883293132}>, <SRTM DEM Correction in Vegetated Mountain Areas through the Integration of Spaceborne LiDAR, Airborne LiDAR, and Optical Imagery, {eid: 84942520616}>, <Digital terrain model elevation corrections using space-based imagery and ICESat-2 laser altimetry, {eid: 85112336445}>, <Modeling large-scale inundation of Amazonian seasonally flooded wetlands, {eid: 34948847134}>, <SRTM C-band and ICESat laser altimetry elevation comparisons as a function of tree cover and relief, {eid: 33644683948}>, <An Operational Framework for Land Cover Classification in the Context of REDD+ Mechanisms.

The concept of the respective lab was revised with regard to its implementation as a remote laboratory. Fortunately, real-world labs were able to be fully replaced by remote labs. Student perceptions of remote labs were mostly positive. This paper explains the concept and design of the digital twins and the lab as well as the layout, procedure, and finally the results of the accompanying evaluation.

Traditional optimization methods for residential electricity usage in peak-demand hours often lack flexibility and effectiveness in solving practical problems due to a large amount of data and a high degree of data uncertainty. Our study aims to obtain a high degree of responsiveness for numerous and highly dispersed residential customers by integrating data-driven and model-driven methods. In this study, we conducted large-scale DSR controlled trials, collected 15-min intervals of electricity consumption data, and matched the survey data. A dynamic time-warping clustering-based difference-in-difference method was proposed for empirical analysis. The results indicate that monetary incentives induced a statistically significant reduction in electricity usage during peak periods in summer by 18.6%, while the response effect was not significant in winter. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that the reduction was mainly contributed by the middle-income group and the elderly group. Our study provides a basis for policymakers to formulate tailored policies to optimize residents’ electricity consumption during peak hours.","DSR management, DTW-clustering, Large-scale randomized controlled trials, Monetary incentives",,,,,,,,"<Load scheduling for household energy consumption optimization, {eid: 84890549571}>, <A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the penetration of Smart Grid technologies in the Saudi Arabian electricity infrastructure, {eid: 85069555243}>, <Residential consumption of gas and electricity in the US: The role of prices and income, {eid: 80052147896}>, <An integer programming method for the design of multi-criteria multi-action conservation plans, {eid: 85074526350}>, <A hybrid intelligent approach for the prediction of electricity consumption, {eid: 84862244725}>, <Further exploring the potential of residential demand response programs in electricity distribution, {eid: 84898874282}>, <DR-Advisor: A data-driven demand response recommender system, {eid: 84962314284}>, <The role of income in energy consumption behaviour: Evidence from French households data, {eid: 80855139608}>, <A Distributed Direct Load Control Approach for Large-Scale Residential Demand Response, {eid: 84906784307}>, <Short-term electrical load forecasting using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to calculate the demand response baseline for office buildings J, {eid: 85016077419}>, <Demand response in China: Regulations, pilot projects and recommendations – A review, {eid: 84954199436}>, <Incentive-based demand response programs designed by asset-light retail electricity providers for the day-ahead market, {eid: 84926220026}>, <A hybrid simulation-based optimization framework supporting strategic maintenance development to improve production performance, {eid: 85071569509}>, <Advancing an energy justice perspective of fuel poverty: Household vulnerability and domestic retrofit policy in the United Kingdom, {eid: 85019450216}>, <Dtw schemes for continuous speech recognition: A unified view, {eid: 0003195159}>, <Residential demand response behavior analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation: The case of Yinchuan in China, {eid: 84868553266}>, <Price-responsive model-based optimal demand response control of inverter air conditioners using genetic algorithm, {eid: 85044151800}>, <Do consumers respond to marginal or average price?

It is believed that if businesses can collect user feedback (such as through surveys) before they rate a product, they can analyze people's product experiences at minimal cost. However, most comments are in free-form, slang, or internet language, and manually categorizing and annotating them would require significant resources, which is not feasible for small and medium -sized businesses. To address this issue, some deep learning frameworks have been used for sentiment analysis and rating prediction in text. However, these models often overlook the actual application scenario when predicting ratings. In reality, users' ratings are not solely based on their own experiences but are also influenced by the historical comments on the product. Therefore, we propose a supervised product rating prediction model. In the first stage, the improved dynamic TextRank submodule (DTsub) and a lightweight Feature Fusion submodule (FFsub) are used to construct text vectors, utilizing a sentiment word library.

Phishing attackers disguise illegal URLs as normal ones to steal user's private information with the social engineering techniques, such as emails and SMS, which calls for an effective method of preventing phishing attacks to relieve the loss by them. Neural networks can be used to detect and prevent phishing attacks because of their strong active learning abilities from massive datasets and high accuracy in data classification. However, duplicate points in the public datasets and negative and useless features in the feature vectors will trap the training of the neural networks into the problem of over-fitting, which will make the trained classifier weak when detect phishing websites. This paper proposes DTOF-ANN (Decision Tree and Optimal Features based Artificial Neural Network) to tackle this shortcoming, which is a neural-network phishing detection model based on decision tree and optimal feature selection. First, the traditional K-medoids clustering algorithm is improved with an incremental selection of initial centers to remove the duplicate points from the public datasets. Then, an optimal feature selection algorithm based on the new defined feature evaluation index, decision tree and local search method is designed to prune out the negative and useless features. Finally, the optimal structure of the neural network classifier is constructed through properly adjusting parameters and trained by the selected optimal features. Experimental results have demonstrated that DTOF-ANN exhibits higher performance than many of the existing methods.","Feature selection, K-medoids clustering, Neural network, Phishing detection",,,,,,,,"<A survey of phishing attacks: their types, vectors and technical approaches, {eid: 85045284469}>, <None, {eid: 85087199535}>, <Phishing detection based associative classification data mining, {eid: 84899698551}>, <Why phishing still works: user strategies for combating phishing attacks, {eid: 84931259915}>, <Phishing detection: A literature survey, {eid: 84888328281}>, <OFS-NN: An effective phishing websites detection model based on optimal feature selection and neural network, {eid: 85067673424}>, <None, {eid: 70350630557}>, <None, {eid: 85016035948}>, <None, {eid: 62449094173}>, <Detecting phishing web pages with visual similarity assessment based on earth movers distance (EMD), {eid: 33751538239}>, <An efficient approach to detecting phishing web, {eid: 84880386518}>, <None, {eid: 35348905575}>, <A new fast associative classification algorithm for detecting phishing websites, {eid: 84989851225}>, <None, {eid: 84985994461}>, <Detecting redirection spam using multilayer perceptron neural network, {eid: 85015101549}>, <Detection of phishing websites based on probabilistic neural networks and K-medoids clustering, {eid: 85170203639}>, <None, {eid: 80052560163}>, <Feature selection for phishing detection: A review of research, {eid: 85086417756}>, <Off-the-hook: An efficient and usable client-side phishing prevention application, {eid: 85029649779}>, <None, {eid: 85087203004}>, <None, {eid: 77953329477}>, <Web phishing detection based on page spatial layout similarity, {eid: 84885444058}>, <None, {eid: 85119711263}>, <None, {eid: 39049164431}>, <An efficient phishing webpage detector, {eid: 79957997863}>, <A novel lightweight URL phishing detection system using SVM and similarity index, {eid: 85020465562}>, <A framework for predicting phishing websites using neural networks, {eid: 84871842042}>, <Predicting phishing websites based on self-structuring neural network, {eid: 85027950235}>, <None, {eid: 84940507342}>, <A new hybrid ensemble feature selection framework for machine learning-based phishing detection system, {eid: 85060880885}>, <None, {eid: 79952520242}>, <None, {eid: 85071360860}>, <Local search algorithms for solving the combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems, {eid: 84952334366}>, <Intelligent rule-based phishing websites classification, {eid: 84899720952}>, <None, {eid: 85087198135}>, <None, {eid: 85087201796}>, <Cantina+: A feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting phishing web sites, {eid: 81855218311}>, <None, {eid: 85017290755}>, <Enhancement of spam detection mechanism based on hybrid k-mean clustering and support vector machine, {eid: 84942191718}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,2020-10-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85087199187

To that end, it is important to facilitate decision making in case of unexpected failure by quantifying the uncertain and dynamic nature of the physical phenomena involved. Combining probabilistic and deterministic models is a particularly promising approach to address this issue. In particular, Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) based digital twins are relevant as they embed random variables evolving overtime. Previous research used this modeling method for several applications such as monitoring structural health or manufacturing processes. We envision that the space exploration sector can also benefit from this approach by using the insight gained on specific sub-systems. In this study, we propose lessons learned on the implementation process of PGM-based Digital Twin to quantify uncertainties for temperature prognosis in ECLSS. These findings are introduced as a step-by-step guideline which result in developing a probabilistic model applicable to space habitats. We focused on directed acyclic graphs as this type of PGM can integrate expert's knowledge with data which has been proven to enhance accuracy. A literature review was conducted to identify the state-of-the-art practices and the proposed lessons learned were derived from the study of a physical infrastructure meant to predict the behavior of a space habitat. A temperature control failure scenario was considered, and the Digital Twin estimated the time available before the temperature would become critical. Experiments were conducted on three office rooms to simulate the behavior of an ECLSS. The model was trained offline using historical sensor data and performed inference online by computing the conditional probability of a multivariate normal density. We found that a successful implementation process requires to iteratively go through four stages: outline, design, calibrate and evaluate. It involves selecting ECLSS relevant functionalities and an associated decision-making problem that relies on habitability criteria. Observable variables must be chosen according to a sensors architecture that is compatible with a typical habitat infrastructure. As real space systems are not easily available for model validation, we suggest evaluating early designs on high fidelity analogs. In future work, we envisage to further assess the impact of the design stage on the model's performance by considering computational cost and inference capability.","Digital twin, ECLSS, Probabilistic graphical model, Space habitat",,,,,,,,"<Failure mode and effects analysis for environmental control and life support system self-awareness, {eid: 85097669451}>, <None, {eid: 85152561381}>, <None, {eid: 85152578178}>, <None, {eid: 84880829168, doi: 10.2514/6.2012-1818}>, <Estimation of system states for non-measured parameters and integration with a digital twin framework to boost spacecraft autonomy and awareness, {eid: 85152531788}>, <Digital twin for the structural health management of reusable spacecraft: a case study, {eid: 85085243806, doi: 10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.107076}>, <Hidden Markov model-based digital twin construction for futuristic manufacturing systems, {eid: 85065234372, doi: 10.1017/S089006041900012X}>, <Dynamic Bayesian network for aircraft wing health monitoring digital twin, {eid: 85014566387, doi: 10.2514/1.J055201}>, <A probabilistic graphical model foundation for enabling predictive digital twins at scale, {eid: 85115144191}>, <Ten iterative steps in development and evaluation of environmental models, {eid: 33645947036, doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.01.004}>, <Good practice in Bayesian network modelling, {eid: 84861920466, doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.03.012}>, <Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs, {eid: 0003448310}>, <Probabilistic graphical models: principles and techniques, {eid: 70649111792}>, <Water innovations and lessons learned from water recycling in space, {eid: 85097670201}>, <Detection of conflicting functional requirements in a use case-driven approach, {eid: 0036036781, doi: 10.1145/581352.581355}>, <Maintenance and Repair Task Shortlist for Practical Demonstration, {eid: 85152571161}>, <pgmpy: Probabilistic Graphical Models using Python, {eid: 85049051329, doi: 10.25080/Majora-7b98e3ed-001}>, <None, {eid: 85056871497}>, <PGM_PyLib: a toolkit for probabilistic graphical models in python, {eid: 85152539279}>, <PyGModels: a python package for exploring probabilistic graphical models with graph theoretical structures, {eid: 85152528571, doi: 10.21105/joss.03115}>, <None, {eid: 85152533250}>, <The HUGIN Graphical User Interface — HUGIN GUI 9.2 documentation, {eid: 85152576334}>, <None, {eid: 85064955106}>, <Integration of model verification, validation, and calibration for uncertainty quantification in engineering systems, {eid: 84923253598, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2015.01.023}>, <None, {eid: 85152514018}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,2023-06-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85152517199

All rights reserved.Due to the influence of buildings, the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) obtained through remote sensing measurement still contains various ground features in urban areas and cannot reflect the bare Earth's surface. This limits its application as basic data in hydrological simulation, geological disaster prediction, urban construction, and other fields. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of GDEM products in urban areas, this paper proposed a GDEM correction method that takes into account spatial heterogeneity and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) feature screening. Firstly, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Theissen polygons were used to divide the study region into the several sub-areas to solve the heterogeneity of GDEM correction error and the spatial relationship of characteristic factors. Then, the Random Forest (RF) was used as the base model, coupled with the SHAP interpretable framework, to screen the optimal feature variables in each subregion. Finally, based on the selected features, the corresponding modified model was reconstructed for urban GDEM correction. To verify the practicability and efficiency of the proposed method, 23 initial feature variables were selected in this paper. COPDEM (COPDEM30) with 30 m resolution in New York was taken as the research object, and airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) DTM data were used as the reference. The proposed method was compared with three other methods, including spatially heterogeneous random forest (SH-RF), global random forest (FS- RF), and traditional Random Forest (RF), as well as an existing GDEM (FABDEM) product which removes building and vegetation biases. The experimental results show that the proposed method had the best prediction performance, with its Mean Absolute Error (MAE) decreasing from 5.209 m to 1.436 m and median error (RMSE) decreasing from 8.884 m to 2.258 m, followed by SH-RF, with its MAE decreasing by 3.607 m and RMSE decreasing by 6.389 m. RF was the worst, with MAE decreasing by 3.179 m and RMSE decreasing by 5.838 m. In addition, compared to FABDEM, the MAE and RMSE of the proposed method were reduced by 42.3% and 63.2%, respectively. The migration experiments on the proposed method showed that, compared to the original COPDEM30, the modified GDEM's MAE and RMSE were reduced by 50.5% and 50.4%, respectively. The visual comparison of the DEM before and after modification also showed that the modified COPDEM30 not only retained the topographic features well but also had similar elevation distribution with LiDAR DTM.

The set of solutions includes targeted recommendations for additional well surveys followed by producers and injectors workovers, like whole wellbore or selective stimulation, polymer flow conformance, hydraulic fracturing and side tracking. As a result, previously poorly drained areas are involved in production, which increases current rates and ultimate recovery. The integrated technology of residual reserves localization and production increase includes: 1. Primary analysis of the production history for reservoir blocks ranking by production increase potential. 2. Advanced bottom-hole pressures and production history analysis by multiwell deconvolution for pressure maintenance system optimization and production enhancement. 3. Advanced production logging for flow profile and production layer-by-layer allocation. 4. Conducting pulse-code interference testing for average saturation between wells estimation. 5. 3D reservoir dynamic model calibration on advanced tests findings. 6. Multi-scenario development planning for the scenario with biggest NPV regarding surface infrastructure. The presented integrated technology is carried stage by stage. Based on the data analysis at the first stage (the Prime analysis) it is possible to get three types of results. The top-level assessment of the current development opportunities of the area, evaluation of current residual reserves on base of displacement sweep efficiency estimation, and evaluation of the potential production increase for various blocks of the field. Results of the second stage were obtained for the block deemed with the highest potential for production increase. Those results may reveal possible complications, and relevant workovers can be advised along with additional surveys that can further help to locate current reserves. The last stage of Prime analysis provides the most suitable choice was to perform an advanced logging and well-testing, as they include both single-well and multi-well tests. Pulse-code interference tests, multi-well retrospective tests and reservoir-oriented production logging make it possible to scan the reservoir laterally and vertically, which is especially important for multi-layered fields. The reservoir parameters obtained from the test results are used to calibrate the dynamic reservoir model. The effects of production enhancement operations are calculated from the 3D model. The set of possible activities is evaluated in terms of their financial efficiency based on the economic model of the operator company using multi-scenario approach on a specifically created digital twin of the field. The unique feature of this approach lies in an integrated usage of advanced production history analysis, advanced logging and well-testing technologies, as well as further calibration of the dynamic reservoir model based on test results and used-friendly interface for field digital twin interaction. This paper demonstrates on how to use the field tests results to calibrate the reservoir model and increase the accuracy of production forecasting by reducing the model uncertainty, with intent to increase profit of brownfields.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85117721477}>, <None, {eid: 85118453338}>, <None, {eid: 85118450771}>, <None, {eid: 85094967875}>, <None, {eid: 85118432761}>, <None, {eid: 85118450839}>, <None, {eid: 85118458294}>, <Dynamic Reservoir-Pressure Maintenance System Study in Carbonate Reservoir with Complicated Pore Structure by Production Analysis, {eid: 85088203820}>, <None, {eid: 85118447407}>, <None, {eid: 85118457538}>, <Interference and Pulse Testing-A Review, {eid: 0020943904, doi: 10.2118/10042-PA}>, <None, {eid: 78650505720}>, <Application of Multi Well Pressure Pulse-Code Testing for 3D Model Calibration, {eid: 84994092389, doi: 10.2118/181555-MS}>, <Verifying Reserves Opportunities with Multi-Well Pressure Pulse-Code Testing, {eid: 85088074454, doi: 10.2118/187927-MS}>, <Carbonate Reservoir Waterflood Efficiency Monitoring with Cross-Well Pulse-Code Pressure Testing, {eid: 85086687573, doi: 10.2118/189258-MS}>, <None, {eid: 85118427308}>, <None, {eid: 85118433587}>, <None, {eid: 85118469236}>, <None, {eid: 85108071424}>, <None, {eid: 85118461249}>",,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,,,2021-10-18,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85118429170

In the present study, firstly, the vertical accuracy of the global DEMs is assessed using datasets of three independent Ground Control Point (GCP) measurements while accounting for the spatial and temporal variabilities with respect to DEM data acquisitions. Next, we investigate their suitability for flood inundation modelling by developing hydrodynamic models. The accuracy of global DEMs, viz. SRTM, MERIT, AW3D30, COPDEM30, TanDEM-X 12, TanDEM-X 90, FABDEM, and CartoDEM are assessed for Lower Tapi Basin (LTB), India using ICESat-1 and ICESat-2 laser altimetry, and GNSS surveyed locations. The potential of TanDEM-X 12 DEM for deriving Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the Digital Surface Model (DSM) has been explored by adopting Simple Morphological Filter (SMRF) and void-filling approaches. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation of these DEMs that includes DSMs and DTMs in flood inundation modelling is carried out by simulating the severe fluvial flood event of magnitude 25,768 m3/sec that occurred in the year 2006 in LTB through 1D-2D coupled Hydro-Dynamic (HD) models using HEC-RAS software. Prior to development of HD models using global DEMs and DTMs as terrain layer, a benchmark model has been simulated for the same event with terrain layer as topographic surveyed contours of the basin. The least flood depth error has been observed for the FABDEM model (RMSE: 1.59 m), followed by the model with terrain topography as the derived “TanDEM-X 12 DTM-AMP-HEM-EVF” (RMSE: 1.88 m). On the other hand, the HD model based on TanDEM-X 12 DTM AMP-HEM-EVF has been able to simulate flood inundation extent better than the FABDEM model for the same flood event in the basin with Critical Success Index (CSI) scores 0.91 and 0.81 respectively. The TanDEM-X 12 DTM-AMP-HEM-EVF terrain-based model indicated consistently superior results in capturing flood inundation extent, leaving behind all the DSMs whose CSI scores are found to be less than 50 %. The global DEMs that are inherently DSMs in nature are unsuitable for flood inundation modelling as they fail to capture the flood pathways in urban topographies with precision. From the systematic framework followed in the present study, it is inferred that the processed TanDEM-X 12 DEM for the removal of artifacts could be a successful replacement to obtain bare-earth topography. In the absence of TanDEM-X 12 DEM, the freely available FABDEM can be used as an alternative source for terrain layer in flood modelling as its results are comparable to the derived terrain topography of TanDEM-X 12 DEM. The study is one of the first to assess the performance of FABDEM in flood modelling of coastal urban floodplain.","DEM accuracy, Digital Terrain Model, FABDEM, ICESat, Lower Tapi Basin,

A.Ş.>, <Department of Civil Engineering, Ege University>",,"© 2024This study aims to investigate the predictive occupant demographic characteristics of thermal sensation (TS) and thermal satisfaction (TSa) as well as to find the most effective machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting TS and TSa. To achieve this, a survey campaign was carried out in three mixed-mode buildings to develop TS and TSa prediction models by using six ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) and Support Vector Machine). The prediction models were developed based on six demographic characteristics (gender, age, thermal history, education level, income, occupation). The results show that gender, age, and thermal history are significant predictors of both TS and TSa. Education level, income, and occupation were not significant predictors of TS, but were significant predictors of TSa. The study also found that RF and KNN are the most effective ML algorithms for predicting TS, while DT and RF are the most effective ML algorithms for predicting TSa. The study found that the accuracy of TS prediction models ranges from 83% to 99%, with neutral being the most correctly classified scale. The accuracy of TSa prediction models ranges from 84% to 97%, with dissatisfaction being the most common misclassification.","Demographic characteristics, Machine learning, Prediction model, Thermal satisfaction, Thermal sensation",,,,,,,,"<User response to indoor thermal environment in female high school buildings in Oman, {eid: 85121456109, doi: 10.1080/09613218.2021.2006593}>, <Influence of hot arid climate on the use of outdoor urban spaces and thermal comfort: do cultural and social backgrounds matter?

These factors are funding, information technology (IT) infrastructure, technical support, digital skills or talents, organizational culture, employee resistance and top management support. These factors were tested to determine whether they affected HR DT in Bahrain during COVID-19. There are no findings in the researched literature regarding the proposed factors that affect HR DT in Bahrain during COVID-19 in this study. Design/methodology/approach: For data collection, a quantitative method was applied by conducting an online survey and distributing it to HR executives and employees from multiple organizations in Bahrain, both in the private and public sectors. Findings: This study proposes a DT adoption model based on seven factors extracted from the literature review. A questionnaire was deployed, and accurate data were collected, processed and then analyzed. The logit model shows determinants factor to the DT adoption where all variables have a positive effect. Originality/value: Using technology in an organization’s HR practices, known as e-HRM or HR DT, is becoming more crucial since the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike European countries, the HR sector in Bahrain is not prepared to adopt the e-HRM process. This paper proposes a model that enables the HR sector to adopt digital technologies. This model is based on the key factors that enable an effective transition to the sector’s digitalization (e-HRM). Future research is sought to provide additional insights into the same factors and measure their effect on HR DT during COVID-19 in other countries.","COVID-19, Digital transformation adoption, e-HRM, Human resource management (HRM), Logistic regression",,,,,,,,"<Using balanced scorecard in measuring the performance of online banking: Cultivating strategic model map in financial sector-case of Bahrain, {eid: 85100645234}>, <Role of human resource management in the learning organization: An empirical study of public sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain, {eid: 85074088962}>, <Investigating the factors affecting job satisfaction and turnover: Case of Sultan Qaboos University, {eid: 85061210786}>, <Evaluation of information systems security awareness in higher education: An empirical study of Kuwait University, {eid: 85066951012}>, <Effects of technology and digital innovations on the human resources ecosystem, {eid: 85125769107}>, <Global reverberation and prediction for HRM amid and after COVID-19: A technological viewpoint, {eid: 85115320059, doi: 10.1016/j.matpr.2020.11.544}>, <Digital transformation of HR management system, {eid: 85133206624, doi: 10.2991/aebmr.k.210222.011}>, <Hr digital transformation, {eid: 85116709197}>, <Assessing the accuracy of prediction algorithms for classification: An overview, {eid: 0033931867}>, <Employee adjustment and well-being in the era of COVID-19: Implications for human resource management, {eid: 85085213819, doi: 10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.05.037}>, <IJHRM after 30 years: Taking stock in times of COVID- 19 and looking towards the future of HR research, {eid: 85092801438, doi: 10.1080/09585192.2020.1833070}>, <Digital transformation, {eid: 85049725829}>, <Effects of covid-19 on human resource management from the perspective of digitalization and work-life-balance, {eid: 85106603595, doi: 10.31435/rsglobal_ijite/30092020/7148}>, <Human resource management and performance: A review and research agenda, {eid: 2842511491}>, <High-involvement work practices, turnover, and productivity: Evidence from New Zealand, {eid: 0035529301}>, <None, {eid: 84977601395}>, <The impact of human resource management practices on turnover, productivity, and corporate financial performance, {eid: 13144250328}>, <Building a strategic HR function: Continuing the evolution, {eid: 27744541890}>, <The benefits of e-HRM and AI for talent acquisition, {eid: 85087799234, doi: 10.1108/jtf-02-2020-0013}>, <Workforce diversity and organizational performance during COVID-19: Evidence from pharmaceutical companies, {eid: 85174557782, doi: 10.9734/jpri/2021/v33i60a34550}>, <The impact of pandemic COVID -19 in the workplace, {eid: 85090916364, doi: 10.7176/EJBM/12-15-02}>, <Talent management practice effectiveness: Investigating employee perspective, {eid: 85008323034, doi: 10.1108/er-01-2016-0005}>, <The relationship between ‘high-performance work practices’ and employee attitudes: An investigation of additive and interaction effects, {eid: 34247554899}>, <Social posting in covid-19 recruiting era- milestone hr strategy augmenting social media recruitment, {eid: 85100580173, doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.36745.67684}>, <Human resource management, strategic involvement and e-HRM technology, {eid: 84949568783, doi: 10.1080/09585192.2015.1091980}>, <Conceptualizing digital transformation in business organizations: A systematic review of literature, {eid: 85069150374, doi: 10.18690/978-961-286-043-1.30}>, <Effects of coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) on selected human resource management practices in Tanzania, {eid: 85119046896}>, <The role of human resource practices in the implementation of digital transformation, {eid: 85117963017, doi: 10.1108/ijm-03-2021-0176}>, <The coronavirus and the employees: A study from the point of human resource management, {eid: 85108668318}>, <The impact of pandemic COVID -19 in workplace, {eid: 85090916364, doi: 10.7176/EJBM/12-15-02}>, <An examination of e-HRM as a means to increase the value of the HR function, {eid: 79953222243, doi: 10.1080/09585192.2011.556791}>, <Top-down induction of decision trees classifiers-a survey, {eid: 27844467756}>, <Digital transformation of business.

In education, DT has been regarded as a constructivist teaching methodology that integrates both divergent thinking and aggregated thinking. DT is a process from conceiving, prototyping to evaluation and finally defining innovative solutions. Such a process should be flexible, nonlinear, and dynamic. However, it depends on the application process of the Design Thinking models. Based on literature review and case study analysis, this section (1) reviews a list of typical Design Thinking models and their processes, (2) compares and analyzes these models to describe their core attributes and thinking characteristics, and (3) introduces commonly used thinking tools to explain how they provide new solutions for teaching design and engaging students in learning.

We tested whether landscape topography and underlying geology could predict the vegetation density of a 19 km2 area of wet eucalypt forest at the Warra Long-Term Ecological Research Supersite, Tasmania, Australia. Using spatial layers for 12 topographic attributes derived from digital terrain models (DTMs) and a geology layer, we predicted the vegetation density of three strata with a high degree of accuracy (validation root mean square error ranged from 9.0% to 13.7%). The DTMs with 30 m resolution provided greater predictive accuracy than DTMs with higher resolution. The importance of different variables depended on spatial resolution and strata. Among the predictor variables, geology generally had the highest predictive importance, followed by solar radiation. Topographic Position Index, aspect, and System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) Wetness Index had moderate importance. This study demonstrates that geological and topographic attributes can provide useful predictions for the density of vegetation layers in a tall wet sclerophyll primary forest. Given the good performance of the model based on 30 m DTM resolution, the predictive power of the models could be tested on a larger geographical area using lower-density LiDAR point clouds combined with medium-resolution satellite data.","airborne LiDAR, digital terrain model, geology, random forest, topographic attributes, variable importance, vegetation density, wet eucalypt

All rights reserved.Digital Transformation (DT) implies the emergence of new business models based on the widespread use of digital technologies. DT is necessary to improve productivity and access to markets, however, from a gender perspective, there is a digital divide. In this research, the objective is to study the DT from a gender perspective in a specific sector, the agri-food sector, and in a type of specific social economy entity that is fundamental in rural areas, the agri-food cooperatives. In these companies, there is still a gender gap, especially due to the lower proportion of women in the management teams and, in addition, they lag behind other companies in terms of DT. Specifically, DT is analysed in these cooperatives both globally and through the analysis of each of its dimensions: infrastructures, products, organisation, processes and customers. To this end, the study is based on data from a survey among a sample of agri-food cooperatives in Extremadura, a region with a strong specialisation in the agri-food sector and where cooperatives play an important economic, social and environmental role. The results show that the presence of women in the presidency of these cooperatives has a positive influence on the presence of women in their management teams. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the overall DT of these co-operatives with respect to the gender factor, although there are differences in the specific dimensions of “customers” and “processes”.","agri-food cooperatives, brecha digital, cooperativas agroalimentarias, digital divide, Digital transformation, gender, género, Transformación digital",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84882663836}>, <Towards understanding the gender digital divide: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85121308492, doi: 10.1108/GKMC-09-2021-0147}>, <Rural women entrepreneurship: a systematic literature review and beyond, {eid: 85137173108, doi: 10.1108/WJSTSD-04-2021-0039}>, <An integrated conceptual framework for the study of agricultural cooperatives: from repolitisation to cooperative sustainability, {eid: 85088990227, doi: 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.06.019}>, <Digital transformation among SMEs: Does gender matter?, {eid: 85122200769, doi: 10.3390/su14010535}>, <New trends in the global digital transformation process of the agri-food sector: An exploratory study based on Twitter, {eid: 85138371040, doi: 10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103520}>, <Mujeres y cooperativismo en España.

The algorithm constructs binary tree data structures that partition the data into smaller segments according to different rules. Hence, DTs can be used as a learning process of finding the optimal rules to separate and classify all items of a dataset. Since the algorithm relies on a decision process similar to rule-based decisions, they are easily interpretable. However, DTs can be difficult to analyse when dealing with large datasets and/or with multiple trees, i.e. ensembles. To ease the analysis and validation of these models, we developed a visual tool which includes a set of visualizations that overview and give details of a set of trees. Our tool aims to provide different perspectives over the same data and provide further insights on how decisions are being made. In this article, we overview our design process, present the different visualization models and their iterative validation. We present a use case in the telecommunications domain. In concrete, we use the visual tool to help understand how a model based on DTs decides which is the best channel (i.e., phonecall, e-mail, SMS) to contact a client.","Decision Tree, Random Forest, Visual Analytics",,,,,,,,"<Design and evaluation of visualization support to facilitate decision trees classification, {eid: 33751318496}>, <None, {eid: 0003584577}>, <Random forests, {eid: 0035478854}>, <Iforest: Interpreting random forests via visual analytics, {eid: 85052853255}>, <Interactive machine learning: Letting users build classifiers, {eid: 0035470418}>, <Vdm-rs: A visual data mining system for exploring and classifying remotely sensed images, {eid: 68749106829}>, <Baobabview: Interactive construction and analysis of decision trees, {eid: 84855803166}>, <Basic concept pythagoras tree for construct data visualization on decision tree learning, {eid: 85076527252}>, <Interactive exploration of decision tree results, {eid: 84855771071}>, <Visual data mining with pixel-oriented visualization techniques, {eid: 33744502822}>, <Visualization of decision rules-from the cardiologists point of view, {eid: 62249190626}>, <Concept tree based clustering visualization with shaded similarity matrices, {eid: 38049073352}>, <Case study: Visualization for decision tree analysis in data mining, {eid: 0035202164}>, <The plane with parallel coordinates, {eid: 0022140354}>, <Visualizing categorical data: Data, stories, and pictures, {eid: 33744722578}>, <Surrogate decision tree visualization interpreting and visualizing black-box classification models with surrogate decision tree, {eid: 85063203196}>, <Rulematrix: Visualizing and understanding classifiers with rules, {eid: 85051767155}>, <Matrix reordering methods for table and network visualization, {eid: 84979066943}>, <None, {eid: 85009504003}>, <Explainable matrixvisualization for global and local interpretability of random forest classification ensembles, {eid: 85099560009}>, <None, {eid: 85063916944}>, <Visualizing the random forest by 3d techniques, {eid: 84865015945}>, <None, {eid: 85132518884}>, <None, {eid: 84886646387}>, <The mythos of model interpretability: In machine learning, the concept of interpretability is both important and slippery, {eid: 85051792338}>, <Human-centric justification of machine learning predictions, {eid: 85031934524}>, <Node-link or adjacency matrices: Old question, new insights, {eid: 85051814060}>, <None, {eid: 0003892072}>, <Sizing the horizon: The effects of chart size and layering on the graphical perception of time series visualizations, {eid: 84892463502}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-07-25,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85178503943

Yet, its potentials are manifold and, in most cases, outweigh the disadvantages. Beneath terms such as ""big data"", ""digital twin"", the term ""data-driven engineering"" has evolved over the last years. However, neither in literature nor in industry, there is a unified definition or understanding of the term. The presented research is based on a literature review as well as an industrial case study. Several databases were screened systematically for the literature review and forward and backward searches were used additionally. The case study was conducted in a collaboration with a company in the climate system sector. First, a literature-based distinction between the terms model-based, model-driven, data-based, and data-driven as well as definitions of data-driven engineering were investigated. Representatives of the company then evaluated these findings in a workshop and together with the industry partner a consistent definition was developed. The authors define data-driven engineering as a framework for product development in which the goal-oriented collection and use of sufficiently connected product lifecycle data guides and drives decisions and applications in the product development process. Further, promising use cases for the industry partner regarding data-driven engineering were formulated. The use cases were initially evaluated and prioritized regarding their cost-benefit ratio. Symbioses with other strategies of the company such as Digital Twins, model-based engineering, and solution space engineering are outlined. For academia, the presented findings provide a consistent definition that can be used as a promising direction for future research. Especially a procedure model for the systematic conception and implementation of data-driven engineering would be beneficial.

As nations transition to ICD-11, ensuring its acceptance among the users is essential. To our knowledge, there are limited studies about the instrument and ICD-11 adoption. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design an instrument and investigate the factors influencing the intention to use the ICD-11 among medical record officers (MROs) and assistant medical record officers (AMROs) at Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia facilities. Based on the current literature, a model based on the decomposed theory of planned behaviour (DTPB) was proposed. The model consisted of 13 dimensions and 12 hypotheses identified from previous studies. Using PLS-SEM, 185 survey data points were analysed. The study findings showed that ten factors have a significant impact on the suggested model. Users' subjective norm was the most influential factor in their intention to use ICD-11. Unexpectedly, perceived usefulness and was found to have no significant influence. This study is important for policymakers in strategising ICD-11 implementation efforts. This study's novelty lies in applying a DTPB theory model in the context of the intention to use ICD-11.",,,,,,,,,"<Data from clinical notes: A perspective on the tension between structure and flexible documentation, {eid: 79953093873, doi: 10.1136/jamia.2010.007237}>, <World Health Organization.

Tridosha defines the three basic energies or principles that determine the function of our body on the physical and emotional levels. The three energies are known as VATT, PITT and KAPH. Each individual has a unique balance of all three of these energies. Some people will be predominant in one, while others will be a mixture of two or more. Ayurveda-dosha studies have been used for a long time, but the quantitative reliability measurement of these diagnostic methods still lags behind. A careful and appropriate analysis leads to an effective treatment. To collect a meaningful data set, a questionnaire with 28 different characteristics is validated by Ayurveda experts. Authors calculate Cronbach alpha of VATT-Dosha, PITT-Dosha and KAPH-Dosha as 0.94, 0.98 and 0.98, respectively to check the reliability of the questionnaire. Authors analyzed questionnaires of 807 healthy persons aged 20-60 years and found 62.1% men and 37.9% women. The class imbalance problem is resolved with oversampling and the equally distributed data set of randomly selected 405 persons is used for the actual experiment. Using computer algorithms, we randomly divide the data set (8:2) into a training set of 324 persons and a test data set of 81 persons. Model is trained using traditional machine learning techniques for classification analysis as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). System is also implemented using ensemble of several machine learning methods for constitution recognition. Evaluation measures of classification such as root mean square error (RMSE), precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy is calculated and analyzed. On analyzing the results authors find that the data is best trained and tested with CatBoost, which is tuned with hyper parameters and achieves 0.96 precision, 0.95 recall, 0.95 F-score and 0.95 accuracy rate. The experimental result shows that the proposed model based on ensemble learning methods clearly surpasses conventional methods. The results conclude that advances in boosting algorithms could give machine learning a leading future.","Ayurveda, human body constituents, hyper parameter tuning, KAPH, optimized training model, PITT, VATT",,,,,,,,"<Bridging Ayurveda with evidence-based scientific approaches in medicine, {eid: 84926376999}>, <None, {eid: 84946226993}>, <Ayurveda and medicalisation today: The loss of important knowledge and practice in health?, {eid: 85056563833, doi: 10.1016/j.jaim.2018.06.004}>, <Ayurveda and the science of aging, {eid: 85044746296}>, <Ancient archives of Deha-Prakriti (human body constitutional traits) in ayurvedic literature : A critical review, {eid: 85083703758}>, <Prakriti-based research: Good reporting practices, {eid: 84985906149}>, <Possible measures to assess functional states of Tridosha: A critical, {eid: 85069513955}>, <Comparative study of personality with Ayurvedic Prakriti, {eid: 85083691197}>, <Prakriti analysis and its clinical significance, {eid: 85083727466}>, <Critical approaisal of Panchamahabhuta Siddhant, {eid: 85083706891}>, <Reliability of self-reported constitutional questionnaires in ayurveda diagnosis, {eid: 85040107492}>, <Development and standardization of Mysore Tridosha scale, {eid: 84907483280}>, <Ensemble transfer learning algorithm, {eid: 85038847737}>, <Performance enhancement of wind farms using tuned SSSC based on artificial neural network, {eid: 85163934230}>, <Explainable deep learning based medical diagnostic system, {eid: 85064272049}>, <None, {eid: 85083707953}>, <Data-driven modeling and prediction of blood glucose dynamics: Machine learning applications in type 1 diabetes, {eid: 85069975382}>, <Simple random sampling of individual items in the absence of a sampling frame that lists the individuals, {eid: 84983314434}>, <None, {eid: 85083737523}>, <Learning from imbalanced data: Open challenges and future directions, {eid: 85043605198}>, <How do MIS researchers handle missing data in survey-based research: A content analysis approach, {eid: 84879115271}>, <The use of Cronbachs alpha when developing and reporting research instruments in science education, {eid: 85020261089}>, <Data on forecasting energy prices using machine learning, {eid: 85068002511}>, <The assessment of machine learning model performance for predicting alluvial deposits distribution, {eid: 84938561333}>, <Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection, {eid: 84988564472}>, <Engineering fast multilevel support vector machines, {eid: 85065704934}>, <Optimization of K-NN algorithm by clustering and reliability coefficients: Application to breast-cancer diagnosis, {eid: 85045669382}>, <Texture classification using Naïve Bayes classifier, {eid: 85069470692}>, <Soft computing modelling of urban evolution: Tehran metropolis, {eid: 85083718890}>, <Neural network and support vector machine for the prediction of chronic kidney disease: A comparative study, {eid: 85064900208}>, <Integrating the multi-label land-use concept and cellular automata with the artificial neural networkbased land transformation model: An integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework, {eid: 85008400451}>, <Deep neural networks with elastic rectified linear units for object recognition, {eid: 85030543442}>, <Deep convolutional neural network for the automated detection and diagnosis of seizure using EEG signals, {eid: 85030172410}>, <Brain tumor classification using deep CNN features via transfer learning, {eid: 85068241919}>, <Analysis of cardiotocogram data for fetal distress determination by decision tree based adaptive boosting approach, {eid: 84987733118}>, <Formation lithology classification using scalable gradient boosted decision trees, {eid: 85067899644}>, <Accurate liver disease prediction with extreme gradient boosting, {eid: 85072035011}>, <Xgboost application on bridge management systems for proactive damage estimation, {eid: 85065553465}>, <Application of XGBoost algorithm in fingerprinting localisation task, {eid: 85019662046}>, <Hyperparameter tuning and performance assessment of statistical and machine-learning algorithms using spatial data, {eid: 85067413523}>, <Hyperparameter optimization of deep neural network using univariate dynamic encoding algorithm for searches, {eid: 85065414999}>, <Hyperparameter optimization in learning systems, {eid: 85083728072}>, <Implementing majority voting rule to classify corporate value based on environmental efforts, {eid: 85007603298}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85083731055

The LAT can be developed in a continuous (surface) using an estimated LAT surface model from the hydrodynamic ocean model along with coastal discrete LAT point values derived from tide gauges data sets to provide the corrected LAT surface model. In this paper, an accurate LAT surface model was developed for the Red Sea case study using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) with multiple hydrodynamic ocean models hybridization, namely, WebTide, FES2014, DTU10, and EOT11a models. It was found that the developed optimal hybrid LAT model using MLE with multiple hydrodynamic ocean models hybridization ranges from 0.1 m to 1.63 m, associated with about 2.4 cm of uncertainty at a 95% confidence level in the Red Sea case study area. To validate the accuracy of the developed model, the comparison was made between the optimal hybrid LAT model developed from multiple hydrodynamic ocean models hybridization using the MLE method with the individual LAT models estimated from individual WebTide, FES2014, DTU10, or EOT11a ocean models based on the associated uncertainties estimated at a 95% confidence level. It was found that the optimal hybrid LAT model accuracy is superior to the individual LAT models estimated from individual ocean models with an improvement of about 50% in average, based on the estimated uncertainties. The importance of developing optimal LAT surface model using the MLE method with multiple hydrodynamic ocean models hybridization in this paper with few centimeters level of uncertainty can lead to accurate continuous vertical datum estimation that is essential for many maritime applications.","Hybrid model, LAT, MLE, Ocean, Red sea",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85085704704}>, <Development of Saudi continuous chart datum: Arabian Gulf case study, {eid: 85069474662}>, <Development of a seamless multisource topographic/bathymetric elevation model of Tampa Bay, {eid: 0035568851}>, <Accuracy of vertical datum surfaces in coastal and offshore zones, {eid: 84879819725}>, <Creation of vertical reference surfaces at sea using altimetry and GPS, {eid: 84884321301}>, <None, {eid: 85069525778}>, <Hydrographic vertical separation surfaces (HyVSEPs) for the tidal waters of Canada, {eid: 84964040043}>, <The Canadian hydrographic continuous vertical datum: Methodology and accuracy, {eid: 84944947977}>, <Vertical datum separation models for the British Columbia coast, {eid: 85085703995}>, <The continuous vertical datum Canadian waters project (beginnings, vision, methods and progress), {eid: 85085682673}>, <A Kalman filter approach to realize the lowest astronomical tide surface, {eid: 85038392973}>, <Tidal dynamics along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, {eid: 85085685625}>, <Baroclinic tides simulation in the Red Sea: Comparison to observations and basic characteristics, {eid: 85059100162}>, <Simulation of tidal hydrodynamics in the Red Sea using COHERENS model, {eid: 85048765674}>, <None, {eid: 85085708638}>, <The FES2014 tidal atlas, accuracy assessment for satellite altimetry and other geophysical applications, {eid: 85085701422}>, <Multimission empirical ocean tide modeling for shallow waters and polar seas, {eid: 80455130888}>, <Ocean tides from satellite altimetry and GRACE, {eid: 84863854319}>, <None, {eid: 0004023207}>, <None, {eid: 0003675176}>, <Regression models for categorical and limited dependent variables, {eid: 85085683317}>, <None, {eid: 85085695679}>",,,MDPI AG,,,2020-05-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85085701646

Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a diagnostic and prognostic marker of melanoma. However, whether ctDNA mutations can independently predict survival remains controversial. This meta-analysis assessed the prognostic value of the presence or change in ctDNA mutations in melanoma patients. Methods. We identified studies from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. We estimated the combined hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using either fixed-effect or random-effect models based on heterogeneity. Results. Sixteen studies including 1,781 patients were included. Both baseline and posttreatment detectable ctDNA were associated with poor OS (baseline detectable vs. undetectable, pooled HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.64-2.36, P<0.00001; baseline undetectable vs. detectable, pooled HR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.11-0.36, P<0.00001; posttreatment detectable vs. undetectable, pooled HR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.30-4.28, P=0.005). For PFS, baseline detectable ctDNA may be associated with adverse PFS (baseline detectable vs. undetectable, pooled HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.84-2.37, P=0.19; baseline undetectable vs. detectable, pooled HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.95, P=0.04) and baseline high ctDNA and increased ctDNA were significantly associated with adverse PFS (baseline high vs. low/undetectable, pooled HR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.73-6.25, P=0.0003; increase vs. decrease, pooled HR = 4.48, 95% CI = 2.45-8.17, P<0.00001). The baseline BRAFV600 ctDNA mutation-positive group was significantly associated with adverse OS compared with the baseline ctDNA-negative group (pooled HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.58-2.29, P<0.00001). There were no significant differences in PFS between the baseline BRAFV600 ctDNA mutation-detectable group and the undetectable group (pooled HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.72-1.44, P=0.92). Conclusion. The presence or elevation of ctDNA mutation or BRAFV600 ctDNA mutation was significantly associated with worse prognosis in melanoma patients.",,,,,,,,,"<Vemurafenib in patients with BRAFV600mutated

This approach is a derivative of systems engineering (SE) methodologies that appears to be isolated from the SE community and recent developments concerning enterprise resilience. We propose to develop a model-based methodology for the Defense Training System (DTS) design and resilience measurement, implying that DTS workforce has been “engineered” into the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) targeting system’s resilience. This paper presents an initial phase of the research, setting a foundation of the research methodology and conceptual framework, supported by a significant system resilience literature review and DTS resilience case study formulation. Basic factors and measures for DTS resilience are proposed to guide development of the transformation road map from “As Is” (current) to “To Be” (desired) DTS architecture. There is potential for broader application of our model-based resilience framework for any enterprise seeking to be more resilient, especially through better engineering of its training systems and personnel.","Academic literature, Defense training system, Enterprise architecture, Enterprise information systems, Model-based conceptual resilience framework",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise resilience, {eid: 84876474576}>, <Organisational resilience capacity and firm product innovativeness and performance, {eid: 84908576360}>, <None, {eid: 0004075881}>, <Team resilience, {eid: 84941316241}>, <Strategic and operational management of organizational resilience: Current state of research and future directions, {eid: 84939825641}>, <Systems resilience for multihazard environments: Definition, metrics, and valuation for decision making, {eid: 84894261353}>, <None, {eid: 84864493645}>, <High-reliability HR: Preparing the enterprise for catastrophes, {eid: 85048857564}>, <Employee resilience: An emerging challenge for HRM, {eid: 84903764006}>, <Understanding uncertainty and reducing vulnerability: Lessons from resilience thinking, {eid: 34247193527}>, <Resilience: The concept, a literature review and future directions, {eid: 79961175960}>, <None, {eid: 85029446427}>, <Structured engagement in the extended enterprise, {eid: 0035645977}>, <None, {eid: 84962536724}>, <Strategic human resource management practices and organizational resilience, {eid: 85053275967}>, <Resilience in engineered resilient systems, {eid: 85047822611}>, <System of systems dependability - theoretical models and applications examples, {eid: 84948783450}>, <Organisational resilience: Development of a conceptual framework for organisational responses, {eid: 79961198396}>, <A decision-making model for lean, agile, resilient and green supply chain management, {eid: 84865694320}>, <From metaphor to measurement: Resilience of what to what?, {eid: 0035694989}>, <Institutional resilience in healthcare systems, {eid: 0035069589}>, <Resilience index: Proposal and application in the automotive supply chain, {eid: 84868232495}>, <Designing principles to create resilient supply chains, {eid: 44949173920}>, <Construction of an early risk warning model of organizational resilience: An empirical study based on samples of R&D teams, {eid: 84975070446}>, <Building the resilient supply chain, {eid: 84993012775}>, <A dynamic perspective on the resilience of firms: A systematic literature review and a framework for future research, {eid: 85076825591}>, <Resilience, HRM practices and impact on organizational performance and employee well-being, {eid: 84958774774}>, <Enhancing organizational resilience through emergency planning: Learnings from cross-sectoral lessons, {eid: 68749092971}>, <An exploratory framework for the empirical measurement of resilience, {eid: 28844495050}>, <Resilience, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity: Implications for system performance, {eid: 42549138632}>, <On the concept of flexibility: A dual control perspective, {eid: 0030111852}>, <Resilience for lean organisational network, {eid: 85045076957}>, <How do we know about resilience?

The TDX heights developed in this study included nine canopy height models (CHMs) and three model-based forest heights (ModelHs); the nine CHMs were derived from the three digital surface models (DSMs) of (I) TDX 12 m DEM (digital elevation model) product, (II) TDX 90 m DEM product and (III) TDX 5 m DSM, which we developed from two TDX-TSX (TerraSAR-X) image pairs for reference, and the three digital terrain models (DTMs) of (i) an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based DTM (LiDAR DTM), (ii) a topography-based DTM and (iii) the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM; the three ModelHs were developed from the two TDX-TSX image pairs used in (III) and the three DTMs (i to iii) with the Sinc inversion model. In total, 12 AGB estimation models were developed for comparison. In this study, we included the C-band SRTM DEM as one of the DTMs. According to Walker et al. (2007), the SRTM DEM serves as a DTM for most of the Earth's surface, except for the areas with extensive tree and/or shrub coverage, e.g., the boreal and Amazon regions. As our test site is located in a hemi-boreal zone with medium forest cover, we tested the ability of the SRTM DEM to serve as a DTM in our test site. This study especially aimed to analyze the capability of the two TDX DEM products (I and II) to estimate AGB in practice in the hemi-boreal region, and to examine how the different forest height creation methods (the simple DSM and DTM subtraction for the nine CHMs and the Sinc inversion model-based approach for the three ModelHs) and the different spatial resolutions of the three DSMs and three DTMs affected the AGB estimation results. We also conducted the slope-class analysis to see how the varying slopes influenced the AGB estimation accuracies. The results show that the combined use of the PALSAR data and the CHM derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and (i) LiDAR DTM achieved the highest AGB estimation accuracies across the scales (R2 ranged from 0.82 to 0.97), but the CHMs derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and another two DTMs, (ii) and (iii), showed low R2 values at any scales. In contrast, the two CHMs derived from (II) TDX 90 m DEM and both (i) LiDAR DTM and (iii) SRTM DEM showed high R2 values > 0.87 and 0.78, respectively, at the scales > 9.0 ha, but they yielded much lower R2 values at smaller scales. The three ModelHs gave the lowest R2 values across the scales (R2 ranged from 0.39 to 0.60). Analyzed by slope class at the 1.0 ha scale, however, all the 12 AGB estimation models yielded high R2 values > 0.66 at the lowest slope class (0° to 9.9°), including the three ModelHs (R2 ranged between 0.68 to 0.69). The two CHMs derived from (II) TDX 90 m DEM and both (i) LiDAR DTM and (iii) SRTM DEM showed R2 values of 0.80 and 0.71, respectively, at the lowest slope class, while the CHM derived from (I) TDX 12 m DEM and (i) LiDAR DTM showed high R2 values across the slope classes (R2 > 0.82). The results show that (I) TDX 12 m DEM had a high capability to estimate AGB, with a high accuracy across the scales and the slope classes in the form of CHM, but the use of (i) LiDAR DTM was required. On the other hand, (II) TDX 90 m DEM was able to achieve high AGB estimation accuracies not only with (i) LiDAR DTM, but also with (iii) SRTM DEM in the form of CHM, but it was limited to large scales > 9.0 ha; however, all the models developed in this study have the possibility to achieve higher AGB estimation accuracies at the 1.0 ha scale in flat terrains with slope < 10°. The analysis showed the strengths and limitations of each model, and it also indicates that the data creation methods, the spatial resolutions of datasets and topographic features affects the effective spatial scales for AGB mapping, and the optimal combinations of these features should be chosen to obtain high AGB estimation accuracies.","ALOS/PALSAR, Canopy height model, Forest above-ground biomass (AGB), LiDAR, Sinc inversion model, SRTM DEM, TanDEM-X DEM",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85080855448}>, <A large carbon sink in the woody biomass of Northern forests, {eid: 0035909990}>, <Aboveground forest biomass and the global carbon balance, {eid: 20844459799}>, <Applicability of different non-invasive methods for tree mass estimation: A review, {eid: 85019488165}>, <Carbon sinks and tropical forest biomass estimation: A review on role of remote sensing in aboveground-biomass modelling, {eid: 85019471070}>, <A review of radar remote sensing for biomass estimation, {eid: 84925059262}>, <Quantifying Forest Biomass Carbon Stocks from Space, {eid: 85021666084}>, <Combining Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar Data to Estimate Forest Biomass: Status and Prospects, {eid: 84922475290}>, <Relating Forest Biomass to SAR Data, {eid: 0026838244}>, <A study of the relationship between radar backscatter and regenerating forest biomass for space borne SAR instrument, {eid: 0030615907}>, <None, {eid: 85080944147}>, <BioSAR (TM): An inexpensive airborne VHF multiband SAR system for vegetation biomass measurement, {eid: 0033704806}>, <The TropiSAR Airborne Campaign in French Guiana: Objectives, Description, and Observed Temporal Behavior of the Backscatter Signal, {eid: 84864290531}>, <None, {eid: 85080908048}>, <Forest biomass mapping from lidar and radar synergies, {eid: 80052611372}>, <Estimation of forest above-ground biomass using multi-parameter remote sensing data over a cold and arid area, {eid: 84864400365}>, <Natural forest biomass estimation based on plantation information using PALSAR data, {eid: 84908200343}>, <PALSAR 50 m mosaic based national level biomass estimation for REDD+ policies implementation, {eid: 84885086018}>, <The effects of changes in forest biomass on radar backscatter from tree canopies, {eid: 0028848664}>, <Radar backscatter and biomass saturation: Ramifications for global biomass inventory, {eid: 0029276354}>, <Synthetic aperture radar interferometry, {eid: 0032136915}>, <Permanent scatterers in SAR interferometry, {eid: 0035115433}>, <Polarimetric SAR interferometry, {eid: 0032164263}>, <Spaceborne polarimetric SAR interferometry: Performance analysis and mission concepts, {eid: 33745709092}>, <Forest Variable Estimation Using Radargrammetric Processing of TerraSAR-X Images in Boreal Forests, {eid: 84896966192}>, <Estimating Forest Biomass from TerraSAR-X Stripmap Radargrammetry, {eid: 84906778451}>, <TerraSAR-X Stereo Radargrammetry and Airborne Scanning LiDAR Height Metrics in Imputation of Forest Aboveground Biomass and Stem Volume, {eid: 84891010121}>, <State-of-the-art of elevation extraction from satellite SAR data, {eid: 0034010758}>, <None, {eid: 85080886739}>, <The Penetration Depth Derived from the Synthesis of ALOS/PALSAR InSAR Data and ASTER GDEM for the Mapping of Forest Biomass, {eid: 84997471521}>, <Regional Scale Rain-Forest Height Mapping Using Regression-Kriging of Spaceborne and Airborne LiDAR Data: Application on French Guiana, {eid: 84962575853}>, <Integration of lidar and Landsat ETM+ data for estimating and mapping forest canopy height, {eid: 0036789609}>, <Airborne laser scanning and digital stereo imagery measures of forest structure: Comparative results and implications to forest mapping and inventory update, {eid: 84889569770}>, <TanDEM-X: A satellite formation for high resolution SAR interferometry, {eid: 35649022726}>, <First Bistatic Spaceborne SAR Experiments with TanDEM-X, {eid: 84655167571}>, <TanDEM-X: The new global DEM takes shape Article, {eid: 84989962859}>, <None, {eid: 84888012367}>, <None, {eid: 85080859033}>, <Evaluation of TanDEM-X DEMs on selected Brazilian sites: Comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30, {eid: 85046813683}>, <Evaluation of DEM generation based on Interferometric SAR using TanDEM-X data in Tokyo, {eid: 84940779812}>, <Accuracy assessment of ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TDX DEMs for Hispaniola and implications for mapping vulnerability to coastal flooding.

IET Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Institution of Engineering and Technology.Organisations all over the world are going through the process of digital transformation (DT). Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a method and an organising principle that aligns the business's objectives and strategies with the Information Technology strategy and execution plan. EA provides a guide to direct the evolution and transformation of enterprises with technology. The EA principles are one of the key concepts in the definition of EA; they assist in recognizing the organization vision and validating the outcomes. However, the lack of adequate instruments for assessing the current state and identifying opportunities for EA management procedures improvement often leave organisations unsure of where to begin improving their procedures. The aim of this paper is to help organisations identify these improvement opportunities. To do so, a decision model was developed to evaluate the influence DT technologies have on the EA principles proposed by The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). A literature review was conducted, and five main DT Technologies applied in the EA scope were identified. With that, a decisional model was created based on two decision-making methods called Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and PROMETHEE. The 21 architecture principles proposed by TOGAF were evaluated and the influence the technologies exercised on the principles were identified. As a result, Big Data and Cloud Computing technologies were indicated as having the greatest effect over the analysed principles, therefore concluding that when applied in the EA scope, these technologies can help organisations improve their EA procedures.","architecture principles, digital transformation, enterprise architecture, technologies, TOGAF",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84881035938}>, <None, {eid: 85123764504}>, <Enterprise architecture – a tool for business innovation realization in the enterprise, {eid: 85123803200}>, <Enterprise architecture: a maturity model based on TOGAF ADM, {eid: 85029453658}>, <The optimum number of principles ideal for enterprise architecture practice, {eid: 85063136627}>, <Mapping the enterprise architecture principles in TOGAF to the cybernetic concepts - an exploratory study, {eid: 84857991004}>, <None, {eid: 85123784373}>, <Guidance on conducting a systematic literature review, {eid: 85060520001}>, <None, {eid: 85123798792}>, <Artificial intelligence, {eid: 84856761210}>, <An interdisciplinary opportunity for information systems research, {eid: 84920288909}>, <Cloud computing – a comprehensive definition, {eid: 85123784975}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Understanding the internet of things: definition, potentials, and societal role of a fast evolving paradigm, {eid: 85009285034}>, <Enterprise systems: state-of-the-art and future trends, {eid: 81255151151}>, <Enterprise architecture for digital transformation, {eid: 85029405540}>, <None, {eid: 51749106819}>, <None, {eid: 84988528496}>, <None, {eid: 84875538777}>, <None, {eid: 84866023843}>, <A comparison of enterprise architecture frameworks, {eid: 78649290453}>, <A framework for information systems architecture, {eid: 85090372254}>, <None, {eid: 70350058952}>, <Analyzing the current trends in enterprise architecture frameworks, {eid: 84893480917}>, <None, {eid: 85123775230}>, <None, {eid: 84929343994}>, <Digital literacy and the digital society, {eid: 78751626734}>, <Industry 4.0: a survey on technologies, applications and open research issues, {eid: 85020118455}>, <Past, present and future of industry 4.0 - a systematic literature review and research agenda proposal, {eid: 85018651607}>, <A capability model for public administration interoperability, {eid: 85094840747}>, <None, {eid: 33750446752}>, <Designing methods of human interface for supervisory control systems, {eid: 0006452717}>, <Using DEMATEL method to analyze the causal relations on technological innovation capability evaluation factors in Thai technology-based firms, {eid: 84912085897}>, <The PROMCALC & GAIA decision support system for multicriteria decision aid, {eid: 0028542026}>, <How to select and how to rank projects: the PROMETHEE method, {eid: 0020702683}>, <Decision making in stock trading: an application of PROMETHEE, {eid: 33750442154}>, <None, {eid: 85123770743}>, <O uso do método PROMETHEE para seleção de candidatos à bolsa-formação do Pronatec, {eid: 84905169310}>, <None, {eid: 85123774611}>, <Cloud computing technologies, {eid: 85072858804}>, <Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: a survey on big data, {eid: 84900800509}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,2022-06-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85123801871

As student feedback is essential to assess the effectiveness of learning technologies, the hidden knowledge of students can be discovered by conducting survey or feedback form or online course satisfaction survey at the end of the courses in order to obtain the meaningful information so that, necessary steps can be taken to improve the learning process.

This study aims to employ hyperspectral imaging technology for the rapid screening and classification of MPs in farmland soil. In this study, a total of 600 hyperspectral data are collected from 180 sets of farmland soil samples with a hyperspectral imager in the wavelength range of 369– 988 nm. To begin, the hyperspectral data are preprocessed by the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing filter and mean normalization. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to minimize the dimensions of the hyperspectral data and hence the amount of data, making the subsequent model easier to construct. The cumulative contribution rate of the first three principal components is reached 98.37%, including the main information of the original spectral data. Finally, three models including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) are established, all of which can achieve well classification effects on three MP polymers including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in farmland soil. By comparing the recognition accuracy of the three models, the classification accuracy of DT and SVM is 87.9% and 85.6%, respectively. The CNN model based on the S-G smoothing filter obtains the best prediction effect, the classification accuracy reaches 92.6%, exhibiting obvious advantages in classification effect. Altogether, these results show that the proposed hyperspectral imaging technique identifies the soil MPs rapidly and nondestructively, and provides an effective automated method for the detection of polymers, requiring only rapid and simple sample preparation.","Convolutional neural network, Hyperspectrum, Machine learning, Microplastics, Rapid identification, Soil",,,,,,,,"<Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing for identification and mapping of wetland vegetation: a review, {eid: 77952881448, doi: 10.1007/s11273-009-9169-z}>, <Hyperspectral image analysis.

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Background: Socioeconomic and health inequalities remain a huge problem in post-apartheid South Africa. Despite substantial efforts at ensuring universal access to vaccines, many children remain under-vaccinated in the country. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with incomplete vaccination in the first year of life, among children aged 12–23 months in South Africa. Methods: The study is a secondary analysis of the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. A multivariable logistic regression model was applied to the data on 708 children aged 12–23 months. The study outcome, vaccination completeness, was assessed using a composite assessment of nine doses of four vaccines; Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) (one dose), Polio (four doses), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP) (three doses) and measles-containing vaccines (MCV) (one dose). Children who received all the nine doses were categorized as completely vaccinated. Independent variables included child, maternal, and demographic characteristics. Variables were included in the model based on literature findings. Bivariate analyses were used to examine the crude association between each independent variable and incomplete vaccination, while the multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the adjusted association after controlling for other variables. Measures of association were presented as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: About two-fifths (40.8%) of the children were incompletely vaccinated. The prevalence of incomplete vaccination was significantly high among children whose mothers did not receive antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy (57.5%), and children living in Gauteng Province (52.2%). From the bivariate analyses, the odds of being incompletely vaccinated were three times higher in children whose mothers did not attend ANC compared with children whose mothers attended ANC (crude OR = 2.93; 95% CI 1.42–6.03). The odds were about three times higher in children living in Mpumalanga province (OR = 2.58; 95% CI 1.27–5.25) and in those living in Gauteng province (OR = 2.76; 95% CI 1.30–5.91), compared with those living in Free State province. Conversely, the odds were 32% lower in children from rich households, compared with those from poor households (OR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.47–0.98). In the adjusted model, the higher odds of incomplete vaccination in children whose mothers did not attend ANC were maintained in both magnitude and direction (adjusted OR [aOR] = 2.87; 95% CI 1.31–6.25). Similarly, compared with children living in Free State province, the higher odds of a child being incompletely vaccinated in Mpumalanga (aOR = 2.30; 95% CI 1.03–5.14) and in Gauteng (aOR = 3.10; 95% CI 1.35–7.15) provinces were maintained in both magnitude and direction. Conclusions: There is a substantial burden of incomplete childhood vaccination in South Africa. Maternal ANC attendance during pregnancy and area of residence significantly influences this burden. Interventions that promote broader health service utilization, such as ANC attendance, can help improve the awareness and uptake of routine childhood vaccination. It is also imperative to take into consideration the provincial disparities in childhood vaccination completeness, in planning and implementing interventions to improve vaccination coverage in the country.","Children, coverage, determinants, factors, incomplete vaccination",,,,,,,,"<global routine vaccination coverage - 2017, {eid: 85056662405, doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6745a2}>, <Progress towards obtaining valid vaccination coverage data in South Africa, {eid: 85066504720, doi: 10.17159/sajs.2019/6060}>, <None, {eid: 84891726528}>, <The health and health system of South Africa: historical roots of current public health challenges, {eid: 69549083506, doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60951-X}>, <Achieving the health millennium development goals for South Africa: challenges and priorities, {eid: 70249111088, doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61122-3}>, <Incomplete childhood immunization in Nigeria: a multilevel analysis of individual and contextual factors, {eid: 85014514976, doi: 10.1186/s12889-017-4137-7}>, <Does it really matter where you live?

All rights reserved.Conservation management and planning often rely on results of ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assist in new population searching, identifying, and prioritizing important biodiversity areas. We use ENM as an accessory appliance in investigation to proceed spatial extrapolation. It not only solves the problem when searching areas are inaccessible but also decreases labor cost and time cost. The study chose Elaeocarpus japonicas (Japanese Elaeocarpus, JE) as target species because JE is a sort of pioneer tree species in second succession of forest ecology. Besides, it is a superior species in middle altitude of Taiwan which widely spread through mountain ridge area and has important implications to ecologists. It used decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), maximum entropy (MAXENT) and discriminant analysis (DA) to develop ecological niche models, which incorporate topographic variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, terrain position (TP), surface curvature (SC), profile curvature (PRC), plan curvature (PLC), and global solar radiation (GSR) in a GIS. Eventually, four terrain-related variables elevation, slope, TP, and GSR were incorporated into the models based on relative importance of all predictor variables. Model calibration and evaluation for these models were implemented efficiently in the ArcGIS and SPSS software and some software modules written by Python. In the model evaluation, RF significantly outperformed (kappa value 0.74) the others with the same result as indicated in previous studies. Followed by DT and MAXENT, DT was nearly on a level with MAXENT (kappa value 0.69 and 0.67, respectively). DA was the worst but still had reasonable performance (kappa value 0.59). The four models accurately predicted the spatial distribution of JEs in Huisun Experimental Forest Station (HEFS), and substantially reduced the distribution area to less than 10% of the entire study area. As a result, they were well suited for spatial distribution modeling of JETs. In the first round of ENM iterative process, they can prioritize either the field-survey areas where it is viable to collect fine spatial-resolution microclimatic, edaphic, or biotic data for refining predictions of potential habitat in later rounds of ENM or search areas for new population discovery under the conditions of limited funding and manpower. After all, it is much difficult to predict the spatial pattern of JE species accurately since it has wide-spread, scattered distribution. Hence, the follow-up study will attempt use high-resolution DEM generated from LiDAR to derive above-mentioned terrain-related variables so that the predictive accuracy of ENMs can be improved substantially.","Decision tree (DT), Ecological niche modeling (ENM), Japanese Elaeocarpus, Maximum entropy (MAXENT), Random forest (RF)",,,,,,,,"<The effect of the extent of the study region on GIS models of species geographic distributions and estimate of niche evolution: preliminary test with montance rodents (genus Nephelomys) in Venezuela, {eid: 77954786550}>, <Five (or so) challenges for species distribution modelling, {eid: 33748529602}>, <Putting a CART before search: successful habitat prediction for a rare forest herb, {eid: 26044476586}>, <None, {eid: 0003802343}>, <Random Forests, {eid: 0035478854}>, <Novel methods improve predictions of species distributions from occurrence data, {eid: 33645917058}>, <MigClim: predicting plant distribution and dispersal in a changing climate, {eid: 63849327366}>, <Future habitat loss and the conservation of plant biodiversity, {eid: 77954814572}>, <What matters for predicting the occurrence of trees: techniques, data, or species characteristics?, {eid: 40349093056}>, <The effect of sample size and species characteristics on performance of different species distribution modeling methods, {eid: 33750352002}>, <Sample size and model comparison metrics for species distribution models, {eid: 84855492766}>, <None, {eid: 0003409580}>, <MAXENT modeling for predicting suitable habitat forthreatened and endangered tree Canacomyrica monticola in New Caledonia, {eid: 77958562051}>, <Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions, {eid: 27944446350}>, <Using hyperspectral remote sensing to detect and quantify southeastern pine senescence effects in redcockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, {eid: 77949487182}>, <Using species distribution models to predict new occurrences for rare plants, {eid: 67149128316}>, <Effect of sample size on the performance of species distribution models, {eid: 49249098476}>, <Application of 3S and Multivariate Statistics to Predict the Potential Habitat of Elaeocarpus Japonicus and Castanopsis carlesii, {eid: 85107196208}>",,,Asian Association on Remote Sensing,,,2020-11-09,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85107198172

To that end, it is important to facilitate decision making in case of unexpected failure by quantifying the uncertain and dynamic nature of the physical phenomena involved. Combining probabilistic and deterministic models is a particularly promising approach to address this issue. In particular, Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) based digital twins are relevant as they embed random variables evolving overtime. Previous research used this modeling method for several applications such as monitoring structural health or manufacturing processes. We envision that the space exploration sector can also benefit from this approach by using the insight gained on specific sub-systems. In this study, we propose lessons learned on the implementation process of PGM-based Digital Twin to quantify uncertainties for temperature prognosis in ECLSS. These findings are introduced as a step-by-step guideline which result in developing a probabilistic model applicable to space habitats. We focused on directed acyclic graphs as this type of PGM can integrate expert's knowledge with data which has been proven to enhance accuracy. A literature review was conducted to identify the state-of-the-art practices and the proposed lessons learned were derived from the study of a physical infrastructure meant to predict the behavior of a space habitat. A temperature control failure scenario was considered, and the Digital Twin estimated the time available before the temperature would become critical. Experiments were conducted on three office rooms to simulate the behavior of an ECLSS. The model was trained offline using historical sensor data and performed inference online by computing the conditional probability of a multivariate normal density. We found that a successful implementation process requires to iteratively go through four stages: outline, design, calibrate and evaluate. It involves selecting ECLSS relevant functionalities and an associated decision-making problem that relies on habitability criteria. Observable variables must be chosen according to a sensors architecture that is compatible with a typical habitat infrastructure. As real space systems are not easily available for model validation, we suggest evaluating early designs on high fidelity analogs. In future work, we envisage to further assess the impact of the design stage on the model's performance by considering computational cost and inference capability.","Digital twin, ECLSS, Probabilistic graphical model, Space habitat",,,,,,,,"<Failure mode and effects analysis for environmental control and life support system self-awareness, {eid: 85097669451}>, <None, {eid: 85152561381}>, <None, {eid: 85152578178}>, <None, {eid: 84880829168, doi: 10.2514/6.2012-1818}>, <Estimation of system states for non-measured parameters and integration with a digital twin framework to boost spacecraft autonomy and awareness, {eid: 85152531788}>, <Digital twin for the structural health management of reusable spacecraft: a case study, {eid: 85085243806, doi: 10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.107076}>, <Hidden Markov model-based digital twin construction for futuristic manufacturing systems, {eid: 85065234372, doi: 10.1017/S089006041900012X}>, <Dynamic Bayesian network for aircraft wing health monitoring digital twin, {eid: 85014566387, doi: 10.2514/1.J055201}>, <A probabilistic graphical model foundation for enabling predictive digital twins at scale, {eid: 85115144191}>, <Ten iterative steps in development and evaluation of environmental models, {eid: 33645947036, doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.01.004}>, <Good practice in Bayesian network modelling, {eid: 84861920466, doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.03.012}>, <Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs, {eid: 0003448310}>, <Probabilistic graphical models: principles and techniques, {eid: 70649111792}>, <Water innovations and lessons learned from water recycling in space, {eid: 85097670201}>, <Detection of conflicting functional requirements in a use case-driven approach, {eid: 0036036781, doi: 10.1145/581352.581355}>, <Maintenance and Repair Task Shortlist for Practical Demonstration, {eid: 85152571161}>, <pgmpy: Probabilistic Graphical Models using Python, {eid: 85049051329, doi: 10.25080/Majora-7b98e3ed-001}>, <None, {eid: 85056871497}>, <PGM_PyLib: a toolkit for probabilistic graphical models in python, {eid: 85152539279}>, <PyGModels: a python package for exploring probabilistic graphical models with graph theoretical structures, {eid: 85152528571, doi: 10.21105/joss.03115}>, <None, {eid: 85152533250}>, <The HUGIN Graphical User Interface — HUGIN GUI 9.2 documentation, {eid: 85152576334}>, <None, {eid: 85064955106}>, <Integration of model verification, validation, and calibration for uncertainty quantification in engineering systems, {eid: 84923253598, doi: 10.1016/j.ress.2015.01.023}>, <None, {eid: 85152514018}>",,,Elsevier Ltd,,,2023-06-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85152517199

In the course of the work, it was revealed that the selection of the spectral transform basis significantly affects the accuracy of the representation of the original model. The proposed method to the decomposition of digital elevation models based on the discrete wavelet transform does not require large computational costs. A technique is proposed for selection the optimal wavelet basis from the position of the minimum mean square error of the reconstructed signal, when quantizing the high-frequency expansion coefficients. Expressions are obtained for generating scaling and wavelet functions in space. The method developed to represent digital elevation models has good properties, which allows to significantly increase the resolution of digital elevation models in the implemented regional geoinformation system.","data visualization, digital elevation models, digital twins, discrete wavelet transform, multiresolution, terrain model, wavelets",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85076922605}>, <Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach to Urban Web Service Databases Evaluation Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process, {eid: 85194088283}>, <Handbook of Research on Developing Smart Cities Based on Digital Twins, {eid: 85194065556}>, <Data Protection of Multimedia Content for E-Learning Using Discrete Wavelet Transform, {eid: 85194057906}>, <None, {eid: 85086260271}>, <Digital Elevation Model Quality Assessment Methods: A Critical Review, {eid: 85094633656, doi: 10.3390/rs12213522}>, <Monitoring Beach Topography and Nearshore Bathymetry Using Spaceborne Remote Sensing: A Review, {eid: 85073479358, doi: 10.3390/rs11192212}>, <Fourier-Bessel series expansion based empirical wavelet transform for analysis of non-stationary signals, {eid: 85044469847}>, <None, {eid: 85161849495}>, <None, {eid: 85159531138}>, <Reviews of bearing vibration measurement using fast Fourier transform and enhanced fast Fourier transform algorithms, {eid: 85060491426, doi: 10.1177/1687814018816751}>, <Representation of Images Using Le Gall Transform, {eid: 85194042079}>, <Application of Wavelet Methods in the Investigation of Geospace Disturbances: A Review and an Evaluation of the Approach for Quantifying Wavelet Power, {eid: 85127452620, doi: 10.3390/atmos13030499}>, <Performance Comparison of First Generation and Second Generation Wavelets in the Perspective of Genomic Sequence Analysis, {eid: 85143681767}>, <Wavelet Transform Application for/in Non-Stationary Time-Series Analysis: A Review, {eid: 85064076348, doi: 10.3390/app9071345}>, <Centralized Wavelet Multiresolution for Exact Translation Invariant Processing of ECG Signals, {eid: 85064841568}>, <Frame-Related Sequences in Chains and Scales of Hilbert Spaces, {eid: 85129146176, doi: 10.3390/axioms11040180}>, <Multi-Resolution Analysis with Visualization to Determine Network Attack Patterns, {eid: 85151493741, doi: 10.3390/app13063792}>, <Medical Image Coding Using Le Gall Transform, {eid: 85194067932}>",,,National Research Nuclear University,,,2024-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85194096411

Production and hosting by Springer Nature.The pavement management system (PMS) consists of several components including data collection, analysis, and reporting procedures. This system helps make decisions about the prioritization of road sections and selecting optimal maintenance strategy for the related road pavement networks. Considering the deteriorating rate of pavement sections and the limited budget and resources, it is important to find the most optimal maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) scenarios for each pavement section. This study presents a model based on the cloud decision tree (CDT) theory for selecting the most optimal M&R strategies. A CDT system is presented for Iran’s national road network. The system includes a general decision-making model and various decision trees for every province of the country. Exclusive decision-making models were presented for freeways, highways, and main roads. Furthermore, different decision tree models are presented based on roads Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). Using the presented theory resulted in a general model with an accuracy of 80%. Evaluation of acquired decision trees showed that fatigue cracking and International Roughness Index (IRI) are the mo st important parameters to determine the appropriate M&R scenarios. Using these parameters provided results close to the re suits of experts’ surveys under real conditions, regardless of rank and traffic volume of the road sections.","Classification, Cloud DT, Maintenance, PMS, Rehabilitation",,,,,,,,"<Pavement management systems lead the way for infrastructure management systems, {eid: 85098618684}>, <Modeling the Pavement Present Serviceability Index of Flexible Highway Pavements Using Data Mining, {eid: 33644622577, doi: 10.3923/jas.2006.193.197}>, <Network-level pavement roughness prediction model for rehabilitation recommendations, {eid: 78651314426, doi: 10.3141/2155-14}>, <Simultaneous network optimization approach for pavement management systems, {eid: 84929208389, doi: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000149}>, <Integration of GIS and data mining technology to enhance the pavement management decision making, {eid: 77953336330, doi: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000092}>, <Jointly optimal policies for pavement maintenance, resurfacing and reconstruction, {eid: 84986896127, doi: 10.1007/s13676-014-0065-1}>, <Optimum analysis of pavement maintenance using multi-objective genetic algorithms, {eid: 85142929217, doi: 10.1016/j.hbrcj.2014.02.008}>, <Multi-objective optimization for asphalt pavement maintenance plans at project level: Integrating performance, cost and environment, {eid: 84943739240, doi: 10.1016/j.trd.2015.09.016}>, <Integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and VIKOR method in the prioritization of pavement maintenance activities, {eid: 84966470712, doi: 10.1016/j.ijprt.2016.03.002}>, <Optimal pavement maintenance programs based on a hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search procedure algorithm, {eid: 84970002389, doi: 10.3846/13923730.2015.1120770}>, <A multi-objective optimization-based pavement management decision-support system for enhancing pavement sustainability, {eid: 85027504439, doi: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.027}>, <A general iterative approach for the system-level joint optimization of pavement maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction planning, {eid: 85042149769, doi: 10.1016/j.trb.2017.09.014}>, <Pavement Maintenance Optimization Strategies for National Road Network in Indonesia Applying Genetic Algorithm, {eid: 85042648531, doi: 10.1016/j.proeng.2017.11.074}>, <Analysis of cost effective pavement treatment and budget optimization for arterial roads in the city of Chattanooga, {eid: 85027339333, doi: 10.1007/s11709-017-0419-5}>, <None, {eid: 84906862181}>, <C5. 0 classification algorithm and application on individual credit evaluation of banks, {eid: 74249089469, doi: 10.1016/S1874-8651(10)60092-0}>, <Comparison of C5. 0 & CART classification algorithms using pruning technique, {eid: 84888197174}>",,,Springer,,,2021-11-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85098659494

These domains are generally strongly heterogeneous and difficult to access; yet their characterization and monitoring still rely mostly on hard-to-perform invasive surveys that provide only point information. These well-known issues, however, can be overcome thanks to the application of minimally invasive methods. In this paper, we present the results of the hydrogeophysical characterization of the Vermigliana Creek's hyporheic and riparian zones, performed at an experimental site in the Adige catchment, northern Italy, by means of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and hydrological modeling. A major advancement is given by the placement of electrodes and of an optical fiber in horizontal boreholes at some depth below the river bed, put in place via directional drilling. The results of this static and dynamic (time-lapse) geophysical characterization identify the presence of two subdomains (the sub-riverbed and the left and right banks) and define the water flow and solute dynamics. The ERT information is then used, together with other hydrological data, to build a 3D subsurface hydrological model (driven mainly by the watercourse stage variations) that is calibrated against local piezometric information. A solute transport model is then developed to reproduce the variations observed in the dynamic geophysical monitoring. The results show good agreement between ERT data and the model outcome. In addition, the transport model is also consistent with the temperature data derived from DTS, even though some slight discrepancies show that the heat capacity of the solid matrix and heat conduction cannot be totally neglected.","Distributed temperature sensing, Electrical resistivity tomography, Flow and transport modeling, Instrumentation under the riverbed, Semi-horizontal boreholes",,,,,,,,"<Heat as a ground water tracer, {eid: 27944495958, doi: 10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.00052.x}>, <Quantity and quality of groundwater discharge in a hypersaline lake environment, {eid: 84896540654, doi: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.02.040}>, <The electrical resistivity log as an aid in determining some reservoir characteristics, {eid: 0001928115}>, <Quantifying hyporheic exchange in a tidal river using temperature time series, {eid: 80053901694, doi: 10.1029/2009WR008365}>, <Tools and techniques: DC electrical methods, {eid: 85042876051, doi: 10.1016/B978-0-444-53802-4.00192-5}>, <R2 code, {eid: 85166879448}>, <DC resistivity and induced polarization methods, {eid: 26844532614}>, <Regularised image reconstruction of noisy electrical resistance tomography data, {eid: 0002996551}>, <Hydrogeophysics: opportunities and challenges, {eid: 78650438167}>, <The emergence of hydrogeophysics for improved understanding of subsurface processes over multiple scales, {eid: 84937517959, doi: 10.1002/2015WR017016}>, <Risposta idrologica di recessione e morfologia della rete di drenaggio, {eid: 85166824996}>, <The functional significance of the hyporheic zone in streams and rivers, {eid: 0032437309, doi: 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.29.1.59}>, <High Resolution In-situ Monitoring of Hyporheic Zone Biogeochemistry.

This data scarcity poses a significant obstacle to inland flood modeling. However, collecting detailed topographic data is demanding, time-consuming, and costly, making remote sensing techniques a promising solution for developing flood inundation analysis models worldwide. This study presents a novel understanding for utilizing topographical elevations obtained using remote sensing techniques to create a flood inundation analysis model. In a study of three watersheds, Kameda, Niitsu, and Shirone (Japan), the assessment of digital terrain models (DTMs) showed that remote sensing-based DTMs (RS-DTMs) exhibited high reliability of coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square errors, compared with the airborne LiDAR-based topography from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan. Comparing the flood modeling results from LiDAR data and RS-DTM, with Kameda and Niitsu performing favorable outcomes, Shirone exhibited less accurate results. We hypothesized that this was caused by the topographic distortions due to lack of evenly distributed reference points. Hence, we revised the topography by adjusting both the slope and intercept from the regression equation. This verification successfully showed that the flood inundation volume correlation improved, achieving R2 results for the three watersheds ranging from 0.975 to 0.997 and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiencies ranging from 0.938 to 0.986 between the resulting flood models based on the LiDAR data and RS-DTM. Based on these findings, we recognized the significance of uniformly distributed geodetic height points. In areas lacking height references, high-precision survey instruments can be employed for achieving uniform distribution.","DTM, Flood inundation model, Remote sensing, Topography",,,,,,,,"<Evaluation of the DTM-2009 thermosphere model for benchmarking purposes, {eid: 84889768704, doi: 10.1051/swsc/2012005}>, <None, {eid: 0003612340}>, <Hydraulic correction method (HCM) to enhance the efficiency of SRTM DEM in flood modeling, {eid: 85042265770, doi: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.056}>, <Assessing the extent of flood-prone areas in a south-American megacity using different high-resolution DTMs, {eid: 85152435064, doi: 10.3390/w15061127}>, <Enhancing digital elevation models for hydraulic modelling using flood frequency detection, {eid: 85053005142, doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2018.08.029}>, <SRTM data Characterization in urban areas, {eid: 67650520384}>, <The latest DEM data (5-meter mesh) , {eid: 85187727583}>, <Reference Point Results Browsing Service Reference points set of Kameda, Niitsu, and Shirone, {eid: 85187758459}>, <Geomorphology of DEMs: Quality assessment and scale effects, {eid: 60349087717}>, <The estimation of R2and adjusted R2in incomplete data sets using multiple imputation, {eid: 69049110853, doi: 10.1080/02664760802553000}>, <About regression-kriging: from equations to case studies, {eid: 34848884281, doi: 10.1016/j.cageo.2007.05.001}>, <Understanding the effects of digital elevation model resolution and building treatment for urban flood modelling, {eid: 85131411258, doi: 10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101122}>, <The latest DTM using InSAR for dynamics detection of Semangko fault-Indonesia, {eid: 85119339294, doi: 10.3846/gac.2021.12621}>, <Integration of the latest digital terrain model (DTM) with Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bathymetry, {eid: 85104523952, doi: 10.15243/jdmlm.2021.083.2759}>, <Utilization of Sentinel Satellite for Vertical Deformation Monitoring in Semangko Fault-Indonesia, {eid: 85105831926}>, <The Updated DTM Model using ALOS PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 Imageries for Dynamic Topography, {eid: 85149214247}>, <Assessment of close-range remote sensing methods for dtm estimation in a lowland deciduous forest, {eid: 85107961036, doi: 10.3390/rs13112063}>, <Flood simulations in mid-latitude agricultural land using regional current and future extreme weathers, {eid: 85075583311, doi: 10.3390/w11112421}>, <Lidar remote sensing for ecosystem studies: lidar, an emerging remote sensing technology that directly measures the three-dimensional distribution of plant canopies, can accurately estimate vegetation structural attributes and should be of particular interest to forest, landscape, and global ecologists, {eid: 0036165976, doi: 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)0520019:lrsfes2.0.co;2}>, <Digital terrain model elevation corrections using space-based imagery and ICESat-2 laser altimetry, {eid: 85112336445, doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2021.112621}>, <Urban flood modelling combining top-view LiDAR data with ground-view SfM observations, {eid: 84949115661, doi: 10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.11.008}>, <Advanced river flood monitoring, modelling and forecasting, {eid: 84941281899, doi: 10.1016/j.jocs.2014.10.004}>, <Accuracy assessment of digital elevation models (DEMs): a critical review of practices of the past three decades, {eid: 85090086253, doi: 10.3390/rs12162630}>, <River flow forecasting through conceptual models: part 1.

Linear rail networks are comprised of connected cyber-physical systems. As the transport sector embraces digital twinning in support of more strategic approaches to asset lifecycle management, requirements management functions must also handle a complex of asset information requirements. High levels of integration in complex project environments present significant challenges for requirements management. Using literature and interview surveys, challenges to requirements management practices are investigated. Findings highlight deficiencies in enterprise-wide requirements management methods and tools, with challenges compounded by deficiencies in consistent requirements modelling, common data models, and interoperable toolchains to support continuous, integrated model-based requirements management workflows. Findings identify opportunities to integrate systems and digital engineering functions through alignment of data and processes, and increase systems engineering expertise to improve requirements

C. Gagula et al.The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is essential in generating the topographic structure of an area by eliminating its external features. Conventional survey techniques are still employed to obtain accurate geographic data on the earth's surface. However, accurate land surveys are now achievable because of the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This study aims to update the LiDAR DTM for Flood Modeling in Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte, using GNSS and UAS integration. The Static GNSS survey was carried out to collect precise points for the direct georeferencing of the DJI Phantom 4 GNSS-RTK UAV. There is a continuous investigation of the influence of flight parameters in creating DTM. Hence, this study also evaluates the effects of overlap percentage and flight altitude on the quality of the generated DTM. There were 16 flight plans prepared using various combinations of flight parameters. The UAS data collected was processed using the Structure from Motion. The quality of the DTM was assessed based on its accuracy and level of completeness to identify the optimal parameters for generating the data model. Based on the results of the accuracy and completeness of the DTMs, the optimal parameters for generating are 90% and 120 meters. Subsequently, the UAS-based DTM generated using this combination of flight parameters was utilized in updating the existing DTM of Las Nieves to create the flood model of the area. The flood model was generated using the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling of the HEC RAS Mapper.","DTM, Flight parameters, Flood Depth Map, Structure from Motion, UAS",,,,,,,,"<Digital Terrain Models Generatedwith Low-Cost UAV Photogrammetry: Methodology and Accuracy, {eid: 85106505392}>, <None, {eid: 85079710304}>, <Assessing the Impacts of Flooding in Tago River Basin, Mindanao, Philippines through Intergration of High Resolution Elevation Datasets, Landsat Image Analysis and Numerical Modelling, {eid: 84964037960}>, <Comparing sUAS Photogrammetrically-Derived Point Clouds with GNSS Measurements and Terrestrial Laser Scanning for Topographic Mapping, {eid: 85079573697}>, <Effect of photogrammetric RPAS flight parameters on plani-altimetric accuracy of DTM, {eid: 85095579151}>, <None, {eid: 85054742522}>, <Point Cloud Generation from Aerial Image Data Acquired by a Quadrocopter Type Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and a Digital Still Camera, {eid: 84856284111}>, <None, {eid: 0142007613}>",,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,,2022-11-14,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85148759412

A total of 270 patients with CS and neck pain recruited in the acupuncture clinic of Shanxi Provincial People’s Hospital were selected as the research objects in this study and were divided into an acupuncture needle group (group A), an acupoint latent acupuncture group (group B), and a puncture bloodletting group (group C) randomly, with 90 cases in each group. The Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPQ), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and Role-Physical (RP), Physiological Function (PF), General Health (GH), and Body Pain (BP) of all patients were recorded before treatment, at the completion of the fifth acupuncture, at the end of treatment, one-month follow-up, two-month follow-up, and three-month follow-up to analyse the clinical treatment effect. Based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, a curative effect evaluation method and data mining model was further established to compare the accuracy rate of data processing by different data models, and the data processed by the data mining model were compared with the clinical data to analyse the feasibility of the data mining model. The test results found that the NPQ and MPQ values of patients in group B were significantly lower than those in groups A and C (P < 0.05). At the end of treatment, the PF and BP values of patients in groups B and C were significantly higher than those of group A (P < 0.05). The RP value of patients in group B was significantly higher than that in groups A and C after treatment and during follow-up (P < 0.05). The GH value of patients in group B was significantly higher than that in groups A and C (P < 0.05). The clinical treatment efficiency in group B was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (P < 0.05). Different sample sizes of decision tree (DT-1), clustering algorithm (CA-1), and support vector machines (SVM-1) had no effect on the accuracy rate of efficacy judgement of the model. Moreover, the accuracy rate of DT-2, CA-2, and SVM-2 using the neighbourhood learning algorithm increased as increase of the sample size. The correct rate of treatment efficiency judgement of the SVM model and the data mining model reached the maximum value of 81.48% and 82.64%, respectively. It suggested that the data mining model based on the ANN algorithm could accurately estimate and evaluate the overall efficacy data of patients with CS and neck pain.","Acupuncture, Artificial neural network algorithm, Cervical spondylosis and neck pain, Data mining technology, Evaluation of clinical treatment efficiency",,,,,,,,"<Cervical spondylotic internal jugular venous compression syndrome, {eid: 85077164824}>, <The role of cervical collar in functional restoration and fusion after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion without plating on single or double levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis, {eid: 85077184066}>, <MRI evidence of brain atrophy, white matter damage, and functional adaptive changes in patients with cervical spondylosis and prolonged spinal cord compression, {eid: 85069736413}>, <Acupuncture therapy in treating migraine: results of a magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging study, {eid: 85046349600}>, <Preliminary clinical evaluation of acupuncture therapy in patients with postpartum sciatica, {eid: 85047843143}>, <A fuzzy logic model for hourly electrical power demand modeling, {eid: 85101179873}>, <CNN based detectors on planetary environments: a performance evaluation, {eid: 85095974189}>, <Wavelet-based EEG processing for epilepsy detection using fuzzy entropy and associative petri net, {eid: 85097354148}>, <Bow Hunters syndrome caused by bilateral dynamic occlusion of the subaxial vertebral arteries during neck extension, {eid: 85126459357}>, <Motion-based activities monitoring through biometric sensors using genetic algorithm, {eid: 85098747859}>, <Pattern recognition approach and clinico-radiological evaluation of compressive myelopathies at a tertiary care hospital, {eid: 85115850804}>, <Spatial pyramid-enhanced NetVLAD with weighted triplet loss for place recognition, {eid: 85065138363}>, <On the estimation and control of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties and noisy outputs, {eid: 85048462505}>, <SOFMLS: online self-organizing fuzzy modified least-squares network, {eid: 72649095852}>, <Self-management of low back pain using neural network, {eid: 85096504933}>, <Nonlinear vibration analysis of sigmoid functionally graded sandwich plate with ceramic-FGM-metal layers, {eid: 85064211609}>, <Prediction of blast-induced air over-pressure in open-pit mine: assessment of different artificial intelligence techniques, {eid: 85060932132}>, <None, {eid: 85115870797}>, <Artificial neural network (ANN) as a tool to reduce human–animal interaction improves senegalese sole production, {eid: 85075714108}>, <Computational neural network in melanocytic lesions diagnosis: artificial intelligence to improve diagnosis in dermatology?, {eid: 85065289137}>, <Artificial neural network for atrial fibrillation identification in portable devices, {eid: 85086830257}>, <Health beliefs, attitudes, and health-related quality of life in persons with fibromyalgia: mediating role of treatment adherence, {eid: 85061302629}>, <tropospheric ozone formation estimation in urban city, Bangi, using artificial neural network (ANN), {eid: 85066954284}>, <Validation of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) in acute low back pain, {eid: 84926419087}>, <Evaluating the high risk groups for suicide: a comparison of logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and artificial neural network, {eid: 84988976141}>, <Participation in active play of children who use lower extremity prostheses: an exploratory questionnaire, {eid: 85045069042}>, <Impact of surgical excision of deep infiltrating bowel endometriosis on health-related quality of life: review of current literature, {eid: 84928170022}>, <The effect of patient characteristics on acupuncture treatment outcomes: an individual patient data meta-analysis of 20,827 chronic pain patients in randomized controlled trials, {eid: 85063540577}>, <Intraoperative motor evoked potential improvement in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: comparison of cortical stimulation parameters, {eid: 85078295513}>, <Does the C3/4 disc play a role in cervical spondylosis with dizziness?

Assessment of the model-based estimation of land-atmosphere carbon flux across various plant functional types (PFTs) can support the accurate identification of the carbon cycle and the adaptation and mitigation of climate change programs. Five different machine learning methods named Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Random Forest (RF) were used to predict daily NEE magnitude. In this study, 24 sites classified into four PFTs of Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF), Evergreen Needle-leaf Forest (ENF), Mixed Forest (MF) and Grassland (GRA) were examined through ground-based flux tower data. The numbers of sites were six, four, six and eight for DBF, ENF, MF and GRA respectively, while measurement periods varied from two to thirteen years. The model calibration and validation were carried out using 70%and 30% of the data-set, respectively. The models’ performances were assessed using statistical indices including the coefficient of determination (R2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), bias error (Bias) and root mean square error (RMSE) through Python software. Based on statistical indices, the models showed different levels of capability when analyzing data from the DBF, ENF, MF and GRA sites. Among the models, RF showed the best performance, MLR showed the poorest performance, while SVM, GBM and DT models all had moderate responses. The effect of both air and soil temperatures, as the state variables, were examined to assess model performance. Whether soil temperature is included in the model plays a more important role in the performance of the models in grassland than in forest. Soil temperature inclusion, as an input variable, improved the models’ performance about 14% in grassland, while it improved performance 2.4%, 2.4% and 3.5% in ENF, MF and DBF, respectively. Finally, to assess the models' performances, the NEE behavior in terms of over- or under- estimation was investigated across each PFT and over various phenological periods. The results indicate that high uncertainty occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the Julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210thdays for grassland.","Carbon fluxes, Eddy

Although several meta-analyses have been conducted to determine first-line combination antiretroviral therapy, this has yet to be confirmed due to the technical limitation associated. In the present study, we applied a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) approach, because it allows integration of information from clinical trials with varying dosing, duration, and sampling time points, resulting in enlargement of available data sources. We performed a bibliographic search to identify clinical trials involving dolutegravir (DTG)-based and efavirenz (EFV)-based regimens in HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve adults, and then identified 30 independent trial data. The time course of drug effect was described by a consecutive first-order kinetic model and analyzed using the nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach. The developed model suggests that the DTG-based regimen provides a faster-acting and more sustainable drug effect than the EFV-based regimen. Moreover, the drug effect tends to appear more slowly and decay faster in severe patients having higher viral load or smaller baseline CD4 count.","Combination antiretroviral therapy, Dolutegravir,

Rinker Sr. School of Construction Management, University of Florida>, <College of Design Construction and Planning, University of Florida>, <Structural Engineering and Construction Management Department, Future University in Egypt>",,"© 2022 The author(s).The emergence of digital twin technology presents tremendous opportunities for several industry sectors. A digital twin is defined as the virtual representation of a physical asset that collects and sends real-time information. A digital twin collects data from the physical asset in real-time and uses this data to create a virtual model of the physical object. Its functionality depends on the bi-directional coordination of data between the physical and virtual models. This is likened to cyber-physical systems, which seek to provide bi-directional coordination between the physical and virtual worlds. While digital twins have found applications in the various industrial sectors such as aerospace, manufacturing, and industrial engineering, their applications in the construction industry are relatively limited. Although some level of progress has been made in the construction industry with the application of a digital twin, it still lags in other sectors. Virtual models of constructed facilities are developed and used to plan and construct the actual facility, with changes in the physical facility being automatically reflected in the virtual model based on real-time data and vice-versa. The digital twin shows promising possibilities in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. This paper reviews the development and implementation of digital twin technology in the construction industry and compares its use with other industries while assessing the benefits of DT to the construction industry. A systematic literature review including a thematic analysis was employed to address the purpose of this study. Limitations associated with the existing and emerging applications are also identified.

Within this context, hydrodynamic modeling can be an important tool for the determination of floodable areas, allowing the estimation of flood quotas for different scenarios of return periods (TR) and project rainfall, thus allowing to more accurately represent reality and minimize errors arising from hydraulic designs. Working with Geographic Information System (GIS), where the channel geometry is extracted using the high precision Digital Terrain Model (DTM) generated by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) survey and hydrodynamic modeling software (HEC-RAS), it was possible to evaluate different flood scenarios in the channeled concrete section, in the Botafogo Stream in Goiânia, Goiás. With the results of hydrodynamic modeling, it was possible to evaluate the propagation behavior of the generated flows, finding that for precipitation with TR 50 years or older, the plumbing limits do not support the generated and transported volumes, causing flooding in six critical stretches. The data obtained by HEC-RAS could be validated from photographic records released by the press and topographic survey of flooded sites, so that the integration between GIS and hydrodynamic modeling proved to be efficient for the study of floodable areas.","hydrological anhydrodynamic modeling, urban drainage, urbanization effects",,,,,,,,"<Modelling rainfall runoff relations using HEC-HMS and

Karazin National University>, <National Aviation University>, <Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research>, <Space Science Institute>",,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdAll available lunar digital elevation models, e.g., SELENE LALT DEM, SELENE DTM LISM, Chang'E-1 LAM DEM, GLD100, SLDEM2015, have certain disadvantages, including insufficient resolution and/or the presence of defects as well as mismatching reference coordinate systems, making it difficult to incorporate the topographic effect on photometric LROC WAC observations. We here propose a photoclinometry technique that can be used to account for this effect. To do so, we modify our algorithm used to construct seamless photometric mosaics (Korokhin et al., PSS 2016, 122, 70–87) to determine local slopes simultaneously with parameters of photometric function during the mosaicing procedure. This technique can be useful for improvement of quality of remote sensing of surfaces with complex topography. We also develop a new algorithm for constructing the lunar digital elevation model based on the simultaneous use of laser altimetric measurements (LRO LOLA) and local longitudinal slopes obtained photoclinometrically from LROC WAC data.

First, the areas that contain buildings are detected using spectral image classification and the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). The classified output provides the shapes and the approximate locations of the buildings. However, those buildings that have similar reflectance values with the other classes were not able to be detected. Therefore, nDSM was generated by subtracting the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the Digital Surface Model (DSM). Next, the buildings were differentiated from the trees by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Areas other than the buildings are excluded from further processing. The buildings that exist in the vector database but missing in the image were detected through analyzing the results of the classification and nDSM. Finally, the buildings constructed after the date of the compilation of the existing vector database were extracted through the proposed model-based approach and the vector database was updated with the new building boundaries. The method was implemented in a selected urban area in Ankara, Turkey using the IKONOS pan-sharpened and panchromatic images. The results show that the proposed approach is quite satisfactory for detecting and delineating the buildings from high resolution space images. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,"<Heuristic filtering and 3d feature extraction from LIDAR data, {eid: 33749571688}>, <None, {eid: 60749134799}>, <Right angle rooftop polygon extraction in regularized urban areas: Cutting the corners, {eid: 28444480961}>, <Detecting buildings in aerial images, {eid: 0023823028}>, <Reliable reconstruction of buildings for digital map revision, {eid: 85036701159}>, <None, {eid: 60749121018}>, <Uncertain reasoning and learning for feature grouping, {eid: 0033341375}>, <A model based approach to semi-automated reconstruction of buildings from aerial images, {eid: 28444431939}>, <Class-guided building extraction from IKONOS imagery, {eid: 0037316579}>, <Building detection and description from a single intensity image, {eid: 0032208694}>, <Recognition and reconstruction of buildings from multiple aerial images, {eid: 0242489413}>, <Model and context-driven building extraction in dense urban aerial images, {eid: 18544365375}>, <Extracting urban features from LIDAR digital surface models, {eid: 0034162143}>, <Generalization of building polygons extracted from IKONOS imagery, {eid: 33747039884}>, <Reconstruction of 3D building models from aerial images and maps, {eid: 1642482500}>, <Fusion of Molocular Cues to Detect Man-Made Structures in Aerial Imagery, {eid: 0027456179}>, <None, {eid: 60749107854}>, <Semiautomated building extraction based on CSG model-image fitting, {eid: 0037312023}>",,,,,,2007-10-10,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-60749136879

We used digital terrain model based on airborne laser scanning data and geophysical measurements (ground penetrating radar GPR and 2-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography ERT), combined with detailed underground mapping, representing a complex multi-faceted approach for resolving karst voids distribution issue. The combination of multisource data allowed us to reconcile the structural control on marbles cavities extent and point out the relationship between cave conduits pattern and topography. LiDAR data allowed analysis of the geomorphological features of slopes and detection of lithological boundaries. ERT inversion models supported a precise imaging of underground conduits levels in the Niedźwiedzia Cave, moreover indicating some potential locations for the new passages ca. 100 -120 m above the Kleśnica Valley floor and farther to the south. Likewise, the GPR method resulted in a satisfactory accuracy of cave chambers detection in the depth range of 15 - 20 metres. Presented methodology resulted in karst voids geophysical imaging, explicitly improving our understanding of the Niedźwiedzia Cave passages distribution, both known ones as well as not recognized nor explored by speleologists hitherto.","Electrical resistivity tomography, Ground penetrating radar, LiDAR DTM, Niedźwiedzia Cave, Sudetes",,,,,,,,"<Analysis of the karst aquifer structure of the Lamalou area (Hérault, France) with ground penetrating radar, {eid: 0036890754}>, <New age and petrological constraints on Lower Silesian basaltoids, SW Poland, {eid: 77649185752}>, <New data on age and petrological properties of Lower Silesian Cenozoic basaltoids, SW Poland, {eid: 33645639364}>, <Extent of the Pleistocene ice sheets and deglaciation between the Sudeten and the Silesian Rampart, {eid: 0032232070}>, <Integration of ground-penetrating radar and microgravimetric methods to map shallow caves, {eid: 0035304934}>, <Niedźwiedzia Cave in the Kletno.

""Planting right tree species at right sites"" can improve tree survival percent, thereby achieving the goal of plantation for carbon reduction. To find right sites for plantation, we attempted to predict the potential habitat of trees accurately by coupling 3S technologies and multivariate statistics. Long-leaf chinkapin (Castanopsis carlesii), whose seeds have long been identified as an important food source for animals in the Huisun study area, was chosen as a target for the study. The study overlaid the tree samples collected with GPS on the layers of vegetation indices derived from SPOT images, elevation, slope, aspect, and terrain position to analyze its spatial distribution by using GIS. Decision tree (DT), logistic multiple regression (LMR), and discriminant analysis (DA) models were developed to predict its potential habitat and evaluate the effect of vegetation indices on model accuracy. Results indicated that SPOT image vegetation indices could not improve the accuracies due to the limits of their spectral resolution and spatial resolution not enough to discriminate the dispersedly distributed species in Huisun. Airborne hyperspectral and LIDAR data will thus be used in follow-up studies to improve model accuracy. Accuracy assessment results also indicated that the accuracies of DT and LMR were nearly equal and much better than that of DA. These models were efficient in implementation of model development and validation. DT and LMR models greatly reduced the area of field survey to less than 10% of the entire study area at the first stage, and thus they were better suited for potential habitat modeling. More importantly, elevation was shown to be one of the most important predictor variables in the models based on spatial distribution analysis of the species.","Decision tree (DT), Discriminant analysis (DA), Geographic information system (GIS), Logistic multiple regression (LMR), Remote sensing, Vegetation index",,,,,,,,"<Putting a CART before search: Successful habitat prediction for a rare forest herb, {eid: 26044476586}>, <Classification and regression trees: A powerful yet simple technique for ecological data analysis, {eid: 0033749212}>, <GIS-based habitat models for mountain goats, {eid: 0036188620}>, <Mapping regional distribution of a single tree species: White bark pine in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, {eid: 50849123033}>, <Utilizing discriminant function analysis with a geographical information system to model ecological succession spatially, {eid: 0026277403}>, <Mapping sagebrush distribution using fusion of hyperspectral and lidar classifications, {eid: 30444444937}>, <Landscape - level models of potential habitat for Sonoran pronghorn, {eid: 22244492338}>, <GIS-based habitat modeling using logistic multiple regression: A study of the Mt.

While its potential as an environmental variable in soil parameter modeling has been investigated for various automated landform delineations, little research has been invested into the relationship between the delineation of landforms by algorithms based on digital terrain models (DTM) and the perception of landforms by the soil surveyor during field work. Five Open Source automated landform classification algorithms and a support vector machine classifier based on single terrain parameters are investigated with regard to their ability to replicate topographic position, at two different scales, as described by surveyors for soil profile sites in the Alpine environment of South Tyrol. We also analyse how the variation of parameters and cell size affects the distribution of the computed landforms. While a clear trend regarding grid cell size and window size can be observed with regard to the difference between macro and meso scale topographic positions, the overall classification accuracy regarding the different topographic position classes was less promising. Although some automated classifications partly resemble the surveyor's classification, a considerable number of issues remain to be investigated in order to explain the lack of reproducibility of surveyor position, some of which are linked to the Alpine environment of the study area. These include the dominance of the backslope position, the objectivity of the surveyor in rugged terrain under forest cover, and the fuzzy nature of classifying topographic position, especially in steep terrain. By applying a forward stepwise feature selection procedure for a model based on single terrain parameters, we show that at macro scale a regional terrain parameter (topographic wetness index) and curvatures at a coarse DTM resolution of 50 m are the most influential in distinguishing topographic position, whereas at meso scale it is the topographic position index (TPI) with a search radius of just 70 m combined with slope gradient. This study is an important first step towards consolidating topographic perception during field survey and digital terrain analysis, which, at least in Alpine terrain, still requires more investigation.","Automated landform classification, Soil profile site description, Soil surveyor, Support vector machine classification, Topographic position",,,,,,,,"<Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung.

Floods are the natural disasters that pose the greatest direct threat to the Czech Republic. They may cause serious critical situations during which not only extensive material damages are incurred, but so too is the loss of human life in affected areas as well as vast devastation of the cultural landscape including environmental damages. The information issued by flood forecasting services about the character and size of flood areas for individual N-year flood discharge events and specific flood scenarios is important for eliminating the potential threats and consequences of such events. Hydrodynamic models provide an adequate image of depths and flow velocities at the longitudinal or cross profiles of the watercourse during a flood event. This is why information obtained from hydrodynamic models occupies a privileged position from the viewpoint of protecting human life and mitigating property damage. Altimetry data are the basic input into hydrodynamic models. One way to obtain such data is through the method of aerial laser scanning (ALS) from the digital terrain model (DTM). This method is considered one of the most accurate methods for obtaining altimetry data. Its major drawback is however its inability to record terrain geometry under water surfaces due to the fact that the laser beam is absorbed by the body of water. The absence of geometric data on watercourse cross sectional area may perceptibly affect results of modelling, especially if the capacity of a missing part of the channel represents a significant cross sectional area. One of the methods for eliminating this deficiency is sufficiently calculating channel depth by means of software tools such as CroSolver. This paper deals with the construction of a hydrodynamic model using fifth generation DTM data and compares outputs from this model at various discharges with a model based on the altimetry data modified using CroSolver. Outputs from the two hydrodynamic models are compared using HEC-RAS software with the use of depth estimate data and with the use of the unmodified DTM. The comparison is done on two watercourse reaches with different terrain morphology and watercourse size. A complementary output is the comparison of inundation areas issuing from both model variants. Our results indicate that differences in the outputs are significant, namely at lower discharges (Q1, Q5), whereas at Q50 and Q100 the difference is negligible with a great role played by the morphology of the modelled area and by the watercourse size.","Aerial laser scanning (ALS), Crosolver, Cross profile - floods, HEC-RAS, Hydrodynamic model",,,,,,,,"<Application of airborne scanning laser altimetry to the study of tidal channel geomorphology, {eid: 0035571573}>, <Projekt tvorby noveho vyškopisu uzemi Česke republiky, {eid: 84877145380}>, <None, {eid: 84982127824}>, <None, {eid: 84982164501}>, <None, {eid: 84982164501}>, <None, {eid: 84879891824}>, <Metodika tvorby map povodnoveho nebezpeči a povodnovych rizik, {eid: 84982164504}>, <Micro-scale flood risk analysis based on detailed 2d hydraulic modelling and high resolution geographic data, {eid: 78049329155}>, <None, {eid: 0142007613}>, <Application of airborne lidar in river environments: The river coquet, {eid: 0037353941}>, <Quasi-2d approach in modeling the transport of contaminated sediments in floodplains during river flooding.

It consists of an Early to Middle Pliocene succession including essentially shelf pelites. In the Radicofani area, province of Siena (Tuscany region), morphodynamic processes are very frequent with widespread badlands and rapidly evolving mudflows. In order to evaluate the general instability of the Radicofani area, geological and geomorphological surveys were carried out. The 1954, 1990 and 2003 aerial surveys allowed a comparison of the changes in the various morphological aspects of the study area, which suggested an increase in slope instability with time. A new complex translational landslide evolving into mudflows, activated during the winter of 2003, was monitored using an experimental system based on terrestrial LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and GPS (Global Positioning System) technologies. This system allowed the monitoring of the morphologic and volumetric evolution of the landslide. A comparison of the monitoring data of October 2004, June 2005, May 2006 and May 2007 points out that the evolution is characterised by the sliding of displaced materials. A volume of about 1300 m3 of materials was removed during the period 2004-2005, 300 m3 for 2005-2006, and 400 m3 for 2006-2007. The greater initial mass movement probably reflects a greater static imbalance during the early period of landslide movement and increased rainfall. Therefore, the proposed monitoring system methodology allows the numerical evaluation of the landslide morphological evolution and to validate the landslide evolution model based on geological and geomorphological field surveys. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Examinees were divided into 7 ages groups. The mean value of present teeth at each age group was calculated. Age dependency of number of teeth was investigated with a kinetic model based on the following premise. 1. Changes between age groups can be treated as a time series occurrence. 2. Number of missing teeth can be estimated as 29 - that of present teeth. Results show that the rate of decrease of the number of present teeth is of a first order in itself and the number of missing teeth. It can be mathematically expressed as follows: -dX/dt = k.X.(29 - X).......eq. (1). in which X = number of present teeth, 29 - x = number of missing teeth k = rate constant, t = time. From this simple relationship the following are suggested 1. Tooth loss is caused by the interaction of present teeth and sites where teeth are lost. 2. Integration of eq. (1) yields ln¿(29 - X)/X¿ = 29.k.t + a.......eq. (2). in which 0 < X < 29, t = time from the youngest age group (20-29), a = constant. It appears that, from eq. (2), the dental health of a community is determined by two coefficients, 29.k and a. 3. Helping a person realize his present and future dental state and to motivate action for prevention of tooth loss by showing him his rate of decrease, ""tooth age"" and the predicted number of teeth a certain years later calculated from eq. (1) and eq. (2), can be of great value. 4. Eq. (2) is transformed to X = 29/¿exp(29.k.t + a) + 1¿, which represents the reverse S-shaped curve of the age dependency of the number of teeth. 5. Applying this method to cohort analysis will enable forecast of the trend of the number of teeth.",,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,1997-01-01,9553383,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-0031317699

While it is true that a systematic use of Design Thinking (DT) throughout the curriculum would certainly improve the situation, a different approach is clearly needed, most likely an approach that combines DT with gamification, and that makes optimal use of project-based learning (PBL) using agile methods. In order to refine and clarify our possible contribution on the conjunction of such perspectives, we conducted an initial literature review that validated our objectives. Complementarily, we also defined a roadmap to transform such intentions into practical actions towards the creation of a new game development model based on DT principles.

Unfortunately, the state-space explosion problem of classical model-checking algorithms affects also quantitative extensions. Mean-field techniques provide approximations of the mean behaviour of large population models. These approximations are deterministic: a unique value of the fractions of agents in each state is computed for each time instant. A drastic reduction of the size of the model is obtained enabling the definition of an efficient model-checking algorithm. This paper is a survey of work we have done in the last few years in the area of mean-field approximated probabilistic model-checking. We start with a brief description of FlyFast, an on-the-fly model checker we have developed for approximated bounded PCTL model-checking, based on mean-field population DTMC approximation. Then we show an example of use of FlyFast in the context of Collective Adaptive Systems. We also discuss two additional interesting front-ends for FlyFast; the first one is a translation from CTMC-based population models and (a fragment of) CSL that allows for approximate probabilistic model-checking in the continuous stochastic time setting; the second one is a translation from a predicate-based process interaction language that allows for probabilistic model-checking of models based on components equipped both with behaviour and with attributes, on which predicates are defined that can be used in component interaction primitives.","Collective adaptive systems, Discrete time

All rights reserved.For an extension of the water catchments areas for the Greater Istanbul Municipality investigations in a mountainous forest area in Turkey, at the Bulgarian border, named Istiranca, have been made. In the project area a height model from SPOT-5 HRS, the SRTM C-band height model and a digital elevation model (DEM) for the topographic map 1:25 000 are available like also a Cartosat-1 stereo pair. For comparison a SPOT-5 HRS height model has been checked in Istanbul vicinity against a reference DEM from more accurate maps 1:5000 and also the SRTM C-band height model.Based on the Cartosat-1 stereo pair a digital surface model (DSM) has been generated by automatic image matching. For the orientation of the Cartosat-1 images control points from the topographic map 1:25 000 have been used, leading in the average to RMSX=6.78m, RMSY=7.11m and RMSZ=6.08m. This accuracy is dominated by the limited control point quality, but with the 14 well distributed control points a satisfying orientation can be guaranteed. The automatic matching by least squares resulted in an astonishing complete coverage of the area by matched points. The matching failed only in small sub-areas covered by clouds. In the forest, not influenced by clouds, more than 98% of the possible object points have been matched successfully with correlation coefficients above 0.5 and with a maximum of the correlation coefficients in the range of 0.85. For mountainous forest areas this is an unusual good result. The matching was made for every third pixel, leading to a point spacing of approximately 7.5m. SRTM C-band and the results from image matching with optical images lead to DSMs, including the height of the visible surface, while the reference height model from the topographic map 1:25 000 refers to the bare ground. The SRTM height model is available with a spacing of 3 arcsec, including only limited morphologic details. All the height models have been compared to each other. A strange correspondence of the SPOT-5 HRS height model to the SRTM Cband height model can be seen, which only can be explained by filling the gaps in the SPOT-5 HRS height model in the forest area by SRTM C-band data.","Databases, DEM/DTM, Digital, Modelling, Satellite",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85044470197}>, <None, {eid: 85044468632}>, <ISPRS-ISRO Cartosat-1 Scientific Assessment Programme (C-SAP) Technical report-test areas Mausanne and Warsaw, {eid: 45849141085}>, <DEM generation with Cartosat-1stereo imagery EARSel, {eid: 84924266503}>, <Accuracy analysis of SRTM height models, {eid: 84868616892}>",,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,,2008-07-03,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85024182393

Again the interactions among multiple classes are neglected. Moreover the different route choice rules to different users are hardly considered. Therefore, a multi-class analytical DTA model is proposed in this paper. The user classes typically refer to different classes whose route choice rules are different, such as dynamic system optimization, dynamic user equilibrium, and stochastic dynamic user equilibrium. According to travel time characteristic of each user class, the multidimensional travel time function based on the extended BPR function is built which can satisfy FIFO requirement and express the asymmetric interactions among user classes. At the same time, the interdependences among user classes are modeled based on bilevel programming, and the solution algorithm on bi-level model is designed using iterative optimization algorithm. Finally, the model is applied to the experimental network.","Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), Iterative optimization, Multiple user-classes, Route choice rules",,,,,,,,"<Dynamic traffic assignment for urban road networks, {eid: 0026072854}>, <Quasi-variational inequality formulation of the multiclass dynamic traffic assignment problem, {eid: 0038743105}>, <Multiclass dynamic traffic assignment model: Formulation and computational experiences, {eid: 0030287560}>, <Multiple user classes real-time traffic assignment for on-line operations: A rolling horizon solution framework, {eid: 0002302632}>, <A link-based variational model for dynamic departure time/route choice, {eid: 0029751356}>, <A comparison of system optimum and user equilibrium dynamic traffic assignments with schedule delays, {eid: 0029477012}>, <Modeling dynamic transportation networks: An intelligent transportation system oriented approach, {eid: 0003698744}>, <None, {eid: 70350500289}>, <The traffic assignment problem: Models and methods, {eid: 74049122518}>, <None, {eid: 8744252091}>",,,,,,2009-05-21,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-74049120383

LiDAR generated digital elevation models (DEM) and wet areas mapping (WAM) provided data at a 1 m resolution for the study area in Alberta. Six different catchment areas (CA), ranging from 0.5 ha to 10 ha, were tested to reveal optimal CA for calculation of the depth-to-water (DTW) index from WAM. Using different modeling methods, species-specific SI models were developed for three datasets: (1) topographic and wet area variables derived from DEM andWAM, (2) onlyWAM variables, and (3) field measurements of soil and topography. DTW was selected by each statistical method for each species and, in most cases, DTW was the strongest predictor in the model. In addition, differences in strength of relationships were found between species. Models based on remotely-sensed information predicted SI with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.6 m for aspen and lodgepole pine, and 2 m for white spruce. This approach appears to adequately portray the variation in productivity at a fine scale and is potentially applicable to forest growth and yield modeling and silviculture planning.","Boreal forests, Depth-to-water index, Forest productivity, Site index",,,,,,,,"<Forest site productivity: A review of the evolution of dendrometric concepts for even-aged stands, {eid: 41149160909}>, <Sitka spruce site index in response to varying soil moisture and nutrients in three different climate regions in Ireland, {eid: 80055003463}>, <Predicting forest site productivity in temperate lowland from forest floor, soil and litterfall characteristics using boosted regression trees, {eid: 84860178067}>, <Near-surface soil characteristics and understory plants as predictors of Pinus contorta site index in southwestern Alberta, Canada, {eid: 0037451683}>, <Predicting Loblolly Pine Site Index from Soil Properties Using Partial Least-Squares Regression, {eid: 84982903003}>, <Comparison and ranking of different modelling techniques for prediction of site index in Mediterranean mountain forests, {eid: 77349088324}>, <Effect of topography and geology on the site index of Picea abies in theWest Carpathian, Poland, {eid: 45749133084}>, <Lodgepole pine site index in relation to synoptic measures of climate, soil moisture and soil nutrients, {eid: 12244278567}>, <Climate sensitive site index models for Norway, {eid: 84971655283}>, <Linking climate, gross primary productivity, and site index across forests of the western United States, {eid: 80051764844}>, <Predicting lodgepole pine site index from climatic parameters in Alberta, {eid: 33746863331}>, <Predictive approaches to forest site productivity: Recent trends, challenges and future perspectives, {eid: 84892748436}>, <A GIS-derived integrated moisture index to predict forest composition and productivity of Ohio forests (U.S.A.), {eid: 0000071031}>, <How do biophysical factors contribute to height and basal area development in a mixed multiaged coast redwood stand?, {eid: 84964754377}>, <Predicting the site index of sugi plantations from GIS-derived environmental factors in Miyazaki Prefecture, {eid: 34249738152}>, <Effects of topography and thickness of organic layer on productivity of black spruce boreal forests of the canadian clay belt region, {eid: 84905368738}>, <Using the Cartographic Depth-to-Water Index to Locate Small Streams and AssociatedWet Areas across Landscapes, {eid: 84874421459}>, <Topographic modelling of soil moisture conditions: A comparison and verification of two models, {eid: 58549089927}>, <Modelling and mapping topographic variations in forest soils at high resolution: A case study, {eid: 79959333438}>, <Evaluating digital terrain indices for soil wetness mapping-A Swedish case study, {eid: 84907794713}>, <Linking the Depth-to-Water Topographic Index to Soil Moisture on Boreal Forest Sites in Alberta, {eid: 84962467976}>, <Modeling and mapping vegetation type by soil moisture regime across boreal landscapes, {eid: 84874444708}>, <Fine-spatial scale predictions of understory species using climate-and LiDAR-derived terrain and canopy metrics, {eid: 84940359833}>, <Remote sensing proxies of productivity and moisture predict forest stand type and recovery rate following experimental harvest, {eid: 84941585421}>, <Development and evaluation of a biomass increment-based index for site productivity, {eid: 85013878010}>, <Modeling forest site productivity using mapped geospatial attributes within a South Carolina Landscape, USA, {eid: 85032857357}>, <ClimateWNA-high-resolution spatial climate data for western North America, {eid: 84862907547}>, <None, {eid: 0003819786}>, <None, {eid: 85042766081}>, <A Growth and Yield Projection System (GYPSY) for Natural and Post-harvest Stands in Alberta.

All rights reserved.Train delay is one of the biggest challenges that is faced by the railway systems across the globe. The mechanism used to predict the train delay is based on a lot of factors that are directly or indirectly linked to delay of trains. They rely on the rules that are made by the experts of railway systems that are based on univariate statistics. There has been an increased interest in the application of advanced data analytics to solve train specific problems such as maintenance of railway assets, automatic visual inspection systems, network area estimation, energy efficient railway operations. Prediction of failures by most of the existing methods is done by comparing the current or computed values with a set of standard values. A few proposed methods are based on: Fuzzy rules and the univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, Graph topology, scheduling algorithms for PROFINET and MVB, the adaptive iterative learning control (AILC) mechanism and Markov model based methods. This paper presents a survey of the existing train delay detection techniques.","AILC, ARIMA, DFS, DTDPS, HDFS, QOS, SPN, ST Maps",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85071950884}>, <None, {eid: 85071943729}>, <None, {eid: 85071952140}>, <None, {eid: 85071938046}>, <None, {eid: 85071924829}>, <None, {eid: 85071931532}>, <None, {eid: 85071957403}>, <None, {eid: 85071928015}>, <None, {eid: 85071927270}>",,,"Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.",,,2019-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85071943302

Here, we present the study of a complex volcanic system, located in the Chaîne des Puys volcanic field (French Massif Central, France) and centred on the Puy de Dôme volcano, an 11,000 years old volcano. Our approach is based on a morpho-structural analysis of a high resolution DTM (0.5 m) and geophysical imaging methods. Both gravity and magnetic high resolution surveys have been carried out on the lava dome and the nearby volcanic structures. We computed 3D inverse and 2D forwards models. Based on our current knowledges about volcanic dome structure, the geophysical models allow us to propose a synthetic geological model of the inner structure of the Puy de Dôme and surrounding areas.

An area of 889.33 km2 was chosen in the Northern region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The soil-landscape relationship was obtained from reambulation of the studied area and the alignment of the units in the 1:50,000 scale topographic mapping. Six predictive covariates linked to the factors soil formation, relief and organisms, together with data sets of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % of the total data volume, were used to generate the predictive DT models in the data mining program Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). In this study, sample densities below 5 % resulted in models with lower power of capturing the complexity of the spatial distribution of the soil in the study area. The relation between the data volume to be handled and the predictive capacity of the models was best for samples between 5 and 15 %. For the models based on these sample densities, the collected field data indicated an accuracy of predictive mapping close to 70 %.","Decision tree, Mapping unit, Pedometry, Soil survey",,,,,,,,"<A strategy to fill gaps in soil survey over large spatial extents: An example from the Murray-Darling basin of Australia, {eid: 0037225419}>, <Data mining to infer soil-landscape relationships in digital soil mapping, {eid: 77953653351}>, <A review of assessing the accuracy of classification of remotely sensed data, {eid: 0026278621}>, <None, {eid: 0041842854}>, <None, {eid: 77954159222}>, <Decision trees for digital soil mapping on subtropical basaltic steeplands, {eid: 79955462252}>, <Superficial and subterranean soil erosion in Tabasco, tropical Mexico: Development of a decision tree modeling approach, {eid: 34247482308}>, <Extrapolating regional soil landscapes from an existing soil map: Sampling intensity, validation procedures, and integration of spatial context, {eid: 38049042366}>, <Multi-criteria characterization of recent digital soil mapping and modeling approaches, {eid: 68749119346}>, <None, {eid: 77956394469}>, <Methods to interpolate soil categorical variables from profile observations, {eid: 34447527460}>, <None, {eid: 77957010658}>, <Predictive mapping of soil organic carbon in wet cultivated lands using classificationtree based models: The case study of Denmark, {eid: 77649271459}>, <Spatial soil zinc content distribution from terrain parameters: A GIS-based decision-tree model in Lebanon, {eid: 74249083880}>, <Spatial soil information systems and spatial soil inference systems: Perspectives for digital soil mapping, {eid: 70349258840}>, <Extrapolation at regional scale of local soil knowledge using boosted classification trees, {eid: 84857087214}>, <On digital soil mapping, {eid: 0347447325}>, <None, {eid: 77950918015}>, <Knowledge discovery from soil maps using inductive learning, {eid: 0242485179}>, <The application of classification tree analysis to soil type prediction in a desert landscape, {eid: 7044232084}>, <Multivariate analysis applied to reduce the number of predictors in digital soil mapping, {eid: 80052526704}>, <Digital terrain analysis, {eid: 0002003252}>, <None, {eid: 0003957032}>",,,,,,2013-06-17,,por,Journal,2-s2.0-84878841156

Most traditional mode choice models are based on the principle of random utility maximization derived from econometric theory. Alternatively, mode choice modeling can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem in which multiple human behavioral patterns reflected by explanatory variables determine the choices between alternatives or classes. The capability and performance of two emerging pattern recognition data mining methods, decision trees (DT) and neural networks (NN), for work travel mode choice modeling were investigated. Models based on these two techniques are specified, estimated, and comparatively evaluated with a traditional multinomial logit (MNL) model. For comparison, a unique three-layer formulation of the MNL model is presented. The similarities and differences of the models' mechanisms and structures are identified, and the mechanisms and structures in the models' specifications and estimations are compared. Two performance measures, individual prediction rate and aggregate prediction rate, which represent the prediction accuracies for individual and mode aggregate levels, respectively, were applied to evaluate and compare the performances of the models. Diary data sets from the San Francisco, California, Bay Area Travel Survey 2000 were used for model estimation and evaluation. The prediction results show that the two data mining models offer comparable but slightly better performances than the MNL model in terms of the modeling results, while the DT model demonstrates the highest estimation efficiency and most explicit interpretability, and the NN model gives a superior prediction performance in most cases.",,,,,,,,,"<Conditional Logit Analysis of Qualitative Choice Behavior, {eid: 0002297105}>, <Alternative Nested Logit Models: Structure, Properties and Estimation, {eid: 0032083791}>, <Discrete Choice Modeling for Transportation, {eid: 0242431854}>, <Bayesian Analysis of Logit Models Using Natural Conjugate Priors, {eid: 38249002403}>, <A Bayesian Analysis of Nested Logit Models, {eid: 0038551318}>, <Identifying Decision Structures Underlying Activity Patterns: An Exploration of Data Mining Algorithms, {eid: 0034432792}>, <Tree Induction of Spatial Choice Behavior, {eid: 0034433587}>, <Drivers Route Choice Behavior: Analysis by Data Mining Algorithms, {eid: 0036963117}>, <Exploration of Route Choice Behavior with Advanced Traveler Information Using Neural Network Concepts, {eid: 0027721341}>, <A Comparison of the Predictive Potential of Artificial Neural Networks and Nested Logit Models for Commuter Mode Choice, {eid: 0034286954}>, <Nested Logit Models and Artificial Neural Networks for Predicting Household Automobile Choices: Comparison of Performance, {eid: 0036959642}>, <None, {eid: 0003577150}>, <None, {eid: 0004185151}>, <None, {eid: 0003802343}>, <None, {eid: 0003500248}>, <None, {eid: 0003631556}>, <None, {eid: 0003433293}>, <Evaluation of Artificial Neural Network Applications in Transportation Engineering, {eid: 0003024620}>, <A Review of Neural Networks Applied to Transport, {eid: 0029485810}>, <None, {eid: 0003593041}>, <None, {eid: 1942540306}>, <None, {eid: 85173170725}>, <Artificial Neural Networks for Freeway Incident Detection, {eid: 0029332504}>, <Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation, {eid: 0003444646}>, <None, {eid: 0003507803}>",,,National Research Council,,,2003-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-1942472940

Although the SDQ is available in both paper and computer survey formats, cross-format equivalences have yet to be established. The current study aimed to assess the measure’s equivalence across paper- and computer-based survey formats in a community-based school setting. The study examined self-reported measures completed by a matched sample of 11–14 year olds in secondary schools in England (589 completed paper version; 589 online version). Analyses demonstrate that the factor structure, although did not vary by survey format, resulted in poorly fitting models limiting the use of model based invariance testing. Results indicate that the measure does not operate similarly across different formats, with scale-level mean differences observed for the hyperactivity scale, which also affects the total difficulties score, with higher scores seen in the paper version. Responses to the impact supplement were also influenced by survey format, with higher impact in specific domains disclosed on the computer-based measure. Item-level differential item functioning was observed for four items in the measure; two from the prosocial scale where the DIF is large enough to affect the scale (DTF, ν2 = 0.14). The inconsistency across survey formats highlights the need for more assessment of influences of different survey formats on young people, their perceived privacy and their mental health disclosures via different media. The findings also highlight the potential confounding effect of format when different methods of data collection are used, with a potentially substantive impact on cross-sample comparisons and within child clinical review.","Computer, DIF, Format effects, Psychometric properties, SDQ, Validation",,,,,,,,"<Multicultural assessment of child and adolescent psychopathology with ASEBA and SDQ instruments: research findings, applications, and future directions, {eid: 40449112527}>, <None, {eid: 0003600480}>, <Matching, {eid: 84970857479}>, <None, {eid: 84973628648}>, <None, {eid: 81255141802}>, <Our children deserve better: prevention pays, {eid: 84973665203}>, <From alpha to omega: a practical solution to the pervasive problem of internal consistency estimation, {eid: 84904050392}>, <Mental health difficulties in early adolescence: a comparison of two cross-sectional studies in England from 2009 to 2014, {eid: 84928005683}>, <The factor structure of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) in Greek adolescents, {eid: 71049133002}>, <Strengths and difficulties questionnaire as a dimensional measure of child mental health, {eid: 68549126919}>, <The strengths and difficulties questionnaire: a research note, {eid: 0030793982}>, <The strengths and difficulties questionnaire: a pilot study on the validity of the self-report version, {eid: 0031786713}>, <Comparing the strengths and difficulties questionnaire and the child behavior checklist: is small beautiful ?, {eid: 0032956218}>, <The psychometric properties of the self-reported SDQ–an analysis of Swedish data based on the rasch model, {eid: 34447262613}>, <Görzig, A.,..

Furthermore, the representation core of the system has the ability to work with multiple topological data structures from which can be extracted, in constant time, all the connectivity relations between the entities vertices, edges and faces existing in a planar triangulation what helps enormously the implementation for real time applications.

DTMs can be produced from a variety of data types including photogrammetric, surveying, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. The availability and popularity of the LiDAR systems, which produce high intensity point clouds require the development of robust techniques for the retrieval, display, and analysis of the data model. This article presents a method based on cubic convolution for robust scale-space representation of DTMs created from LiDAR data. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A Cellular Automata Model, based on the dilatant fluid constitutive law, and two different Digital Terrain Models(DTM) were employed. The first simulations were performed with a DTM dated 1999 (grid10 × 10 m) and reproducing the site topography before the events. The other simulations were carried out with a DTM dated 2011 (from Light Detection and Ranging surveys) with a grid5 × 5 m. Although the results obtained with a post event DTM can be affected by morphological changes, however the agreement with in site evidences seems to be more consistent. The rheological parameters calibrated with back analyses for the two DTMs are different. These results seem to indicate the influence of the topography accuracy for the calibration of the rheological parameters .","Cellular Automata Model, Debris Flow, DTM, Numerical Modeling, Rheological Parameters",,,,,,,,"<Experiments on a gravity-free dispersion of large solid spheres in a newtonian fluid under shear, {eid: 0002902651}>, <Laboratory granular flows generated by slope failures, {eid: 39749172341}>, <Physical and numerical models to rehabilitate a waste disposal site, {eid: 39749122390}>, <The evolutive mechanism of debris flows: Analysis and protection works, {eid: 39749181276}>, <Debris flow analysis: From lithological classification of the basin to deposition, {eid: 84898074526}>, <Cellular automaton for realistic modelling of landslides, {eid: 84984402947}>, <Mechanical characteristics of debris flow, {eid: 0018004798}>, <None, {eid: 0005229320}>, <Quantitative basin characterization to refine debris-flow triggering criteria and processes: An example from the italian western alps, {eid: 39349086755}>",,,Springer International Publishing,,,2015-01-01,,eng,Book,2-s2.0-84944607138

To reduce the acquisition time, a novel model-based reconstruction for simultaneous multislice (SMS) and parallel imaging (PI) accelerated iEPI DTI is proposed. Materials and methods: DTI datasets acquired by iEPI with SMS and PI acceleration can be regarded as 3D k-space data, which is undersampled along both the slice and phase encoding directions. Instead of reconstruction of individual diffusion-weighted image, diffusion tensors are directly estimated by the joint reconstruction of undersampled 3D k-space from all diffusion-encoding directions using a model-based formulation to exploit the correlation across different directions. DTI simulation and in vivo acquisition were used to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Results: The proposed method reduced the estimation errors and artifacts than traditional parallel imaging reconstruction in DTI simulation. In the in vivo DTI experiment, the acquisition time of 4-shot iEPI was reduced from 11 min 7 s to 3 min 53 s with an acceleration factor of 4, and the image quality and precision of quantitative parameters were comparable with the fully sampled acquisition. Conclusions: The proposed model-based reconstruction for iEPI DTI with SMS and PI can achieve fourfold acceleration while maintaining high accuracy for tensor measurements.","diffusion tensor imaging, high-resolution DTI, interleaved EPI, model-based reconstruction, simultaneous multislice",,,,,,,,"<MR diffusion tensor spectroscopy and imaging, {eid: 0028154030}>, <Three-dimensional tracking of axonal projections in the brain by magnetic resonance imaging, {eid: 0033007902}>, <Diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-tensor imaging, and fiber tractography of the spinal cord, {eid: 65349183421}>, <Simultaneous multislice echo planar imaging with blipped controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration: a promising technique for accelerated diffusion tensor imaging of skeletal muscle, {eid: 84931838289}>, <Analysis of T2 limitations and off-resonance effects on spatial resolution and artifacts in echo-planar imaging, {eid: 0025298010}>, <SENSE: sensitivity encoding for fast MRI, {eid: 0032712873}>, <Improved diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in stroke using sensitivity encoding (SENSE), {eid: 0034850918}>, <Diffusion tensor imaging using single-shot SENSE-EPI, {eid: 0036290659}>, <Generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA), {eid: 0036263907}>, <Self-feeding MUSE: a robust method for high resolution diffusion imaging using interleaved EPI, {eid: 84914811143}>, <Diffusion-weighted interleaved echo-planar imaging with a pair of orthogonal navigator echoes, {eid: 0029866438}>, <Blipped-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging for simultaneous multislice echo planar imaging with reduced g-factor penalty, {eid: 84859705233}>, <Improved multi-shot diffusion imaging using GRAPPA with a compact kernel, {eid: 84971617572}>, <A robust multi-shot scan strategy for high-resolution diffusion weighted MRI enabled by multiplexed sensitivity-encoding (MUSE), {eid: 84873702566}>, <Sparse MRI: the application of compressed sensing for rapid MR imaging, {eid: 36849088522}>, <A model-based reconstruction for undersampled radial spin-echo DTI with variational penalties on the diffusion tensor, {eid: 84924049592}>, <Model-based reconstruction of undersampled diffusion tensor k-space data, {eid: 84881160013}>, <Direct diffusion tensor estimation using a model-based method with spatial and parametric constraints, {eid: 85015582536}>, <Simultaneous multislice accelerated interleaved EPI DWI using generalized blipped-CAIPI acquisition and 3D K-space reconstruction, {eid: 84964336958}>, <Nonlinear total variation based noise removal algorithms, {eid: 44049111982}>, <Fully 3D Bayesian image reconstruction for the ECAT EXACT HR+, {eid: 0032096153}>, <Three-dimensional Fourier encoding of simultaneously excited slices: generalized acquisition and reconstruction framework, {eid: 84900796823}>, <2D-GRAPPA-operator for faster 3D parallel MRI, {eid: 33845270221}>, <DtiStudio: resource program for diffusion tensor computation and fiber bundle tracking, {eid: 31344441424}>, <The B-matrix must be rotated when correcting for subject motion in DTI data, {eid: 67049116294}>, <Optimized diffusion gradient orientation schemes for corrupted clinical DTI data sets, {eid: 33747093020}>, <High b-value q-space analyzed diffusion-weighted MRS and MRI in neuronal tissues–a technical review, {eid: 0036869883}>, <Extracting geometric properties of white matter with q-space diffusion MRI (QSI), {eid: 84954243906}>, <Whole-brain quantitative diffusion MRI at 660 μm resolution in 25 minutes using gSlider-SMS and SNR-enhancing joint reconstruction, {eid: 85049774756}>, <Coil compression for accelerated imaging with Cartesian sampling, {eid: 84872910908}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,2018-07-01,29758101,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85049786964

As a result of the 'wilding' concept implemented in the National Park Bavarian Forest, this area is one of the refuges for the species in Germany. Even though the effects of prevailing processes make the situation there particularly interesting, no recent investigation about habitat selection in the rapidly changing environment of the national park has been undertaken. We modelled the species-habitat relationship to derive the important habitat features in the national park as well as factors and critical threshold for monitoring, and to evaluate the predictive power of models based on field surveys compared to an analysis of infrared aerial photographs. We conducted our surveys on 49 plots of 25 ha each where Hazel Grouse was recorded and on an equally sized set of plots with no grouse occurrence, and used this dataset to build a predictive habitat-suitability model using logistic regression with backward stepwise variable selection. Habitat heterogeneity, stand structure, presence of mountain ash and willow, root plates, forest aisles, and young broadleaf stands proved to be predictive habitat variables. After internal validation via bootstrapping, our model shows an AUC value of 0.91 and a correct classification rate of 87%. Considering the methodological difficulties attached to backward selection, we applied Bayesian model averaging as an alternative. This multi-model approach also yielded similar results. To derive simple thresholds for important predictors as a basis for management decisions, we alternatively ran tree-based modelling, which also leads to a very similar selection of predictors. Performance of our different survey approaches was assessed by comparing two independent models with a model including both data resources: one constructed only from field survey data, the other based on data derived from aerial photographs. Models based on field data seem to perform slightly better than those based on aerial photography, but models using both predictor datasets provided the highest predictive accuracy. © Dt.

We used available digital terrain model (DTM) based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology to map relics of mining activities in West Bohemia. The Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre started in 2008 project for terrain mapping using the ALS method. The aim of mapping was to get authentic and detailed DTM of the Czech Republic. About 2/3 of area is currently covered by the DTM based on ALS, this year the mapping should be complete. The dataset is characterised by the density of 1-2 points/m2 and the standard deviation in altitude of model points is up to 30cm (in forested areas). We had DTM in form of shaded surface for one third of the Czech Republic. The shaded surface enables to highlight terrain break lines, which is suitable for archaeological research. Terrain modifications caused by human activity are characterized by terrain break lines, local tops or pits, which do not fit to local geomorphology. Visual image interpretation of the dataset is in the process.","ALS, Archaeology, DTM, Jáchymov, Medieval mines, Shaded relief",,,,,,,,"<Ancient maps - Modern data sets: Different investigative techniques in the landscape of the early iron age princely hill fort heuneburg, baden-wurttemberg, {eid: 58149297180}>, <Archaeological prospection of forested areas using full-waveform airborne laser scanning, {eid: 38949129807}>, <Exploitation of countrywide airborne LIDAR dataset for documentation of historical human activities in countryside, {eid: 84892577040}>, <Aerial laser scanning in archaeology, {eid: 84880441606}>, <Mapping and visualisation of a part of medieval road - Via magna, {eid: 84892562471}>, <None, {eid: 84907475231}>, <None, {eid: 84924318025}>, <None, {eid: 70349923731}>, <None, {eid: 71949125495}>, <Complex documentation of the bronze equestrian statue of jan zizka by using photogrammetry and laser scanning, {eid: 84946420074}>, <Experimental comparison of filter algorithms for bare-earth extraction from airborne laser scanning point clouds, {eid: 3342949547}>, <None, {eid: 84885385851}>",,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,,2013-09-02,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-84924250168

The seabed is produced in the FE model based on 3-D survey data (Digital Terrain Model, DTM) from the area where the pipeline is to be installed. In the in-place analysis part of the model, the load history of laying, flooding, pressure testing, and operation is simulated. In the on-bottom stability analysis part, wave and current loading is applied as a restart of the relevant loading condition and the dynamic behavior of the pipeline is investigated. The importance of simulating the true load history before applying the hydrodynamic loads is that it gives a more correct initial pipe configuration and force distribution prior to the stability analysis. A matter that complicates the on-bottom stability analysis of pipelines on a 3-D seabed is the fact that the hydrodynamic coefficients among other things are dependent on the seabed proximity. This problem has been solved in the FE model by calculating the gaps between the pipe and the seabed at multiple, equally spaced points along the pipe length, and calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients for drag, lift, and added mass as a function of this gap. The develop FE model may be applied to study the global static/dynamic on-bottom behavior of the pipeline, and to evaluate the effects of seabed intervention such as rock dumping and trenching. 3-D FE simulations are presented at the end of the paper as design examples.","Finite element model, In-place analysis, Offshore pipelines, On-bottom stability, Uneven seabed",,,,,,,,None,,,International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers,,,1999-05-30,,eng,Book,2-s2.0-0033237915

In previous work, an exogenous time distribution profile for trip departure rates is applied uniformly across all origin-destination (O-D) pairs. This article develops an endogenous departure time choice model based on an arrival time penalty function incorporated into trip distribution, which results in distinct demand profiles by O-D pair. This yields a simultaneous departure time and trip choice making use of the time-varying travel times in DTA. The required input is arrival time preferences, which can be disaggregated by O-D pair and may be easier to collect through surveys than the demand profile. This model is integrated into the four-step planning process with feedback, creating an extension of previous frameworks which aggregate over time. Empirical results from a network representing Austin, Texas indicate variation in departure time choice appropriate to the arrival time penalties and travel times. Our model also appears to converge faster to a dynamic trip table prediction than a time-aggregated coupling of DTA and planning, potentially reducing the substantial computation time of combined planning models that solve DTA as a subproblem of a feedback process.",,,,,,,,,"<Integration of environmental objectives in a system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model, {eid: 84863532160}>, <Origin-based algorithms for combined travel forecasting models, {eid: 0037409268}>, <A demand model with departure time choice for within-day dynamic traffic assignment, {eid: 33748921037}>, <Estimation of origin-destination matrix from traffic counts: the state of the art, {eid: 84855502514}>, <Activity-based modeling of travel demand, {eid: 0008647424}>, <Rewarding instead of charging road users: a model case study investigating effects on traffic conditions, {eid: 79960571718}>, <Introducing feedback into four-step travel forecasting procedure versus equilibrium solution of combined model, {eid: 0028529180}>, <Aspects of commuting behavior: preferred arrival time, use of information and switching propensity, {eid: 0027063778}>, <Dynamic traffic assignment: a primer, {eid: 84864252639}>, <A gap function vehicle-based solution procedure for consistent and robust simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment, {eid: 84953842737}>, <The cell transmission model: a dynamic representation of highway traffic consistent with the hydrodynamic theory, {eid: 0028481056}>, <The cell transmission model, part II: network traffic, {eid: 0028803659}>, <A path-based user-equilibrium traffic assignment algorithm that obviates path storage and enumeration, {eid: 33745865164}>, <Real-time OD estimation using automatic vehicle identification and traffic count data, {eid: 0036179677}>, <Investigating Regional Dynamic Traffic Assignment Modeling for Improved Bottleneck Analysis, {eid: 84938561945}>, <Dynamic network user equilibrium with state-dependent time lags, {eid: 0013229103}>, <Morning commute with competing modes and distributed demand: user equilibrium, system optimum, and pricing, {eid: 84867593161}>, <Multistate model for travel time reliability, {eid: 79551614151}>, <Complementarity formulations for the cell transmission model based dynamic user equilibrium with departure time choice, elastic demand and user heterogeneity, {eid: 80455174682}>, <Utilizing a static-based initial feasible solution to expedite the convergence of dynamic traffic assignment problems, {eid: 84929853159}>, <Warm-starting dynamic traffic assignment with static solutions, {eid: 84928012242}>, <Linear programming formulations for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment with arrival time based and departure time based demands, {eid: 0033317852}>, <Integration of activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment, {eid: 61349195054}>, <A Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition-based heuristic for off-line capacity calibration of dynamic traffic assignment, {eid: 78650402884}>, <Morning commute problem considering route choice, user heterogeneity and alternative system optima, {eid: 79952757239}>, <Reformulating the traffic equilibrium problem via a smooth gap function, {eid: 0034005060}>, <Integration of sustainability issues in strategic transportation planning: a multi-criteria model for the assessment of transport infrastructure plans, {eid: 77954885449}>, <Equivalent gap function-based reformulation and solution algorithm for the dynamic user equilibrium problem, {eid: 58249110601}>, <The four-step model, {eid: 3042799119}>, <The morning commute for nonidentical travelers, {eid: 0023348292}>, <Foundations of dynamic traffic assignment: the past, the present and the future, {eid: 0000230403}>, <Enhancing the practical usability of dynamic traffic assignment, {eid: 84953842738}>, <B-Dynamic: an efficient algorithm for dynamic user equilibrium assignment in activity-travel networks, {eid: 79952601999}>, <None, {eid: 0003582236}>, <A cell-based simultaneous route and departure time choice model with elastic demand, {eid: 2542430483}>, <None, {eid: 0003527784}>, <Integration of dynamic traffic assignment in a four-step model framework - a deployment case study in Seattle model, {eid: 84937159996}>, <Congestion theory and transport investment, {eid: 0000768007}>, <Improving Our Understanding of How Highway Congestion and Price Affect Travel Demand, {eid: 84941600729}>, <A simultaneous route and departure time choice equilibrium model on dynamic networks, {eid: 0007730201}>, <An internet-based geographic information system that integrates data, models and users for transportation applications, {eid: 0033795348}>",,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,,,2016-02-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-84953839089

Spectral reflectance provides a novel approach for soil allocation. This paper presents a nondestructive, rapid, and low-cost soil allocation method using topsoil spectral characteristics to allocate soil at the level of soil great group within Genetic Soil Classification of China. We measured the spectral reflectance in the visible and near-infrared regions (400–2500 nm) of 148 soil samples from 4 soil classes in the Songnen Plain of northeast China. We extracted the spectral characteristic parameters with clear physiochemical meanings for the topsoil samples, and compared these to the principle component, first spectral derivative and Continuum Removal of soil reflectance. Models were built using the K-means Clustering (K-mean), Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT) methods. The DTs allocation model based on topsoil spectral characteristic parameters had the highest allocation accuracy. Only the allocation accuracy of Cambisols was <85%, because the spectral curve of Cambisols topsoil was similar to its adjacent soil due to soil erosion. This new method could simplify digital soil mapping, because topsoil spectra are easier to obtain than multilayer soil spectral data.","Decision trees, K-means clustering, Neural network, Soil classification, Support vector machine, Topsoil spectral characteristics",,,,,,,,"<Predictive ability of soil properties to spectral degradation from laboratory vis-nir spectroscopy data, {eid: 84996555053}>, <Effects of soil compaction on the relationships between nematodes, grass production and soil physical properties, {eid: 0034212273}>, <Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy–principal components regression analyses of soil properties, {eid: 0035042039}>, <Potentiality of laboratory visible and near infrared spectroscopy for determining clay content in forest soils: a case study from high forest beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Calabria (Southern Italy), {eid: 84907256783}>, <Preliminary Study on Classification and Data Processing of Spectral Reflectance Characteristics of Main Soils in China//Remote Sensing Anthology, {eid: 85042937618}>, <Simultaneous determination of moisture, organic carbon, and total nitrogen by near infrared reflectance spectrophotometry, {eid: 0022928032}>, <Spectral pedology: a new perspective on evaluation of soils along pedogenetic alterations, {eid: 84891132113}>, <Evaluation of soil fertility using infrared spectroscopy: a review, {eid: 67349114152}>, <Neural networks learning improvement using the k-means clustering algorithm to detect network intrusions, {eid: 34250185435}>, <Spectral characteristics of salt-affected soils: a laboratory experiment, {eid: 45449116298}>, <Study on spectral features of soil Fe2O3, {eid: 43749098700}>, <Soil moisture and organic matter prediction of surface and subsurface soils using an nir soil sensor, {eid: 0034930460}>, <Subsoil compaction effects on crops in punjab, pakistan, {eid: 0034946868}>, <Score normalization in multimodal biometric systems ☆, {eid: 25144471298}>, <Rapid soil classification of paddy field in Guangdong province based on visible and near infrared reflectance spectra, {eid: 85017515431}>, <Soil taxonomy on the basis of reflectance spectral characteristics, {eid: 43049172027}>, <Retrieval of spruce leaf chlorophyll content from airborne image data using continuum removal and radiative transfer, {eid: 84872325934}>, <Topsoil, {eid: 85042927177}>, <Potential of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy to derive colour groups utilising the munsell soil colour charts, {eid: 34249982005}>, <Predicting in situ pasture quality in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, using continuum-removed absorption features, {eid: 0842306346}>, <What is a support vector machine?, {eid: 33845703344}>, <Eeg signals classification using the k -means clustering and a multilayer perceptron neural network model, {eid: 79957981604}>, <Soil conditions and plant growth, {eid: 0036176181}>, <Near- versus mid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for soil analysis emphasizing carbon and laboratory versus on-site analysis: where are we and what needs to be done?, {eid: 77953615617}>, <Predicting soil properties from the Australian soil visible–near infrared spectroscopic database, {eid: 84871589765}>, <Image spectroscopy and stable isotopes elucidate functional dissimilarity between native and nonnative plant species in the aquatic environment, {eid: 84855764430}>, <Cross-reference for relating genetic soil classification of china with WRB at different scales, {eid: 76449097585, doi: 10.1016/j.geoderma.2009.12.017}>, <Development of national VNIR soil-spectral library for soil classification and the predictions of organic matter.

Each stereopair can encompass an area up to 600 km x 120 km within a single pass (i.e. 72 000 km2stereoscopic strips). Covering now more than 120 millions sq.km of the Earth landmasses, SPOT 5 stereoscopic imagery has become one of main satellite data sources for accurate DEM extraction, at least where the cloud coverage leaves a chance to do so ! On the other hand, the TerraSAR-X satellite, launched in June 2007, is able to collect radar data through the clouds in several modes. An approach to extract height information by radargrammetry was developed, and the commercial distribution of Digital Elevation Models based on TerraSAR-X StripMap and SpotLight Modes (resp. 3m and 1m resolution) has started in 2010. To improve the overall height accuracy of the DEM, acquisitions from both orbit directions are utilised, each point on the ground being thus imaged at least 4 times by TerraSAR-X. Since 2002, Spot Image and French National Cartographic Institute (IGN) are building a worldwide database called Elevation30/Reference3D™, which includes a Digital Elevation Model at 1-arc-second resolution (DTED level 2) extracted from HRS stereopairs. To answer the wide demand of precise DEMs over Tropical and Northern areas, frequently covered by clouds, a study was performed to integrate StripMap radargrammetric TerraSAR-X data into the Reference3D process, and two prototype products were issued, over Colombia and Congo areas. During this experiment, efforts have been made to stick to technical steps that could be integrated within a standardized production process, in order to keep offering affordable prices while maintaining a high standard of horizontal and vertical accuracy. The DEMs extracted from TerraSAR-X and HRS proved extremely consistent with each other, showing a mean difference of 0.80m. This allows to propose a unified Elevation30 product to the users, with a guaranteed accuracy materialized into the product through a dedicated vertical Accuracy Commitment Mask.","Cost, DEM/DTM, Fusion, Precision, Quality, Radar, SPOT, Three-dimensional",,,,,,,,None,,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,,2012-08-25,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-84924292509

To estimate the risk factors of children experiencing delay in age-appropriate vaccination using a nationally representative population of children, and to compare risk factors for vaccination delay with those based on up-to-date vaccination status models. Methods. The authors compared predictors of delay in age-appropriate vaccination with those for children who were not up-to-date, using a nationally representative sample of children from five years of pooled data (1992-1996) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Immunization Supplement. Duration of delay was calculated for the DTP4, Polio3, MMR1 doses and 4:3:1 series using age-appropriate vaccination standards; up-to-date status (i.e., whether or not a dose was received) was also determined. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression for models of vaccination delay and up-to-date, vaccination status. Results. Absence of a two-parent household, large family size, parental education, Medicaid enrollment, absence of a usual provider, no insurance coverage, and households without a telephone were significantly related to increased odds of a child experiencing vaccination delay (p≤0.05). Conclusions. Many of the risk factors observed in models of vaccination delay were not found to be significant in risk models based upon up-to-date status. Consequently, risk models of delays in age-appropriate vaccination may foster identification of children at increased risk for inadequate vaccination. Populations at increased risk of inadequate vaccination can be more clearly identified through risk models of delays in age-appropriate vaccination.",,,,,,,,,"<Public health considerations - United States, {eid: 0002335098}>, <The need for surveillance of delay in age-appropriate immunization, {eid: 0036296742}>, <Timeliness of childhood immunizations, {eid: 0036842271}>, <National, state, and urban area vaccination coverage levels among children aged 19-35 months - United States, 2001, {eid: 0012399104}>, <None, {eid: 0003795820}>, <Summary of notifiable diseases - United States, 1999, {eid: 2042483758}>, <The effects of maternal health behaviors and other risk factors on immunization status among Mexican-American infants, {eid: 0029033630}>, <Personal, financial, and structural barriers to immunization in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children, {eid: 0031916407}>, <Risk factors for delayed immunization in a random sample of 1163 children from Washington and Oregon, {eid: 0027398153}>, <Risk factors for delayed immunization against measles, mumps, and rubella in Colorado two-year-olds, {eid: 0028145377}>, <Immunization status and birth order, {eid: 0029079208}>, <Influence of family functioning and income on vaccination in inner-city health centers, {eid: 0029836734}>, <Factors related to immunization status among inner-city Latino and African-American preschoolers, {eid: 0029080283}>, <Parental attitudes do not explain underimmunization, {eid: 0029859923}>, <Immunization status of children of employees of a large corporation, {eid: 84942950063}>, <Immunization coverage in a population-based sample of Maryland children, {eid: 0028281472}>, <Interaction of socioeconomic status and provider practices as predictors of immunization coverage in Virginia children, {eid: 0029051912}>, <Assessment of immunization compliance among children in the Department of Defense health care system, {eid: 0029915386}>, <Immunization performance measurement in a changing immunization environment, {eid: 0033060822}>, <The contribution of missed opportunities to childhood underimmunization in Baltimore, {eid: 0029870662}>, <None, {eid: 2442651131}>, <None, {eid: 85030889591}>, <Notice to readers: Recommended childhood immunization schedule - United States, January-June 1996, {eid: 0030569676}>, <None, {eid: 0003733868}>, <None, {eid: 0003414386}>, <Risk factors for delayed immunization among children in HMOs, {eid: 0028132125}>, <Markers for primary care: Missed opportunities to immunize and screen for lead and tuberculosis by private physicians serving large numbers of inner-city Medicaid-eligible children, {eid: 0029943428}>, <Vaccination coverage among children enrolled in Head Start programs or day care facilities or entering school, {eid: 0034703117}>, <Reviews of evidence regarding interventions to improve vaccination coverage in children, adolescents, and adults, {eid: 17544390532}>, <None, {eid: 2442657472}>, <None, {eid: 0348115877}>, <None, {eid: 0009576121}>, <Effect of patient reminder/recall interventions on immunization rates, {eid: 0034638515}>, <The impact of record scattering on the measurement of immunization coverage, {eid: 0035176115}>, <Vaccination coverage by race/ethnicity and poverty level among children aged 19-35 months-United States, 1997, {eid: 0032515202}>",,,Public Health Reports/ASPH,,,2004-01-01,15192901,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-2442642733

The DTD that we find has 4σ detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (τ < 0.42Gyr), intermediate (0.42 < τ < 2.4Gyr) and delayed (τ > 2.4Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD reconstructions. The best-fitting power-law form to the recovered DTD is t-1.07 ± 0.07, consistent with generic ∼t-1 predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs. The time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar mass is NSN/M = 0.00130 ± 0.00015M⊙-1, or about 4per cent of the stars formed with initial masses in the 3 - 8M⊙ range. This is lower than, but largely consistent with, several recent DTD estimates based on SN rates in galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher than, but consistent with NSN/M estimated by comparing volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.","Galaxies: star formation, Methods: data analysis, Supernovae: general",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 42649109365}>, <None, {eid: 84858986526}>, <None, {eid: 77956410057}>, <None, {eid: 0035917009}>, <None, {eid: 0742288803}>, <None, {eid: 2442542673}>, <None, {eid: 84555178997}>, <None, {eid: 78049245537}>, <None, {eid: 3142764853}>, <None, {eid: 84858954615}>, <None, {eid: 84860231948}>, <None, {eid: 0000582681}>, <None, {eid: 84860318063}>, <None, {eid: 84867856881}>, <None, {eid: 80052315935}>, <None, {eid: 48749093834}>, <None, {eid: 77950529560}>, <None, {eid: 84865292511}>, <None, {eid: 50849145221}>, <None, {eid: 24944488942}>, <None, {eid: 80053595539}>, <None, {eid: 77949510416}>, <None, {eid: 28144433114}>, <None, {eid: 0001289192}>, <None, {eid: 2942592572}>, <None, {eid: 84867890771}>, <None, {eid: 70350591937}>, <None, {eid: 69949164109}>, <None, {eid: 84856285260}>, <None, {eid: 79959213179}>, <None, {eid: 0001490806}>, <None, {eid: 83855164005}>, <None, {eid: 34248221145}>, <None, {eid: 84867844261}>, <None, {eid: 73349138572}>, <None, {eid: 80053616183}>, <None, {eid: 0000825185}>, <None, {eid: 84867890907}>, <None, {eid: 79953325921}>, <None, {eid: 79953295536}>, <None, {eid: 79953297933}>, <None, {eid: 83455220286}>, <None, {eid: 17144414827}>, <None, {eid: 33746083182}>, <None, {eid: 38749097490}>, <None, {eid: 38749137735}>, <None, {eid: 77956407659}>, <None, {eid: 84861308336}>, <None, {eid: 78149277675}>, <None, {eid: 77956418071}>, <None, {eid: 84861304315}>, <None, {eid: 25144474072}>, <None, {eid: 78751491328}>, <None, {eid: 77953637905}>, <None, {eid: 72849138369}>, <None, {eid: 0034800365}>, <None, {eid: 0000300312}>, <None, {eid: 0000335474}>, <None, {eid: 83455234789}>, <None, {eid: 73849090209}>, <None, {eid: 79952600021}>, <None, {eid: 34548142292}>, <None, {eid: 84863811771}>, <None, {eid: 0004161838}>, <None, {eid: 46249133923}>, <None, {eid: 84867875365}>, <None, {eid: 80053571103}>, <None, {eid: 42149113016}>, <None, {eid: 80052795663}>, <None, {eid: 0001383771}>, <None, {eid: 84856901979}>, <None, {eid: 84855820582}>, <None, {eid: 34249873010}>, <None, {eid: 84858060752}>, <None, {eid: 70549098983}>, <None, {eid: 80051614340}>, <None, {eid: 33748924222}>, <None, {eid: 80155195014}>, <None, {eid: 35448956583}>, <None, {eid: 72149129461}>, <None, {eid: 60049085332}>, <None, {eid: 85043601382}>, <None, {eid: 78649303571}>, <None, {eid: 84861781383}>, <None, {eid: 0000783536}>, <None, {eid: 0000508304}>, <None, {eid: 84873416005}>, <None, {eid: 0034388189}>",,,Oxford University Press,,,2012-11-11,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-84867881050

Based on observed limitations of the JSP (Java Server Page) technique commonly adopted for dynamic page generation (the view logic), we instead pro- pose an alternative solution approach, namely, a generic schema map- ping strategy to generate XML documents and DTDs from enterprise data beans. First, we describe in detail the XML generation process for the content composition logic. We also outline the XSL processing for the transformation logic. The separation of these two logics results in a generic solution to the bean viewing problem. In particular, it improves the bean reusability via its XML representative compared to the rigid strategy of hard-coding logics into JSP. Our proposed XML mapping solution represents a potentially valuable addition to future versions of the enterprise data beans specification. The trade-of between performance and exibility of these alternative solutions is discussed.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Today, cloud computation offloading may not be an appropriate solution for delay-sensitive applications due to the long distance between end-devices and remote datacenters. In addition, offloading to a remote cloud can consume bandwidth and dramatically increase costs. However, end-devices such as sensors, cameras, and smartphones have limited computing and storage capacity. Processing tasks on such battery-powered and energy-constrained devices becomes even more complex. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called Edge Computing (EC) emerged nearly a decade ago to bring computing resources closer to end-devices. Here, edge servers located between the end-device and the remote cloud perform user tasks. Recently, several new computing paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) have emerged to complement Cloud Computing (CC) and EC. Although these paradigms are heterogeneous, they can further reduce energy consumption and task response time, especially for delay-sensitive applications. Computation offloading is a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. A significant part of previous research in this field is devoted to Machine Learning (ML) methods. One of the essential types of ML is Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which an agent learns how to make the best decision using the experiences gained from the environment. This article provides a systematic review of the widely used RL approaches in computation offloading. It covers research in complementary paradigms such as mobile cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and the Internet of Things. We explain the reasons for using various RL methods in computation offloading from a technical point of view. This analysis includes both binary offloading and partial offloading techniques. For each method, the essential elements of RL and the characteristics of the environment are discussed regarding the most important criteria. Research challenges and Future trends are also mentioned.","Additional Key Words and PhrasesFog Computing, Mobile Cloud Computing, Mobile Edge Computing",,,,,,,,"<Joint computation offloading and task

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the backbones of Industry 4.0, where data quality is crucial for decision support. Data quality in these systems can deteriorate due to sensor failures or uncertain operating environments. Our objective is to summarize and assess the research efforts that address data quality in data-centric CPS/IoT industrial applications. We systematically review the state-of-the-art data quality techniques for CPS and IoT in Industry 4.0 through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. We pose three research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria for primary studies, and extract and synthesize data from these studies to answer our research questions. Our most significant results are (i) the list of data quality issues, their sources, and application domains, (ii) the best practices and metrics for managing data quality, (iii) the software engineering solutions employed to manage data quality, and (iv) the state of the data quality techniques (data repair, cleaning, and monitoring) in the application domains. The results of our SLR can help researchers obtain an overview of existing data quality issues, techniques, metrics, and best practices. We suggest research directions that require attention from the research community for follow-up work.","CPS, Data quality, Industry 4.0, IoT, systematic review",,,,,,,,"<IoT data qualification for a logistic chain traceability smart contract, {eid: 85103052866}>, <iSTEP, an integrated self-tuning engine for predictive maintenance in Industry 4. 0, {eid: 85063898878}>, <A layered quality framework for machine learning-driven data and information models, {eid: 85090790077}>, <Semantic stream management framework for data consistency in smart spaces, {eid: 85072673801}>, <Decision tree and random forest implementations for fast filtering of sensor data, {eid: 85021990607}>, <Using trust as a measure to derive data quality in data shared IoT deployments, {eid: 85093822267}>, <Blockchain framework for IoT data quality via edge computing, {eid: 85059288295}>, <Enabling predictive analytics for smart manufacturing through an IIoT platform, {eid: 85105555240}>, <How to address the data quality issues in regression models: A guided process for data cleaning, {eid: 85046079723}>, <Monitoring and control of unstructured manufacturing big data, {eid: 85099758302}>, <A trust architecture for blockchain in IoT, {eid: 85079872486}>, <Conceptual framework for manufacturing data preprocessing of diverse input sources, {eid: 85079034218}>, <IAI DevOps: A systematic framework for prognostic model lifecycle management, {eid: 85078067724}>, <An agricultural machinery operation monitoring system based on IoT, {eid: 85072793782}>, <BigClue analytics: A middleware component for modeling sensor data in IoT systems, {eid: 85062541061}>, <Resource-efficient sensor data management for autonomous systems using deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85073412912}>, <A healthcare monitoring system for the diagnosis of heart disease in the IoMT cloud environment using MSSO-ANFIS, {eid: 85088636373}>, <Data construction method for the applications of workshop digital twin system, {eid: 85080033682}>, <The process matters: Ensuring data veracity in cyberphysical systems, {eid: 84942546615}>, <Valid.

The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This article reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modeling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS and to prove relevant attributes such as system safety in the presence of intelligent behaviors and uncertainties.","Additional Key Words and PhrasesAutonomous cyber-physical production systems,

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Conceptual modeling is an important part of information systems development and use that involves identifying and representing relevant aspects of reality. Although the past decades have experienced continuous digitalization of services and products that impact business and society, conceptual modeling efforts are still required to support new technologies as they emerge. This paper surveys research on conceptual modeling over the past five decades and shows how its topics and trends continue to evolve to accommodate emerging technologies, while remaining grounded in basic constructs. We survey over 5,300 papers that address conceptual modeling topics from the 1970s to the present, which are collected from 35 multidisciplinary journals and conferences, and use them as the basis from which to analyze the progression of conceptual modeling. The important role that conceptual modeling should play in our evolving digital world is discussed, and future research directions proposed.","clustering analysis, Conceptual modeling, database, digital world, information systems, information technology, structured literature review",,,,,,,,"<Methods to integrate natural language processing into qualitative research, {eid: 85098322679}>, <None, {eid: 84915074052}>, <Cognitive fit in requirements modeling: A study of object and process methodologies, {eid: 0030307365}>, <Comparing conceptual modeling techniques: A critical review of the EER vs. OO empirical literature, {eid: 85015558939}>, <Analysis of scientific publications during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: Topic modeling study, {eid: 85096079830}>, <Generating research questions through problematization, {eid: 79952786467}>, <Grammatical specification of domain ontologies, {eid: 0346341054}>, <Exception handling in the context of fragment-based case management, {eid: 85168809786}>, <Dynamically switching execution context in data-centric BPM ap-proaches, {eid: 85123307983}>, <A test suite for JSON schema containment, {eid: 85168796746}>, <The relational model is dead, SQL is dead, and I dont feel so good myself, {eid: 84887435702}>, <Modeling resources and capabilities in enterprise architecture: A well-founded ontology-based proposal for ArchiMate, {eid: 84940722938}>, <The data structure set model, {eid: 84976809211}>, <The role concept in data models, {eid: 0017705709}>, <A general purpose programming system for random access memories, {eid: 84976716136}>, <A multi-level view model for secure object-oriented databases, {eid: 0031212983}>, <Computational problems related to the design of normal form relational schemas, {eid: 0018442877}>, <Models@run.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.","Artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain,

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Web 3.0 is the next generation of the Internet built on decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptography. It is born to solve the problems faced by the previous generation of the Internet such as imbalanced distribution of interests, monopoly of platform resources, and leakage of personal privacy. In this survey, we discuss the latest development status of Web 3.0 and the application of emerging AI technologies in it. First, we investigate the current successful practices of Web 3.0 and various components in the current Web 3.0 ecosystem and thus propose the hierarchical architecture of the Web 3.0 ecosystem from the perspective of application scenarios. The architecture we proposed contains four layers: data management, value circulation, ecological governance, and application scenarios. We dive into the current state of development and the main challenges and issues present in each layer. In this context, we find that AI technology will have great potential. We first briefly introduce the role that artificial intelligence technology may play in the development of Web 3.0. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current application status of artificial intelligence technology in the four layers of Web 3.0 and provide some insights into its potential future development directions.","artificial intelligence, blockchain, computing network, Web 3.0",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85197863514}>, <None, {eid: 85197896007}>, <Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, {eid: 84963893677}>, <A next-generation smart contract and decentralized application platform, {eid: 84945191046}>, <None, {eid: 85062500626}>, <None, {eid: 85197857794}>, <AttM-CNN: Attention and metric learning based CNN for pornography, age and Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Detection in images, {eid: 85103630264}>, <Anticipating cryptocurrency prices using machine learning, {eid: 85057092377}>, <Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision2021, {eid: 85147256635}>, <None, {eid: 85091702342}>, <Story scrambler-automatic text generation using word level RNN-LSTM, {eid: 85064558953}>, <An attention-based unsupervised adversarial model for movie review spam detection, {eid: 85100240412}>, <A survey on metaverse: Fundamentals, security, and privacy, {eid: 85137934422}>, <Fusing blockchain and AI with metaverse: A survey, {eid: 85136983020}>, <Artificial intelligence for the metaverse: A survey, {eid: 85142124906}>, <A brief survey of cryptocurrency systems, {eid: 85019185429}>, <Blockchain for decentralization of internet: prospects, trends, and challenges, {eid: 85106322987}>, <A survey on blockchain-based internet service architecture: Requirements, challenges, trends, and future, {eid: 85068314861}>, <A survey on blockchain-based identity management and decentralized privacy for personal data, {eid: 85095593342}>, <None, {eid: 85173640717}>, <HTML 4.01 Specification, {eid: 0003449827}>, <None, {eid: 0003415244}>, <Web 2.0: The origin of the word that has changed the way we understand public relations, {eid: 85173677413}>, <None, {eid: 85028827897}>, <None, {eid: 85169032535}>, <Decentralized ai: Edge intelligence and smart blockchain, metaverse, web3, and desci, {eid: 85135572135}>, <Collaboration-enabled intelligent internet architecture: Opportunities and challenges, {eid: 85144323440}>, <What is a support vector machine?, {eid: 33845703344}>, <Face recognition in the virtual world: recognizing avatar faces, {eid: 84873583050}>, <Naïve Bayes, {eid: 84893845803}>, <Optimal pricing in e-commerce based on sparse and noisy data, {eid: 85040331799}>, <An introduction to decision tree modeling, {eid: 9444289262}>, <Random forest, {eid: 85040555059}>, <Fine-grained webpage fingerprinting using only packet length information of encrypted traffic, {eid: 85098801307}>, <Convolutional neural network, {eid: 85040794277}>, <None, {eid: 84971369765}>, <Image style transfer using convolutional neural networks, {eid: 84986325538}>, <None, {eid: 85080505520}>, <Spectrogram-based classification of spoken foul language using deep CNN, {eid: 85099238776}>, <Design and implementation of fast spoken foul language recognition with different end-to-end deep neural network architectures, {eid: 85099712168}>, <Recurrent neural networks, {eid: 84903468625}>, <None, {eid: 85121818585}>, <Toward characterizing blockchain-based cryptocurrencies for highly accurate predictions, {eid: 85074830417}>, <A multi-modal approach to detect inappropriate cartoon video contents using deep learning networks, {eid: 85125587917}>, <Graph convolutional networks: A comprehensive review, {eid: 85074681354}>, <Identity inference on blockchain using graph neural network, {eid: 85153467624}>, <Phishing scams detection in ethereum transaction network, {eid: 85101685410}>, <Fine-grained webpage fingerprinting using only packet length information of encrypted traffic, {eid: 85098801307}>, <2022.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has stretched beyond manufacturing to include energy, healthcare, transportation, and all that tomorrow's smart cities will entail. The realm of IIoT includes smart sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems (DCS), embedded devices, supervisory control, and data acquisition systems - all produced by manufacturers for different purposes and with different data structures and formats; designed according to different standards and made to follow different protocols. In this sea of incompatibility, how can we flexibly acquire these heterogeneous data, and how can we uniformly structure them to suit thousands of different applications? In this article, we survey the four pillars of information science that enable collaborative data access in an IIoT - standardization, data acquisition, data fusion, and scalable architecture - to provide an up-to-date audit of current research in the field. Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures, reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to support heterogeneous requirements. The article also concludes with an overview of the frontier researches and emerging technologies for supporting or challenging data access from the aspects of 5G, machine learning, blockchain, and semantic web.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84883891709}>, <None, {eid: 85049185072}>, <None, {eid: 85102111580}>, <None, {eid: 85073318149}>, <None, {eid: 85174696333}>, <A survey on information and

A Survey on Trustworthy AI in Variable Autonomy Robotic Systems,2024,ACM Computing Surveys,2,10.1145/3645090,https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3645090,"<Umeå University>, <Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya>, <Queen Mary, University of London>",,"© 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).This article surveys the Variable Autonomy (VA) robotics literature that considers two contributory elements to Trustworthy AI: transparency and explainability. These elements should play a crucial role when designing and adopting robotic systems, especially in VA where poor or untimely adjustments of the system's level of autonomy can lead to errors, control conflicts, user frustration, and ultimate disuse of the system. Despite this need, transparency and explainability is, to the best of our knowledge, mostly overlooked in VA robotics literature or is not considered explicitly. In this article, we aim to present and examine the most recent contributions to the VA literature concerning transparency and explainability. In addition, we propose a way of thinking about VA by breaking these two concepts down based on: the mission of the human-robot team; who the stakeholder is; what needs to be made transparent or explained; why they need it; and how it can be achieved. Last, we provide insights and propose ways to move VA research forward. Our goal with this article is to raise awareness and inter-community discussions among the Trustworthy AI and the VA robotics communities.","explainability, human control, transparency, trustworthy AI, Variable autonomy",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85030228749}>, <None, {eid: 85052011774}>, <A model of symbiomemesis: Machine education and communication as pillars for human-autonomy symbiosis, {eid: 85113287338}>, <A topology of shared control systems-finding common ground in diversity, {eid: 85046351802}>, <Deliberate delays during robot-tohuman handovers improve compliance with gaze communication, {eid: 84897002742}>, <System transparency in shared autonomy: A mini review, {eid: 85057765063}>, <Seeing without knowing: Limitations of the transparency ideal and its application to algorithmic accountability, {eid: 85041740002}>, <Explainable agents and robots: Results from a systematic literature review, {eid: 85076471241}>, <Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, {eid: 85077515399}>, <Autonomy mode suggestions for improving human-robot interaction, {eid: 15744373625}>, <What is transparency?, {eid: 77950777880}>, <Measurement instruments for the anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence, and perceived safety of robots, {eid: 67650702793}>, <Toward a framework for levels of robot autonomy in human-robot interaction, {eid: 84907609633}>, <None, {eid: 0002439923}>, <How society can maintain human-centric artificial intelligence, {eid: 85063208972}>, <Towards trustworthiness and transparency in social human-robot interaction, {eid: 85093931780}>, <Collaborative autonomy: Human-robot interaction to the test of intelligent help, {eid: 85139859394}>, <Human-robot interaction through adjustable social autonomy, {eid: 85134191864}>, <Collaborative control for a robotic wheelchair: Evaluation of performance, attention, and workload, {eid: 84861200566}>, <Coactive design of explainable agent-based task planning and deep reinforcement learning for human-UAVs teamwork, {eid: 85092637358}>, <The IEEE global initiative for ethical considerations in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems standards, {eid: 85016585529}>, <Robots for humanity: Using assistive robotics to empower people with disabilities, {eid: 84874820952}>, <Mixed-initiative variable autonomy for remotely operated mobile robots, {eid: 85111177499}>, <Trust, shared understanding and locus of control in mixed-initiative robotic systems, {eid: 85115061300}>, <Experimental analysis of a variable autonomy framework for controlling a remotely operating mobile robot, {eid: 85006412315}>, <The effect of trialby-Trial adaptation on conflicts in haptic shared control for free-air teleoperation tasks, {eid: 84964555810, doi: 10.1109/TOH.2015.2477302}>, <From automationto autonomy: The importance of trust repair in human-machine interaction, {eid: 85045104296}>, <Explainability in human-robot teaming, {eid: 85116865588}>, <Vehicle automation-other road user communication and coordination: Theory and mechanisms, {eid: 85079763638}>, <The role of trust in automation reliance, {eid: 0037939746}>, <The effect of robotic wheelchair control paradigm and interface on user performance, effort and preference: An experimental assessment, {eid: 85020096268}>, <None, {eid: 85066513396}>, <Wheelchair navigation: Automatically adapting to evolving environments, {eid: 85073909110}>, <Defining socially assistive robotics, {eid: 33745789430}>, <Autonomy in surgical robots and its meaningful human control, {eid: 85059622337}>, <Task-based hybrid shared control for training through forceful interaction, {eid: 85086517439}>, <Theory of mind, {eid: 33645094008}>, <Anticipatory thinking: A testing and representation challenge for self-driving cars, {eid: 85105019134}>, <None, {eid: 85152580486}>, <Smart collaboration between humans and machines based on mutual understanding, {eid: 55549118183}>, <Probabilistic human intent recognition for shared autonomy in assistive robotics, {eid: 85088931279}>, <History and future of humanautomation interaction, {eid: 85065834773}>, <Mixed-initiative human-robot interaction: Definition, taxonomy, and survey, {eid: 84964507208}>, <The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines, {eid: 85089606091}>, <Coactive design: Designing support for interdependence in joint activity, {eid: 84909988466}>, <Interpretability beyond feature attribution: Quantitative testing with concept activation vectors, {eid: 85057264219}>, <Who should I blame?

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Wearable devices, or wearables, designed to be attached to the human body, can gather personalized real-time data and continuously monitor an individual's health status and physiological disposition in a non-invasive manner. Intelligent wearables integrate advanced machine learning algorithms to process complex data patterns and provide accurate insights. As a result, intelligent wearables have emerged as a ground-breaking innovation in the fields of sports and health, introducing a new paradigm in kinematic analysis and patient data evaluation. For example, virtual coaches offer feedback on athletes' performance, whereas virtual physicians assist in customizing medication for patients. This article provides an overview of various types of intelligent wearables and their applications in health and sports, categorizes machine learning algorithms, and introduces the wireless body area sensor network (WBASN) used for communication in wearable sensors.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Sensor-cloud originates from extensive recent applications of wireless sensor networks and cloud computing. To draw a roadmap of the current research activities of the sensor-cloud community, we first investigate the state-of-the-art sensor-cloud literature reviews published since the late 2010s and discovered that these surveys have primarily studied the sensor-cloud in specific aspects, security-enabled solutions, efficient management mechanisms, and architectural challenges. While the existing surveys have reviewed the sensor-cloud from various perspectives, they are inadequate for the three key issues that require urgent attention in the sensor-cloud: reliability, energy, and heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by examining the origins of the sensor-cloud and providing an in-depth and comprehensive discussion of these three key challenges. We summarize initial designs of the new edge-based schemes to address these challenges and identify several open issues and promising future research directions.","cloud computing, edge computing,

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.","artificial intelligence, Blockchain, lifecycle, software development, trustworthy

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not yet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the metaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.","blockchain, cross-metaverse interoperability, cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, economic system, incentive mechanism, Metaverse, non-fungible tokens",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85180147065}>, <None, {eid: 85180153801}>, <None, {eid: 85140412486}>, <An analysis of uniswap markets, {eid: 85091517723}>, <None, {eid: 85180148647}>, <None, {eid: 85180157781}>, <None, {eid: 85180155051}>, <AI-generated content: Authorship and inventorship in the age of artificial intelligence, {eid: 85076080410}>, <None, {eid: 85180155646}>, <None, {eid: 85180158784}>, <None, {eid: 85094017283}>, <None, {eid: 85180147884}>, <None, {eid: 85180149188}>, <When digital economy meets web 3.0: Applications and challenges, {eid: 85143572469}>, <Detecting ponzi schemes on ethereum: Towards healthier blockchain technology, {eid: 85049679107}>, <The economics of the metaverse: A comparison with the real economy, {eid: 85144766009}>, <None, {eid: 85113835525}>, <None, {eid: 85180148022}>, <None, {eid: 85129865347}>, <None, {eid: 60950317540}>, <None, {eid: 85180157002}>, <None, {eid: 85180158410}>, <None, {eid: 85180156058}>, <Flash boys 2.0: Frontrunning in decentralized exchanges, miner extractable value, and consensus instability, {eid: 85082955096}>, <IPFS and friends: A qualitative comparison of next generation peer-to-peer data networks, {eid: 85123346273}>, <None, {eid: 85138467220}>, <None, {eid: 85180147816}>, <None, {eid: 85180151381}>, <None, {eid: 85180150542}>, <None, {eid: 85180149994}>, <None, {eid: 85180157275}>, <None, {eid: 85180147613}>, <None, {eid: 85180150844}>, <None, {eid: 85144760350}>, <Attention-aware resource allocation and QoE analysis for metaverse xURLLC services, {eid: 85151338992}>, <Metaverse for social good: A university campus prototype, {eid: 85118984233}>, <Abstracts written by ChatGPT fool scientists, {eid: 85146484572}>, <None, {eid: 85111928058}>, <None, {eid: 85165528037}>, <None, {eid: 85180149194}>, <Hybrid blockchain-based resource trading system for federated learning in edge computing, {eid: 85100810891}>, <Fairness, incentives, and contractual choices, {eid: 0034095759}>, <ERNIE-ViLG 2.0: Improving text-to-image diffusion model with knowledge-enhanced mixture-of-denoising-experts, {eid: 85168293427}>, <None, {eid: 85180148883}>, <None, {eid: 85180150249}>, <None, {eid: 85180153620}>, <A survey of incentive mechanisms for participatory sensing, {eid: 84930503225}>, <None, {eid: 85144802374}>, <Being an avatar ""for real"": A survey on virtual embodiment in augmented reality, {eid: 85112618110}>, <Leveraging publicprivate blockchain interoperability for closed consortium interfacing, {eid: 85108137575}>, <Allocative efficiency of markets with zero-intelligence traders: Market as a partial substitute for individual rationality, {eid: 72949083817}>, <A dynamic resource allocation framework for synchronizing metaverse with iot service and data, {eid: 85137260812}>, <Proof of delivery of digital assets using blockchain and smart contracts, {eid: 85055213262}>, <A truthful online mechanism for collaborative computation offloading in mobile edge computing, {eid: 85083081075}>, <What do avatars want now?

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the extent to which ‘twins’ are applied today across the PSS life cycle, and to spotlight the ability of DT-related case studies to capture a full value perspective vs. simply attempting to represent hardware and services in the digital realm. By means of a systematic literature review combined with a mapping study, the paper reveals how only a minimal part of the existing literature is able to demonstrate how real-time physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-physical connections can be used to improve the design of servitized solutions. The analysis shows how contributions in the topic are mostly proposing frameworks and methods, as opposed to models and tools, as well as how ‘evaluation’, ‘validation’ tasks are largely neglected. As a result, the paper proposes a specialized definition of the PSS DT, together with a set of research questions that need to be answered to empower the engineering teams with relevant DT for PSS design.","Digital twin, Product-service systems, Systematic mapping, Systematic review",,,,,,,,"<Systematization of virtual product twin models in the context of smart product reconfiguration during

"Mauro F. (AUID: 57150512900), Kana A.A. (AUID: 24074490500)",Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review,2023,Ocean Engineering,44,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.113479,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.113479,"<Department of Maritime and Transportation Technology, Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering, Delft University of Technology>",,"© 2022 The Author(s)The focus on digitalisation in manufacturing is spreading to other industry fields, including large and complex objects like ships. Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.","Digital transition, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Literature review, Ship life-cycle",,,,,,,,"<Reconfiguration of smart product s during their use phase based on virtual product twins, {eid:

All rights reserved.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has been proposed as a potential tool in the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) in lieu of standard direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy. To comprehensively determine the diagnostic accuracy of immunoglobulin and complement IHC for diagnosis of AIBDs, we conducted a systematic review and multivariate Bayesian model-based meta-analysis of the literature. Quality and heterogeneity assessment of studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist and the I2index, respectively. Electronic searches using PubMed from April 1964 to July 2020 identified 14 articles meeting predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Median sensitivities with 95% credible intervals in pemphigus and pemphigoid were 0.24 (0.01-0.89) and 0.22 (0.02-0.77) with immunoglobulin G (IgG), 0.77 (0.39-0.95) and 0.25 (0.02-0.85) with IgG4, 0.11 (0.02-0.32) and 0.86 (0.56-0.98) with C3d, and 0.84 (0.56-0.97) and 0.75 (0.37-0.94) with C4d, respectively. Specificities were 1.00 (0.00-1.00) with IgG, 0.98 (0.89-1.00) with IgG4, 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with C3d, and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with C4d. The risk of bias and heterogeneity among studies was a serious problem, decreasing the level of evidence. Our work suggests that, in selected cases, paraffin-based IHC may be a helpful procedure to screen for AIBDs, especially when specialized laboratories and/or biopsy specimens for DIF do not exist. Nevertheless, more studies with a refined quality design are needed to explore the true usefulness of this diagnostic method in AIBDs.","immunohistochemistry, pemphigoid, pemphigus",,,,,,,,"<Diagnosis of autoimmune blistering diseases, {eid: 85060270822}>, <The use of paraffin-processed tissue and the immunoperoxidase technique in the diagnosis of bullous diseases, lupus erythematosus and vasculitis, {eid: 0020083174}>, <Diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase method, {eid: 0029047194}>, <The use of C3d and C4d immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed tissue as a diagnostic adjunct in the assessment of inflammatory skin disease, {eid: 53349141014}>, <C4d immunohistochemical stain is a sensitive method to confirm immunoreactant deposition in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in bullous pemphigoid, {eid: 65949097052}>, <C3d immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed tissue is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid of the skin, {eid: 77950821228}>, <Immunohistochemistry for immunoglobulin G4 on paraffin sections for the diagnosis of pemphigus, {eid: 84870893296}>, <The utility of C4d immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in the distinction of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy from pemphigoid gestationis, {eid: 84890857317}>, <Simultaneous immunolocalization of desmoglein 3 and IgG4 in oral pemphigus vulgaris: IgG4 predominant autoantibodies in its pathogenesis, {eid: 84946710711}>, <Application of C4d immunohistochemistry on routinely processed tissue sections for the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatoses, {eid: 84959101891}>, <Diagnostic value of immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsy specimens for bullous pemphigoid, {eid: 84997848443}>, <Can immunohistochemistry replace immunofluorescence in diagnosis of skin bullous diseases?, {eid: 85007595805}>, <Immunohistochemical diagnosis of mucous membrane pemphigoid, {eid: 85047721068}>, <C4d immunohistochemical stain of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as a sensitive method in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, {eid: 85066900991}>, <Comparison of C3d immunohistochemical staining to ELISA and immunofluorescence for diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, {eid: 85082682748}>, <QUADAS-2: a revised tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies, {eid: 80054740636}>, <Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations, {eid: 62849120031}>, <Bivariate analysis of sensitivity and specificity produces informative summary measures in diagnostic reviews, {eid: 24944498883}>, <Bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity with sparse data: a generalized linear mixed model approach, {eid: 33750696367}>, <Quantifying the impact of between-study heterogeneity in multivariate meta-analyses, {eid: 84870066370}>, <The role of complement in organ transplantation, {eid: 85073656983}>, <C4d and C3d immunohistochemical evaluation on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue for the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid: systematic review of the literatures, {eid: 85066909394}>",,,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,,2021-10-01,33055534,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85117426392

Currently, some DTs implementations are taking place. Nevertheless, the whole concept remains ambiguous and presents some differences that need to be addressed. The aim of this article is to bridge the gap between DTs definitions and current implementations. This review was conducted through a scientific literature review and an online survey. The study collects Digital Twins for cities definitions and compares them with related concepts used jointly in the literature. It puts them together through an in-depth analysis since they express similarities and various discrepancies. As our study highlights the most documented DTs initiatives for cities according to 9 comprehensive categories, a new approach assessing the initiatives is proposed to evaluate the data integration methods used in the current realizations. Three levels are suggested: a conceptual schema model-based level (the data are integrated into the top level of the DT, i.e., extending the schema model to cover new features or themes); a database-based level (data are integrated in order to feed or update specific attributes or classes); and an application-based level (the data are integrated into the application generally at the viewer level).","3D city model, City information model, Data integration, Digital twins, Spatial data infrastructure",,,,,,,,"<exploring digital twin adaptation to the urban environment: comparison with CIM to avoid silo-based approaches, {eid: 85132026799, doi: 10.5194/isprs-annals-V-4-2022-337-2022}>, <A Photorealistic 3D City Modeling Framework for Smart City Digital Twin, {eid: 85136104088}>, <Cyber-physical systems improving building energy management: digital twin and artificial intelligence, {eid: 85106177854, doi: 10.3390/en14082338}>, <USE cases for district-scale urban digital twins, {eid: 85140316961, doi: 10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W4-2022-5-2022}>, <None, {eid: 85166980389}>, <Digital twins in the construction industry: a perspective of practitioners and building authority, {eid: 85133498897, doi: 10.3389/fbuil.2022.834671}>, <Smart cities – systems of systems interoperability and OGC enablers, {eid: 85140331362, doi: 10.5194/isprs-annals-X-4-W3-2022-19-2022}>, <Hybrid aerial sensor data as basis for a geospatial digital twin, {eid: 85132139174, doi: 10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B4-2022-653-2022}>, <Digital twins, {eid: 85053693787, doi: 10.1177/2399808318796416}>, <Digital cornucopias: changing conceptions of the virtual city, {eid: 33846209952, doi: 10.1068/b3306ed}>, <Urban Digital Twins – A FIWARE-based model, {eid: 85120727456, doi: 10.1515/auto-2021-0083}>, <Applications of 3D city models: state of the art review, {eid: 84952802912, doi: 10.3390/ijgi4042842}>, <None, {eid: 85008902475}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049}>, <Digital twin technology challenges and applications: a comprehensive review, {eid: 85126301082, doi: 10.3390/rs14061335}>, <Digital twin for urban planning in the green deal era: a state of the art and future perspectives, {eid: 85131544176}>, <Urban scale digital twins in data-driven society: challenging digital universalism in urban planning decision-making, {eid: 85122656941, doi: 10.1177/14780771211070005}>, <Securing spatial data infrastructures for distributed smart city applications and services, {eid: 85069588985, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.07.002}>, <None, {eid: 85166906891}>, <A SEMANTICALLY ENRICHED AND WEB-BASED 3D ENERGY MODEL VISUALIZATION AND RETRIEVAL FOR SMART BUILDING IMPLEMENTATION USING CITYGML AND DYNAMIZER ADE, {eid: 85094136066}>, <None, {eid: 85166962599}>, <The development of 3D city model and its applications in urban planning, {eid: 80052344284}>, <A standard-based open source IoT platform: FIWARE, {eid: 85086591264, doi: 10.1109/IOTM.0001.1800022}>, <None, {eid: 85056157741}>, <Chapter 14 -

However, unsolved security challenges from their enlarged accessibility and connectivity have delayed realizing such systems. To address the emerging issues, the blockchain technology can be adopted to utilize its inherent generic security capabilities. However, research regarding the use of blockchain in manufacturing systems has only begun in the past few years while their research findings have been disseminated through a wide range of different outlets. This paper presents a literature review covering how manufacturing systems can adopt the blockchain technology while maintaining their production capacity, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. In addition to the survey, five categories of manufacturing systems striving to achieve the goal of Industry 4.0 are defined to provide a system model-based analysis. Also, a technology roadmap—that visualizes the chronological history of the technology—has been adopted to present the research trend and identify opportunities for future studies.","Additive

Similarity (or distance) models are core components of several retrieval concepts, e.g. Query by Example or relevance feedback. In these scenarios, the common approach is to apply some feature extractor that transforms the object to a vector of features, i.e., positions it into an induced latent space. The similarity is then based on some distance metric in this space. Historically, feature extractors were mostly based on some color histograms or hand-crafted descriptors such as SIFT, but nowadays state-of-the-art tools mostly rely on some deep learning (DL) approaches. However, so far there were no systematic study of how suitable are individual feature extractors in the video retrieval domain. Or, in other words, to what extent are human-perceived and model-based similarities concordant. To fill this gap, we conducted a user study with over 4000 similarity judgements comparing over 20 variants of feature extractors. Results corroborate the dominance of deep learning approaches, but surprisingly favor smaller and simpler DL models instead of larger ones.","Content-based video retrieval, Similarity models, User study",,,,,,,,"<V3C1 dataset: An evaluation of content characteristics, {eid: 85068079700}>, <Generative pretraining from pixels, {eid: 85134761720}>, <ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, {eid: 85198028989}>, <An image is worth 16 × 16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, {eid: 85101877225}>, <None, {eid: 84958199110}>, <Revealing the multidimensional mental representations of natural objects underlying human similarity judgements.

The salient features of MMC are modularity, reduced dv/dt and di/dt stress on switches, voltage and power scalability, inherent fault blocking capacity, transformerless operation, and improved power quality. However, there are some technical issues and challenges to be critically analysed and addressed. There is room for development of novel and enhanced MMC based on SM configurations to enable higher efficiency, improved power quality, compactness, and DC fault blocking capacity. Moreover, development of efficient and accurate models is required for the studies of MTDC grids during steady-state and transient conditions. Literature review suggests a need for studying and comparing different MMC modelling approaches because no modelling technique can be best suited for all applications. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of recent developments in MMC in terms of SM configurations. This paper also presents an in-depth review of systematic comparison of different models of MMC, which can enable appropriate selection of model based on target studies and desired accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the associated research challenges and future trends are presented.",,,,,,,,,"<Modular multilevel converters technology: a comprehensive study on its topologies, modelling, control and

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-12-14,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85099750826

However, the construction field currently needs a unified method to build a standardized and universally applicable digital twin model, which is incredibly challenging in construction. Therefore, this paper proposes a general method to construct a digital twin construction process model based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, aiming to realize real-time monitoring, control, and visualization management of the construction site. The method constructs a digital twin fusion model from three levels: geometric model, resource model, and behavioral model by establishing an IFC semantic model of the construction process, storing the fusion model data and the construction site data into a database, and completing the dynamic interaction of the twin data in the database. At the same time, the digital twin platform is developed to realize the visualization and control of the construction site. Combined with practical cases and analysis, the implementation effect of the method is shown and verified. The results show that the method can adapt itself to different scenarios on the construction site, which is conducive to promoting application of the digital twin in the field of construction and provides a reference to the research of practicing digital twin theory and practice.","building information model (BIM), construction process, database, digital twin, industry foundation classes

However, there is a lack of efficient and standardised approaches for managing monitoring-related information that can help to provide dynamic and reliable information for continuous dam evaluation. With the importance of digital twins (DTs) being proven in better data integration and interoperability, a DT-based approach for comprehensive dam evaluation and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) are provided in this study. This paper presents a new data structure and corresponding data classification strategy, using which information required for continuous evaluation can be effectively organised. Considering that existing evaluation methods cannot fully characterise uncertainties in the evaluation process, a cloud model based comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed. In this approach, a multi-rule cloud reasoning model is utilised to evaluate monitoring points. Also, a multi-dimensional cloud model and an improved Criteria Importance Though Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method are leveraged to assess evaluation indices affected by multiple factors. Finally, the results of a case study verify that the proposed DT-based solution realises a continuous dam safety evaluation, which contributes to automated and efficient dam condition monitoring.","building information modelling, cloud model, comprehensive dam evaluation, dam monitoring system, Digital twins, industry foundation classes, long-term monitoring",,,,,,,,"<Improved visualization of infrastructure monitoring data using building information modeling, {eid: 85064748508, doi: 10.1080/15732479.2019.1602150}>, <Failure analysis method of concrete arch dam based on elastic strain energy criterion, {eid: 84949228291, doi: 10.1016/j.engfailanal.2015.11.045}>, <None, {eid: 85117301962}>, <Constructing membership functions using statistical data, {eid: 0002539249, doi: 10.1016/0165-0114(86)90024-2}>, <Existing concrete dams: loads definition and finite element models validation, {eid: 85027303481, doi: 10.12989/smm.2016.3.2.129}>, <Improved online sequential extreme learning machine for identifying crack behavior in concrete dam, {eid: 85052325311, doi: 10.1177/1369433218788635}>, <Determining objective weights in multiple criteria problems: The critic method, {eid: 0009496304, doi: 10.1016/0305-0548(94)00059-H}>, <Towards sustainable facilities management, {eid: 84867289068}>, <Industry foundation classes for project management-A trial implementation, {eid: 0002257445}>, <Digital twin–Proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006}>, <Present situation and future prospect of hydropower in China, {eid: 64249094231, doi: 10.1016/j.rser.2008.08.013}>, <Research on online comprehensive regular evaluation model of dam safety based on guideline, {eid: 85117281181}>, <Bulletin 143: Historical review on ancient Dams, {eid: 85117294091}>, <Efficient dam management using SQL and GIS, {eid: 85117268939, doi: 10.37023/ee.7.2.1}>, <Development of dam safety management system, {eid: 64849105092, doi: 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2008.10.009}>, <A comprehensive evaluation method study for dam safety, {eid: 85032886530}>, <Application of Bayesian approach to dynamic probability evaluation of earth-rockfill dams security level, {eid: 52249097841}>, <Natural dam failure in slope failure mode triggered by seepage, {eid: 85083501765, doi: 10.1080/19475705.2020.1746697}>, <A fuzzy comprehensive assessment system of dam failure risk based on cloud model, {eid: 84875790340}>, <Digital twin aided vulnerability assessment and risk-based maintenance planning of bridge infrastructures exposed to extreme conditions, {eid: 85101241361, doi: 10.3390/su13042051}>, <A new cognitive model: Cloud model, {eid: 62149101392, doi: 10.1002/int.20340}>, <Automatic monitoring warning system of dams group, {eid: 27744473972}>, <Design and implementation of reservoir dam safety monitoring platform based on ASP.NET, {eid: 85034609739, doi: 10.1109/IAEAC.2017.8054504}>, <Xbim.

Thus, the aim of this research was to propose a holistic approach to manufacturing processes to assess their status and performance. Moreover, using the conceptual model, manufacturing systems can be modelled, considering all areas, flows, and factors in the respective areas of production, maintenance, and quality. As a result, the model serves as the basis for the integral management and control of manufacturing systems in digital twin models for the regulation of process stability and quality with maintenance strategies. Thus, a system dynamics simulation model based on the conceptual model is developed for a metallurgical process. The results show how the monitoring of all flows together with the optimal strategies in the quality and maintenance areas enable companies to increase their profitability and customer service level. In conclusion, the conceptual approach and the applied simulation case study allow better decision making, ensuring continuous optimization along the manufacturing asset lifecycle, and providing a unique selling proposition for equipment producers and service engineering suppliers as well as industrial companies.","Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Integrated manufacturing model, Maintenance management, Manufacturing process management and control, Metallurgical case study, Quality management, Simulation, System dynamics",,,,,,,,"<A categorical framework of manufacturing for industry 4.0 and beyond, {eid: 84992579469}>, <Virtual production-the connection of the modules through the virtual production intelligence, {eid: 84903483257}>, <Towards adaptable manufacturing systems, {eid: 84877621130}>, <Modeling and simulation of a flexible manufacturing system—a basic component of industry 4.0, {eid: 85096545123}>, <Big data implementation for the reaction management in manufacturing systems, {eid: 84960917802}>, <A model-based digital twin to support responsive manufacturing systems, {eid: 85107987654}>, <Industry 4.0–a glimpse, {eid: 85042481468}>, <El entorno de la industria 4.0: Implicaciones y perspectivas futuras, {eid: 85083855870}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <An integrated modeling method to support manufacturing systems analysis and design, {eid: 0033114836}>, <Model-based self-optimization for manufacturing systems, {eid: 80054909218}>, <Implementing smart factory of industrie 4.0: An outlook, {eid: 84958581089}>, <A general framework of a reference model for intelligent integrated manufacturing systems (REMIMS), {eid: 70449525561}>, <None, {eid: 85127099784}>, <Bottleneck-based synchronisation of engineering and manufacturing, {eid: 85125085880}>, <None, {eid: 0004313299}>, <Self-optimizing production systems, {eid: 84968919391}>, <A model for manufacturing systems simulation with a control dimension, {eid: 1642351720}>, <None, {eid: 84876832131}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,2021-12-20,,eng,Book Series,2-s2.0-85127192398

This paper uses the example of Roman African Red Slip Ware (ARS) and the collection of ARS at the LEIZA archaeological research institute. The main challenge is to create a Digital Twin of the ARS objects and artefacts using geometric capturing and semantic modelling of archaeological information. Moreover, the individualisation and comparison of features (appliqués), along with their visualisation, extraction, and rectification, results in a strategy and application for comparison of these features using both geometrical and archaeological aspects with a comprehensible rule set. This method of a semi-automatic semantic model-based comparison workflow for archaeological features on Roman ceramics is showcased, discussed, and concluded in three use cases: woman and boy, human–horse hybrid, and bears with local twists and shifts.","archaeology, ceramics, close-to-original 3D digital objects, image matching, interdisciplinary research, linked open data, rectification, semantic modelling, Wikidata",,,,,,,,"<Künstliche Intelligenz: Digitales Verstehen, {eid: 85156086983}>, <Archaeology 4.0: Archaeology in the Third Era of Computing, {eid: 85156114470, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.2629595}>, <Maschinelles Lernen angewendet auf Bilder antiker Münzen, {eid: 85156134350}>, <Kombination Maschineller Lernmethoden der Bild- und Texterkennung auf Antiken Münzdaten, {eid: 85156184477}>, <Clusterbildung Keltischer Münzen basierend auf Convolutional Neural Networks, {eid: 85156168422}>, <Lovelace & babbage and the creation of the 1843 notes, {eid: 0348011361, doi: 10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}>, <How to make Zuse’s Z3 a universal computer, {eid: 0032121281, doi: 10.1109/85.707574}>, <None, {eid: 0038990246}>, <None, {eid: 70450163544}>, <None, {eid: 85156121432}>, <None, {eid: 85156162692}>, <Typologie-Handling zur Dokumentation mit Hilfe künstlicher Intelligenz, {eid: 85156161625, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7179955}>, <Digging in documents: Using text mining to access the hidden knowledge in Dutch archaeological excavation reports, {eid: 85156165600}>, <Can BERT Dig It?

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license.The manufacturing sector is experiencing a technological paradigm shift, where new information technology (IT) concepts can help digitize product design, production systems, and manufacturing processes. One of such concepts is Digital Twin and researchers have made some advancement on both its conceptual development and technological implementations. However, in practice, there are many different definitions of the digital-twin concept. These different definitions have created a lot of confusion for practitioners, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, the adoption and implementation of the digital-twin concept in manufacturing have been difficult and slow. In this paper, we report our findings from a survey of companies (both large and small) regarding their understanding and acceptance of the digital-twin concept. Five supply-chain companies from discrete manufacturing and one trade organization representing suppliers in the automotive business were interviewed. Their operations have been studied to understand their current digital maturity levels and articulate their needs for digital solutions to stay competitive. This paper presents the results of the research including the viewpoints of these companies in terms of opportunities and challenges for implementing digital twins.","Digital twin, Digitalization, Smart manufacturing, Supply chain",,,,,,,,"<Digital Manufacturing: Requirements and Challenges for Implementing Digital Surrogates, {eid: 85062624777, doi: 10.1109/WSC.2018.8632242}>, <None, {eid: 85101247166}>, <What are Digital Twins and Why Will They Be Integral to the Internet of Things?, {eid: 85101240181}>, <Digital Twin for Smart Manufacturing: The Simulation Aspect, {eid: 85081115806, doi: 10.1109/WSC40007.2019.9004659}>, <Gartner Survey Reveals Digital Twins Are Entering Mainstream Use, {eid: 85074450188}>, <None, {eid: 84983461822}>, <None, {eid: 85101257806}>, <None, {eid: 85092345471}>, <Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems, {eid: 85006339863, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4}>, <Framework for a Digital Twin in Manufacturing: Scope and Requirements, {eid: 85083292687, doi: 10.1016/j.mfglet.2020.04.004}>, <An AI-based Methodology for Factory Design, {eid: 0042209856, doi: 10.1609/aimag.v7i4.560}>, <Industry Review of Distributed Production in Discrete Manufacturing, {eid: 85103296551, doi: 10.1115/1.4046988}>, <None, {eid: 85101291780}>, <None, {eid: 85101208651}>, <White paper: How create a digital twin, {eid: 85101258070}>",,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),,,2020-11-16,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85101251545

One of essential pillars for digital transformation in mining is Building Information Model (BIM), which is also one of the first steps to implement Digital Twin. Additionally, using BIM integrated with Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and adopting digital technology can provide powerful assistance in life cycle of mining. In this study, integrating BIM and TLS point clouds, which is the basic framework of DM, was applied to build 3D mining information model as well as assessing safety of Nui Beo underground coal mining in Vietnam. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard is used to define the mining information model based on TLS point clouds providing geometric and attributive information of the structures. The 3D model was built for important structures of the mine, including the mine shaft, and tunnels based on TLS point cloud. Additionally, the safety assessment of rail tracks in the mine shaft was performed by comparing the TLS point cloud of rail tracks and their as-designed BIM models. The results showed that the integration of BIM and TLS is a practical solution for the information management and safety assessment of underground coal mines.","BIM, IFC, Nui beo coal mine, TLS, Underground coal mine",,,,,,,,"<Procedural point cloud modelling in scan-to-BIM and scan-vs-BIM applications: A review, {eid: 85166289441, doi: 10.3390/ijgi12070260}>, <None, {eid: 85203990566}>, <Quality assessment of 3D point cloud of industrial buildings from imagery acquired by oblique and nadir UAV flights, {eid: 85118302698}>, <Research on digital mine modeling based on BIM technology, {eid: 85139935852}>, <From BIM to digital twins: A systematic review of the evolution of intelligent building representations in the AEC-FM industry, {eid: 85103484819, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2021.005}>, <3D GIS for mine development - integrated concepts, {eid: 84921022765, doi: 10.1080/17480930.2013.828443}>, <The advent of digital twins in surface mining: Its time has finally arrived, {eid: 85143319706, doi: 10.1016/j.resourpol.2022.103155}>, <UAV for mapping historic buildings: From 3D modelling to BIM, {eid: 85065442399}>, <A tunnel information modelling framework to support management, simulations and visualisations in mechanised tunnelling projects, {eid: 85028543502, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2017.07.006}>, <Information modeling of mine working based on BIM technology, {eid: 85108060631, doi: 10.1016/j.tust.2021.103978}>, <A BIM-data mining integrated digital twin framework for advanced project management, {eid: 85100105417, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103564}>, <Automated reconstruction of parametric BIM for bridge based on terrestrial laser scanning data, {eid: 85100219171}>, <None, {eid: 85204016978, doi: 10.2139/ssrn.4774748}>, <BIM semantic-enrichment for built heritage representation, {eid: 85056253008, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.004}>, <Field studies of electronic total stations in a special reference satellite geodetic basis, {eid: 85147257838}>, <Automatic geometry generation from point clouds for BIM, {eid: 84942543696, doi: 10.3390/rs70911753}>, <None, {eid: 85091003224}>, <Measurement of railroad track irregularities using an automated recording vehicle, {eid: 85109096995, doi: 10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109765}>, <BIM and GIS applications in bridge projects: A critical review, {eid: 85110277221, doi: 10.3390/app11136207}>, <Application and risk analysis of BIM in railway systems, {eid: 84899702192}>, <Fast and robust iterative closest point, {eid: 85100488518}>, <An easy-to-use airborne LiDAR data filtering method based on cloth simulation, {eid: 84974785092, doi: 10.3390/rs8060501}>, <Research on management and application of tunnel engineering based on BIM technology, {eid: 85078629287}>, <Developing a tailored RBS linking to BIM for risk management of bridge projects, {eid: 84996593462, doi: 10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0009}>",,,Korean Society of Civil Engineers,,,2024-01-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85203999069

Remote sensing and deep learning are feasible methods for creating large-scale farmland boundary maps. However, existing neural network models have limitations that restrict the accuracy and reliability of agricultural parcel extraction using remote sensing technology. In this study, we used high-resolution satellite images (2 m, 1 m, and 0.8 m) and the U2-Net++ model based on the RSU module, deep separable convolution, and the channel-spatial attention mechanism module to extract different types of fields. Our model exhibited significant improvements in farmland parcel extraction compared with the other models. It achieved an F1-score of 97.13%, which is a 7.36% to 17.63% improvement over older models such as U-Net and FCN and a more than 2% improvement over advanced models such as DeepLabv3+ and U2-Net. These results indicate that U2-Net++ holds the potential for widespread application in the production of large-scale farmland boundary maps.","channel-spatial attention mechanism, deep learning,

Objectives: To present a systematic quantitative review summarising the evidence related to management protocols for PUL. Search strategy: MEDLINE, COCHRANE and DARE databases were searched from 1 January 1984 to 31 January 2017. The primary outcome was accurate risk prediction of women initially diagnosed with a PUL having an ectopic pregnancy (high risk) as opposed to either a failed PUL or intrauterine pregnancy (low risk). Selection criteria: All studies written in the English language, which were not case reports or series that assessed women classified as having a PUL at initial ultrasound. Data collection and analysis: Forty-three studies were included. QUADAS-2 criteria were used to assess the risk of bias. We used a novel, linear mixed-effects model and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves for the thresholds of interest. Main results: There was a high risk of differential verification bias in most studies. Meta-analyses of accuracy were performed on (i) single human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) cut-off levels, (ii) hCG ratio (hCG at 48 hours/initial hCG), (iii) single progesterone cut-off levels and (iv) the ‘M4 model’ (a logistic regression model based on the initial hCG and hCG ratio). For predicting an ectopic pregnancy, the areas under the curves (95% CI) for these four management protocols were as follows: (i) 0.42 (0.00–0.99), (ii) 0.69 (0.57–0.78), (iii) 0.69 (0.54–0.81) and (iv) 0.87 (0.83–0.91), respectively. Conclusions: The M4 model was the best available method for predicting a final outcome of ectopic pregnancy. Developing and validating risk prediction models may optimise the management of PUL.

A narrow panel of methods and tools are available on the market; they offer different scopes and approaches, are more or less intuitive to follow, and are sometimes supported by tools. Among them, the Architecture Analysis & Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) is becoming popular and is gradually spreading in different industrial fields to model a wide variety of systems at different stages of their development and from different points of view. It is implemented using an open-source tool called Capella. Few feedback on its use in industrial settings have been published, while other feedback remains confidential. The goal of this paper is to analyze the interests and limitations of ARCADIA/Capella. To reach this goal, we experimented with ARCADIA/Capella in several projects and chose one to explain how the method and tool proceeded. In addition, we conducted a survey to obtain industrial feedback. As a result, the paper gives an overview of the relevance of ARCADIA/Capella in projects and of its usefulness, effectiveness, and adaptability in modeling different types of systems.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Sea level rise is an important and topical issue in the South Pacific region and needs an urgent assessment of trends for informed decision making. This paper presents mean sea level trend assessment using harmonic analysis and a hybrid deep learning (DL) model based on the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) technique, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) to build a highly accurate sea level forecasting model for three small islands (Fiji, Marshall Island and Papua New Guinea (PNG)) in the South Pacific. For a 20-year period, the estimated mean sea level rise per year from the harmonic computation is obtained: 112 mm for PNG, 98 mm for Marshall Island and 52 mm for Fiji. The DL procedure uses climate and environment-based remote sensing satellite (MODIS, GLDAS-2.0, MODIS TERRA, MERRA-2) predictor variables with tide gauge base mean sea level (MSL) data for model training and development for forecasting. The developed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU as the objective model is benchmarked by comparison to the hybrid model without data decomposition, CNN-GRU and standalone models, Decision Trees (DT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). All model performances are evaluated using reliable statistical metrics. The CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU shows superior accuracy when compared with other standalone and hybrid models. It shows an accuracy of >96% for correlation coefficient and an error of <1% for all study sites.","Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep learning (DL), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Mean sea level (MSL), Neigh-bourhood Component Analysis (NCA)",,,,,,,,"<Climate change impacts on tropical cyclones and extreme sea levels in the South Pacific—A regional assessment, {eid: 81255165013}>, <None, {eid: 84904834913}>, <Data-driven modeling of global storm surges, {eid: 85084373038}>, <Comparing impact effects of common storms and Medicanes along the coast of south-eastern Sicily, {eid: 85109439397}>, <Understanding and managing human threats to the coastal marine environment, {eid: 66149087775}>, <Vulnerability of South Pacific island nations to sea-level rise, {eid: 0004752960}>, <Multiproxy assessment of Holocene relative sea-level changes in the western Mediterranean: Sea-level variability and improvements in the definition of the isostatic signal, {eid: 84960942489}>, <Sea-level change along the Italian coast for the past 10,000 yr, {eid: 2642565465}>, <Present-day sea level change: Observations and causes, {eid: 10344261969}>, <An EEMD-BiLSTM Algorithm Integrated with Boruta Random Forest Optimiser for Significant Wave Height Forecasting along Coastal Areas of Queensland, Australia, {eid: 85104204184}>, <Application of the multi-adaptive regression splines to integrate sea level data from altimetry and tide gauges for monitoring extreme sea level events, {eid: 84942121316}>, <Daily sea level prediction at Chiayi coast, Taiwan using extreme learning machine and relevance vector machine, {eid: 85039702290}>, <LSTM integrated with Boruta-random forest optimiser for soil moisture estimation under RCP4. 5 and RCP8. 5 global warming scenarios, {eid: 85100802965}>, <Deep learning hybrid model with Boruta-Random forest optimiser algorithm for streamflow forecasting with climate mode indices, rainfall, and periodicity, {eid: 85106223075}>, <Hybrid Deep Learning for Week-Ahead Evapotran-spiration Forecasting, {eid: 85124956170}>, <Global solar radiation prediction by ANN integrated with European Centre for medium range weather forecast fields in solar rich cities of Queensland Australia, {eid: 85060937506}>, <Deep Air Quality Forecasts: Suspended Particulate Matter Modeling With Convolutional Neural and Long Short-Term Memory Networks, {eid: 85097652945}>, <Designing deep-based learning flood forecast model with ConvLSTM hybrid algorithm, {eid: 85103177771}>, <The tide gauge, tidal harmonic analyser, and tide predicter, {eid: 83755230751}>, <Relative sea levels from tide-gauge records, {eid: 0007592465}>, <Investigating the role of atmospheric variables on sea level variations in the Eastern Central Red Sea using an artificial neural network approach, {eid: 85081643683}>, <Unabated global mean sea-level rise over the satellite altimeter era, {eid: 84929740040}>, <Uncertainty in satellite estimates of global mean sea-level changes, trend and acceleration, {eid: 85070442964}>, <None, {eid: 84872909047}>, <Effect of global warming on sea level rise: A modeling study, {eid: 85032710812}>, <The multimillennial sea-level commitment of global warming, {eid: 84882750887}>, <A semi-empirical approach to projecting future sea-level rise, {eid: 33846648686}>, <Sea level rise: History and consequences, {eid: 0004084090}>, <Sea-level acceleration based on US tide gauges and extensions of previous global-gauge analyses, {eid: 79955986612}>, <Discussion of: Houston, J.R.; Dean, R.G.

The Author(s). Published by the American Astronomical Society.The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) observes the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the angular scales of 1° 2 θ ≤ 90° with the aim of characterizing primordial gravitational waves and cosmic reionization. We report on the on-sky performance of the CLASS Q-band (40 GHz), W-band (90 GHz), and dichroic G-band (150/220 GHz) receivers that have been operational at the CLASS site in the Atacama desert since 2016 June, 2018 May, and 2019 September, respectively. We show that the noise-equivalent power measured by the detectors matches the expected noise model based on on-sky optical loading and lab-measured detector parameters. Using Moon, Venus, and Jupiter observations, we obtain power to antenna temperature calibrations and optical efficiencies for the telescopes. From the CMB survey data, we compute instantaneous array noise-equivalent-temperature sensitivities of 22, 19, 23, and 71 μKcmbs for the 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz frequency bands, respectively.

Some invoke anthropogenic forcing through mechanisms related to climate change3-5, nitrogen deposition 6 or changes in land use7, and by implication suggest that current concentrations and fluxes are without precedent. All of these hypotheses imply that DOC levels will continue to rise, with unpredictable consequences for the global carbon cycle. Alternatively, it has been proposed that DOC concentrations are returning toward pre-industrial levels as a result of a gradual decline in the sulphate content of atmospheric deposition 8-10. Here we show, through the assessment of time series data from 522 remote lakes and streams in North America and northern Europe, that rising trends in DOC between 1990 and 2004 can be concisely explained by a simple model based solely on changes in deposition chemistry and catchment acid-sensitivity. We demonstrate that DOC concentrations have increased in proportion to the rates at which atmospherically deposited anthropogenic sulphur and sea salt have declined. We conclude that acid deposition to these ecosystems has been partially buffered by changes in organic acidity and that the rise in DOC is integral to recovery from acidification. Over recent decades, deposition-driven increases in organic matter solubility may have increased the export of DOC to the oceans, a potentially important component of regional carbon balances 11. The increase in DOC concentrations in these regions appears unrelated to other climatic factors. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,,,,,,,,"<Browning the waters, {eid: 33751105494}>, <Regional scale evidence for improvements in surface water chemistry 1990-2001, {eid: 20444381327}>, <Long term records of riverine dissolved organic matter, {eid: 0041942739}>, <Export of organic carbon from peat soils, {eid: 0035939950}>, <Export of dissolved organic carbon from peatlands under elevated carbon dioxide levels, {eid: 3142543230}>, <Increased carbon transport in the Hudson River: Unexpected consequence of nitrogen deposition?, {eid: 16844374971}>, <Effects of burning and grazing on carbon sequestration in a Pennine blanket bog, {eid: 0033670032}>, <Alternative explanations for rising dissolved organic carbon export from organic soils, {eid: 33749818762}>, <None, {eid: 0037581763}>, <Increasing trends of total organic carbon concentrations in small forest lakes in Finland from 1987 to 2003, {eid: 33745121484}>, <The European carbon budget: A gap, {eid: 0345600226}>, <Chemical trends at lakes and streams in the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network, 1988-2000: Evidence for recent recovery at a national scale, {eid: 0035198368}>, <Sources of stream sulfate at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, {eid: 0033024259}>, <Terrestrial export of organic carbon, {eid: 0037148757}>, <The apparent and potential effects of climate change on the inferred concentration of dissolved organic matter in a temperate stream (the Malse River, South Bohemia), {eid: 0037939711}>, <Long-term increases in surface water dissolved organic carbon: Observations, possible causes and environmental impacts, {eid: 20444397061}>, <Analysis of streamflow trends and the effects of climate in Pennsylvania, 1971 to 2001, {eid: 31344444930}>, <Winter climate affects long-term trends in stream water nitrate in acid-sensitive catchments in southern Norway, {eid: 40949151867}>, <Recent variations in climate and hydrology in Canada, {eid: 0034156952}>, <Trends and characteristics of hydrological time series in Finland, {eid: 0037255518}>, <Trends in nitrogen deposition and leaching in acid-sensitive streams in Europe, {eid: 0035193816}>, <Acid rain on acid soil: A new perspective, {eid: 0021043489}>, <Suppression of dissolved organic carbon by sulphate induced acidification during simulated droughts, {eid: 33645221277}>, <Predicting aluminum and soil organic matter solubility using the mechanistic equilibrium model WHAM, {eid: 0242270421}>, <The impact of acid treatment on soilwater chemistry at the HUMEX site, {eid: 0028160701}>, <None, {eid: 0024264346}>, <The distribution of humic substances between the solid and aqueous phases of acid organic soils; a description based on humic heterogeneity and charge-dependent sorption equilibria, {eid: 0026281902}>, <Solution parameters influencing dissolved organic carbon levels in three forest soils, {eid: 0024107161}>, <None, {eid: 0004249246}>, <On a class of aligned rank order tests in two-way layouts, {eid: 0001626669}>",,,Nature Publishing Group,,,2007-11-21,18033294,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-36549064699

Most of this research has focused on representing the response uncertainty as intervals, e.g., 'I give the movie between 2 and 4 stars.' In this paper, we extend upon the model-based interval agreement approach (IAA) for combining interval data into fuzzy sets and propose the efficient IAA (eIAA) algorithm, which enables efficient representation of and operation on the fuzzy sets produced by IAA (and other interval-based approaches, for that matter). We develop methods for efficiently modeling, representing, and aggregating both crisp and uncertain interval data (where the interval endpoints are intervals themselves). These intervals are assumed to be collected from individual or multiple survey respondents over single or repeated surveys; although, without loss of generality, the approaches put forth in this paper could be used for any interval-based data where representation and analysis is desired. The proposed method is designed to minimize loss of information when transferring the interval-based data into fuzzy set models and then when projecting onto a compressed set of basis functions.

The relatively low molecular gas mass, Mgas = (2.3 ± 0.5) × 109 M·, and far-infrared (FIR) luminosity, LFIR = (7.2 ± 1.5) × 1011 L·, of this quasar could be explained by its relatively low dynamical mass, Mdyn = (3.9 ± 0.9) × 109 M·.

This review aims to provide a quantitative review to analyze specific study contents, research focus, and trends of DT in healthcare. Simultaneously, this review intends to expand the connotation of “healthcare” into two directions, namely “Disease treatment” and “Health enhancement” to analyze the content within the “DT + healthcare” field thoroughly. Methods: A data mining method named Structure Topic Modeling (STM) was used as the analytical tool due to its topic analysis ability and versatility. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure supplied the material papers in this review. Results: A total of 94 high-quality papers published between 2018 and 2022 were gathered and categorized into eight topics, collectively covering the transformative impact across a broader spectrum in healthcare. Three main findings have emerged: (1) papers published in healthcare predominantly concentrate on technology development (artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc.) and application scenarios(personalized, precise, and real-time health service); (2) the popularity of research topics is influenced by various factors, including policies, COVID-19, and emerging technologies; and (3) the preference for topics is diverse, with a general inclination toward the attribute of “Health enhancement.” Conclusions: This review underscores the significance of real-time capability and accuracy in shaping the future of DT, where algorithms and data transmission methods assume central importance in achieving these goals. Moreover, technological advancements, such as omics and Metaverse, have opened up new possibilities for DT in healthcare. These findings contribute to the existing literature by offering quantitative insights and valuable guidance to keep researchers ahead of the curve.","artificial intelligence, digital twin, Healthcare, structure topic modeling, text data mining",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4.0 in healthcare: A systematic review, {eid: 85129949636}>, <Healthcare 4.0: trends, challenges and research directions, {eid: 85076883318}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 85174225297}>, <None, {eid: 85174267280}>, <None, {eid: 85174285417}>, <None, {eid: 85046337978}>, <Knowledge-based systems digital twin-assisted Blockchain-inspired irregular event analysis for eldercare, {eid: 85143547493}>, <Digital twins in healthcare: an architectural proposal and its application in a social distancing case study, {eid: 85137900898}>, <None, {eid: 85145508570}>, <Biomedical technology exploring the revolution in healthcare systems through the applications of digital twin technology, {eid: 85169073557}>, <The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews, {eid: 85103451714}>, <Suitability of google scholar as a source of scientific information and as a source of data for scientific evaluation—review of the literature, {eid: 85021624027}>, <The role of google scholar in evidence reviews and its applicability to grey literature searching.

However, the modeling, representation, update, and exchange of geological information are challenging because they are managed by heterogeneous data models supported by two-dimensional (2D) representation that lacks volumetric information, 3D visualization, and integration. This study presents a novel geological data model using BIM and GIS to facilitate three-dimensional (3D) modeling and management of geological information. The proposed geological data model contains significant geometric, semantic, and spatial information, for which the IFC and CityGML ADE is extended. The BIM and GIS data has been mapped using IFC and CityGML. Moreover, the proposed geological data model uses a boundary and voxel geometric representation for the geological data. Algorithms are developed to create an efficient 3D geological boundary and voxel model based on the developed geological data model. Furthermore, the voxel size, number, and attributes can be updated efficiently, enabling the representation of geological information at different scales. Subsequently, the proposed BIM-GIS framework is demonstrated in a case study using geotechnical investigation data from a city. A questionnaire survey was conducted to verify the practical implications of the proposed method. Consequently, it was found that the proposed method improves geological data management efficiency and the geological information exchange process, which further facilitates the analysis by providing effective 3D visualization, inhomogeneous geological information, and enhancing integration.","3D geological data model, Data level BIM and GIS, Geological data management, Geological Digital twin,

As a result, reliable Flood Susceptibility Mapping (FSM) is required for effective flood management and reducing its harmful effects. In this study, a new machine learning model based on the Cascade Forest Model (CFM) was developed for FSM. Satellite imagery, historical reports, and field data were used to determine flood-inundated areas. The database included 21 flood-conditioning factors obtained from different sources. The performance of the proposed CFM was evaluated over two study areas, and the results were compared with those of other six machine learning methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The result showed CFM produced the highest accuracy compared to other models over both study areas. The Overall Accuracy (AC), Kappa Coefficient (KC), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of the proposed model were more than 95%, 0.8, 0.95, respectively. Most of these models recognized the southwestern part of the Karun basin, northern and northwestern regions of the Gorganrud basin as susceptible areas.","Cascade Forest Model, flood susceptibility

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The aim of this study was to examine usual daily micronutrient intake of Chinese children based on data from the 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey. We analyzed data from 4 to 17-year-old participants, who provided dietary data on three consecutive days combined with the household weighing method in 2011. Usual daily intake of each nutrient was estimated using a mixed effects model based on the China Food Composition published in 2009. The means, medians and percentages below Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) were reported for selected micronutrients, including calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin C. For sodium and potassium, the means and the distribution of intakes were compared to the Adequate Intake (AI) level. The average usual daily intakes of all micronutrients increase with age, and the intakes of boys were found to be higher than girls in the same age group. The average calcium intake increased from 272 mg/day in 4–6 years to 391 mg/day in 14–17 years, but the percentage of inadequate calcium intake remained very high (>96%). The prevalence of inadequacy of calcium was the highest among the mineral nutrients reported in this study. As the requirements of micronutrients increased with age, the percentage of subjects with inadequate intake increased in the 11–17 years age groups. Among 14–17 years group, the percentages of study participants with dietary intakes of calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin C below the EAR were 96.8%, 18.8%, 37.6%, 72.8%, 36.8%, 91.8%. 85.9% and 75.5%, respectively. Among 11–13 years group, the percentages of study participants with dietary intakes of iron, zinc and vitamin A below the EAR were 23.5%, 41.5%, and 41.6%, respectively. Thus, micronutrient deficiency is a problem in Chinese children. Nutrition education and intervention programs are needed to address these nutritional gaps.","China, Inadequacies, Micronutrients, Usual daily intake",,,,,,,,"<Very low adequacy of micronutrient intakes by young children and women in rural bangladesh is primarily explained by low food intake and limited diversity, {eid: 84873028723}>, <Poor micronutrient intake and status is a public health problem among adolescent Mozambican girls, {eid: 84938749978}>, <Longitudinal assessment of micronutrient intake among african-american and white girls: The national heart, lung, and blood institute growth and health study, {eid: 34250864435}>, <Micronutrient intakes among children and adults in Greece: The role of age, sex and socio-economic status, {eid: 84908190375}>, <Maternal and child undernutrition: Global and regional exposures and health consequences, {eid: 38349061342}>, <Ethnic variation in cardiovascular disease risk factors among children and young adults: Findings from the third national health and nutrition examination survey, 1988–1994, {eid: 0033577289}>, <Protein and micronutrient intakes are associated with child growth and morbidity from infancy to adulthood in the Philippines, {eid: 84959317127}>, <Suboptimal micronutrient intake among children in Europe, {eid: 84929331533}>, <Dynamics of the nutrition transition toward the animal foods sector in China and its implications: A worried perspective, {eid: 0242442542}>, <Secular trends in meat and seafood consumption patterns among Chinese adults, 1991–2011, {eid: 84922218050}>, <Dynamic shifts in Chinese eating behaviors.

It helps decision-makers to develop effective flood prevention and management plans. In this study, flood inventory data were prepared based on the historical and field surveys data by Sari municipality and regional water company of Mazandaran, Iran. The collected flood data accompanied with different variables (digital elevation model and slope have been considered as topographic variables, land use/land cover, precipitation, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel and depth to groundwater as environmental variables) were applied to novel hybridized model based on neural network and swarm intelligence-grey wolf algorithm (NN-SGW) to map flood-inundation. Several confusion matrix criteria were used for accuracy evaluation by cutoff-dependent and independent metrics (e.g., efficiency (E), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)). The accuracy of the flood inundation map produced by the NN-SGW model was compared with that of maps produced by four state-of-the-art benchmark models: random forest (RF), logistic model tree (LMT), classification and regression trees (CART), and J48 decision tree (J48DT). The NN-SGW model outperformed all benchmark models in both training (E = 90.5%, PPV = 93.7%, NPV = 87.3%, AUC = 96.3%) and validation (E = 79.4%, PPV = 85.3%, NPV = 73.5%, AUC = 88.2%). As the NN-SGW model produced the most accurate flood-inundation map, it can be employed for robust flood contingency planning. Based on the obtained results from NN-SGW model, distance from channel, distance from river, and depth to groundwater were identified as the most important variables for spatial prediction of urban flood inundation. This work can serve as a basis for future studies seeking to predict flood susceptibility in urban areas using hybridized machine learning (ML) models and can also be applied in other urban areas where flood inundation presents a pressing challenge, and there are some problems regarding required model and availability of input data.","Confusion matrix, Flood inundation, Flood inventory, GIS,

Gas hydrate in fine-grained sediments is very heterogeneous, and its physical properties are different from those of oil and gas reservoirs. The reliability of the classical logging saturation evaluation models established for diagenetic reservoirs is questionable. This study used four wells in GMGS3 and GMGS4 to evaluate the effects of the application of three typical methods for evaluating saturation with different principles in the unconsolidated fine-grained sediments: nuclear magnetic logging, sigma logging, and the Archie formula. It was found that the value of the lithologic capture cross-section in sigma logging and the rock’s electrical parameters in the Archie formula affect the accuracy of the model. Therefore, to obtain a reliable saturation value for fine-grained sediments, an innovative method for the calculation of resistivity and acoustic time is proposed to estimate gas hydrate saturation based on logging data, which is most consistent with the results of core analysis. The overall relative error of the verification well was 5.87%, whereas that of the density NMR logging method was 56%, showing that the accuracy of the newly proposed resistivity DT logging method’s saturation formula was significantly improved. Finally, a new model-based cross chart was developed, which can rapidly differentiate gas saturation during drilling.","gas hydrate saturation, gas hydrates, resistivity and acoustic time calculation method, South China Sea, well log",,,,,,,,"<Gas hydrates-geological perspective and global change, {eid: 0027808041, doi: 10.1029/93RG00268}>, <None, {eid: 0003588755}>, <None, {eid: 85097125903}>, <Successful and surprising results for China’s first gas hydrate drilling expedition, {eid: 70349913304}>, <Evaluation and comparison of the gas production potential of the typical four gas hydrate deposits in Shenhu area, South China sea, {eid: 85085700008}>, <The second natural gas hydrate production test in the South China Sea, {eid: 85096608877, doi: 10.31035/cg2020043}>, <The in-situ NMR evidence of gas hydrate forming in micro-pores in the Shenhu area, South China Sea, {eid: 85124645464, doi: 10.1016/j.egyr.2022.01.097}>, <Velocity structure of a gas hydrate reflector, {eid: 0027338997, doi: 10.1126/science.260.5105.204}>, <Methane hydrate and free gas on the Blake Ridge from vertical seismic profiling, {eid: 0029664226, doi: 10.1126/science.273.5283.1840}>, <A seismic study of methane hydrate marine bottom simulating reflectors, {eid: 0026491932, doi: 10.1029/92JB00234}>, <Distribution and Characteristics of Mud Diapirs, Gas Chimneys, and Bottom Simulating Reflectors Associated with Hydrocarbon Migration and Gas Hydrate Accumulation in the Qiongdongnan Basin, Northern Slope of the South China Sea, {eid: 85056711307, doi: 10.1002/gj.3351}>, <Detection and estimation of gas hydrates using rock physics and seismic inversion: Examples from the northern deep-water Gulf of Mexico, {eid: 0346500575, doi: 10.1190/1.1645456}>, <Exploration for gas hydrates in the deepwater, northern Gulf of Mexico: Part I.

In order to manage and maintain the ecosystem in the lakes, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the nutrients as well as the factors affecting the algae growth seasonally. In this study, an ecosystem model based on the genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of the parameters during the model validation was developed to simulate the growth of algae groups (green algae, blue-green algae, and diatom algae) and analyze the principal factors affecting their growth in a eutrophic shallow lake in the inner Hanoi City. The survey of each algal group and other related variables of water quality were conducted from May 2017 to March 2018 to calibrate and verify the developed model. The principal factors affecting the algae growth were evaluated through the functions that limit their growth. Seasonal variation in the production components (including diffusion from sediment, atmosphere, and algae excretion) and consumption (photosynthesis) of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) are also quantified. Moreover, the model developed in this study promises to be a useful tool to simulate the relationship between algae biomass and nutrient concentration, as well as forecasting changes in composition and density of algae in the eutrophic lakes.","Algae, Dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), Ecosystem model, Eutrophication, Nutrients",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003536372}>, <None, {eid: 0003921418}>, <A bio-physical coastal ecosystem model for assessing environmental effects of marine bivalve aquaculture, {eid: 13844320990, doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.08.018}>, <Variation in microcytin concentrations in water environment of the Hoan Kiem lake, {eid: 85093822499}>, <Analysis of seasonal changes in water qualities in eutrophic reservoirs in a flat low-lying agricultural area using an algae-based ecosystem model, {eid: 84885134223, doi: 10.1002/ird.1770}>, <Evaluation of water quality environment in eutrophic reservoirs using an ecosystem model, {eid: 78650684533}>, <None, {eid: 85035772344}>, <None, {eid: 85093824187}>, <Recalibration of the Lake Okeechobee Water Quality Model (LOWQM) to extreme hydro-meteorological events, {eid: 84956907160, doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.01.007}>, <Some primary characteristics of water quality in a closed water body in Sasaguri, Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, {eid: 33845602273}>, <The initial result of development of k–ε model for simulation of hydrodynamics in lakes toward to simulation of their water quality, {eid: 84897866858}>, <Evaluation of the water-quality dynamics in a eutrophic agricultural pond by using a one-box ecosystem model considering several algal groups, {eid: 78650703461, doi: 10.1007/s10333-010-0209-3}>, <Application of a simple genetic algorithm for the calibration of aquatic ecosystem model ofan agricultural pond, {eid: 84892434331}>, <Assessment of the trophic status in some lakes within Hanoi inner city, {eid: 85093833590, doi: 10.15625/0866-708X/55/1/8575}>, <None, {eid: 29144438475}>, <None, {eid: 0003927743}>, <Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms, {eid: 0028409149, doi: 10.1109/21.286385}>, <Notes on some theoretical problems in production ecology, {eid: 0008211289}>, <Estimating the organic carbon content of phytoplankton from cell volume or plasma volume, {eid: 84889559557, doi: 10.4319/lo.1967.12.3.0411}>, <Some characteristics of eutrophication in a shallow lake in Hanoi, {eid: 85093820622}>, <A genetic algorithm tutorial, {eid: 0002338687}>, <Water quality assessment analysis by using combination of Bayesian and genetic algorithm approach in an urban lake, China, {eid: 84991069379, doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.08.016}>, <Development of a two-dimensional eutrophication model in an urban lake (China) and the application of uncertainty analysis, {eid: 85007277371}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,2020-11-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85093847384

When prevention of exotic species from entering into a country fails at the national level and the species establishes, reproduces, spreads, and becomes invasive, the most successful action at a local level is early detection followed by eradication. We have developed a simple geographic information system (GIS) analysis for developing watch lists for early detection of invasive exotic plants that relies upon currently available species distribution data coupled with environmental data to aid in describing coarse-scale potential distributions. This GIS analysis tool develops environmental envelopes for species based upon the known distribution of a species thought to be invasive and represents the first approximation of its potential habitat while the necessary data are collected to perform more in-depth analyses. To validate this method we looked at a time series of species distributions for 66 species in Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountain counties. The time series analysis presented here did select counties that the invasive exotic weeds invaded in subsequent years, showing that this technique could be useful in developing watch lists for the spread of particular exotic species. We applied this same habitat-matching model based upon bioclimatic envelopes to 100 invasive exotics with various levels of known distributions within continental U.S. counties. For species with climatically limited distributions, county watch lists describe county-specific vulnerability to invasion. Species with matching habitats in a county would be added to that county's list. These watch lists can influence management decisions for early warning, control prioritization, and targeted research to determine specific locations within vulnerable counties. This tool provides useful information for rapid assessment of the potential distribution based upon climate envelopes of current distributions for new invasive exotic species. © 2010 Weed Science Society of America.","Exotic species, geographic information system, invasive species, iterative sampling, modeling, rapid assessment, weeds",,,,,,,,"<The art and science of weed mapping, {eid: 38449096957}>, <Presence-absence versus presence-only modelling methods for predicting bird habitat suitability, {eid: 3042679203}>, <Application and evaluation of classification trees for screening unwanted plants, {eid: 33746255850}>, <Lag times and exotic species: The ecology and management of biological invasions in slow-motion, {eid: 26944461567}>, <Application of common predictive habitat techniques for post-border weed risk management, {eid: 38849197019}>, <High-quality spatial climate data sets for the United States and beyond, {eid: 0034471718}>, <Novel methods improve prediction of species distributions from occurrence data, {eid: 33645917058}>, <Modelling invasion for a habitat generalist and a specialist plant species, {eid: 49549124938}>, <Prediction and validation of the potential global distribution of a problematic alien invasive species - The American bullfrog, {eid: 34250363584}>, <A review of methods for the assessment of prediction errors in conservation presence/absence models, {eid: 0030953391}>, <Dealing with uncertain absences in habitat modelling: A case study of a rare ground-dwelling parrot, {eid: 35448961681}>, <None, {eid: 78650186726}>, <Assessing habitatsuitability models with a virtual species, {eid: 0035891825}>, <Historical bias in biodiversity inventories affects the observed environmental niche of the species, {eid: 45749100416}>, <Biota of North America program county weed database, {eid: 78650181335}>, <Biota of North America program county weed database, {eid: 78650219826}>, <Predicting invasions by woody species in a temperate zone: A test of three risk assessment schemes in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), {eid: 33646248094}>, <Forecasting biological invasions with increasing international trade, {eid: 0037327010}>, <Biological invasions: Recommendations for U.

For magnetometer systems, the most significant improvements include development of denser magnetometer arrays and vertical gradiometer configurations. In prototype analyses and recent Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) assessments using new production systems the greatest sensitivity has been achieved with a vertical gradiometer configuration, despite model-based survey design results which suggest that dense total-field arrays would be superior. As effective as magnetometer systems have proven to be at many sites, they are inadequate at sites where basalts and other ferrous geologic formations or soils produce anomalies that approach or exceed those of target ordnance items. Additionally, magnetometer systems are ineffective where detection of non-ferrous ordnance items is of primary concern. Recent completion of the Battelle TEM-8 airborne time-domain electromagnetic system represents the culmination of nearly nine years of assessment and development of airborne electromagnetic systems for UXO mapping and detection. A recent ESTCP demonstration of this system in New Mexico showed that it was able to detect 99% of blind-seeded ordnance items, 81mm and larger, and that it could be used to map in detail a bombing target on a basalt flow where previous airborne magnetometer surveys had failed. The probability of detection for the TEM-8 in the blind-seeded study area was better than that reported for a dense-array total-field magnetometer demonstration of the same blind-seeded site, and the TEM-8 system successfully detected these items with less than half as many anomaly picks as the dense-array total-field magnetometer system. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","airborne, detection, electromagnetic, geophysics, magnetic, unexploded ordnance, UXO, wide-area assessment",,,,,,,,"<A field evaluation of airborne techniques for detection of unexploded ordnance, {eid: 2142773363}>, <Comparison of towed and mounted helicopter magnetometer systems for UXO detection, {eid: 0005837333}>, <Evaluation of improved airborne techniques for detection of UXO, {eid: 17044435544}>, <Technical Report: Analysis of Airborne Magnetometer Data from Tests at Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico, February 2003, {eid: 79957986361}>, <Analysis of correlated noise in airborne magnetic gradients for UXO detection, {eid: 4944236481}>, <Results of an Airborne Vertical Magnetic Gradient Demonstration, New Mexico, {eid: 55349093036}>, <None, {eid: 84880862604}>, <Optimal sensor configurations for total-field magnetometers, {eid: 58049188605}>, <Viability of an airborne electromagnetic system for mapping of shallow buried metals, {eid: 37549037742}>, <Field Tests of an Experimental Helicopter Time-Domain Electromagnetic System for Unexploded Ordnance Detection, {eid: 17044409214}>, <Performance of TEM-8 Airborne Electromagnetic System for UXO Detection, {eid: 79958004767}>, <Performance Assessment of a New Boom-Mounted Airborne Time-Domain Electromagnetic System, {eid: 84867280300}>",,,,,,2010-04-05,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-79957975313

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Exchanges between coastal regions and the open ocean are often associated with intermittent and localized processes such as eddies, fronts, and filaments. Since these features are difficult to observe, their impact has been predominantly investigated using numerical models and remote sensing. In this study, satellite sea surface temperature maps, Lagrangian surface drifter trajectories, and ship-based surveys of currents and hydrography from the Latex10 campaign are used to quantify cross-shelf exchanges associated with a temperature front in the western Gulf of Lion. Satellite imagery and thermosalinograph sections provide the characterization of the various water masses associated with the front. Lagrangian drifter trajectories are used to identify the main transport structures and to quantify the velocity components associated with near-inertial oscillations. These are removed from the instantaneous ADCP observations with which the cross-shelf exchanges are then computed. The results indicate an average outflow of 0.074 ± 0.013 Sv and an inflow of 0.021 ± 0.006 Sv. Integrated over the 2 week lifetime of the front, such outflow induced a total export of ∼90 ± 14 km3 of water, indicating that three to four of such events are sufficient to completely renew the surface waters of the Gulf of Lion. The total import was ∼25 ± 7 km3, suggesting larger inflows at depth or in the eastern part of the gulf to maintain its volume balance. These in situ estimates represent a key term of comparison for the further development of numerical model-based and satellite-based studies of cross-shelf exchanges associated with this type of processes.","cross-shelf exchanges, fronts, Gulf of Lion",,,,,,,,"<On the seasonal and mesoscale variabilities of the Northern Current during the PRIMO-0 experiment in the western Mediterranean Sea, {eid: 0029477917}>, <Submesoscale vortex structures at the entrance of the Gulf of Lions in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, {eid: 77950300360}>, <The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services, {eid: 79955485534}>, <Strong intrusions of the Northern Mediterranean Current on the eastern Gulf of Lion: Insights from in-situ observations and high resolution numerical modelling, {eid: 84957569781}>, <Ocean margins as a significant source of organic matter to the deep open ocean, {eid: 0032473974}>, <The shelf edge exchange processes experiment, SEEP-II: An introduction to hypotheses, results and conclusions, {eid: 0028581116}>, <The Coastal Transition Zone program, {eid: 0000680310}>, <Nutrients and plankton spatial distributions induced by a coastal eddy in the Gulf of Lion.

To investigate the effect of initial defects on the damage crack classification of the CTB, different contents of air-entraining agent (AEA) were added during the manufacturing process of the CTB to simulate the generation of different degrees of initial defects inside the CTB. Uniaxial compression and acoustic emission monitoring tests were conducted on CTB with different AEA contents using MTS microcomputer-controlled electronic universal testing machine and Micro-II Express Digital AE System. A Gaussian hybrid crack classification model based on EM algorithm, K-means algorithm, and moving average filtering method was established, and the crack classification results of RA-AF analysis method for conventional crack classification and Gaussian hybrid model were compared and analyzed. The results show that the addition of AEA makes the CTB dominated by shear cracks in the compaction stage. The dominance of the two types of cracks in the intermediate loading stage appears to be switched twice. The increase of the percentage of shear cracks has a certain hysteresis effect with the increase of the content of AEA. The percentage of shear cracks in the CTB in the intermediate and final loading stages also increases. The results not only address the challenge of determining the segmentation line for conventional crack classification but also enable real-time prediction of CTB crack evolution underground in mines.","Acoustic emission, Cemented tailings backfill, Crack classification, Gaussian mixed model, Initial defects",,,,,,,,"<In situ monitoring and analysis of the mining-induced deep ground movement

Compared to satellite hyperspectral, UAV hyperspectral has a greater image spatial resolution, but it also collects more impurity information along with more image detail information. The nitrogen (N) content in shallow soils is of great significance for crop growth, and most of its remote sensing inversions are currently based on satellite images, whereas relatively few studies have used hyperspectral UAV images in the near-infrared band for inversions. Based on this, we propose a high-accuracy inversion model based on UAV hyperspectral imagery using an elastic net (EN) dimensionality reduction algorithm combined with a decision tree (DT) model. In this study, a hyperspectral imager carried by a drone was used to acquire the surface soil spectral data of winter wheat in the study area after sowing and fertilizing, and the measured N content of the sampled soil was determined by chemical analysis methods. We used various pre-processing methods to denoise and reduce the dimensionality of the original hyperspectral images and utilized a DT regression model to construct an inversion model of N content with different preprocessing results. Then we compared the accuracy of the models and used the optimal model to obtain the spatial distribution map of soil N content in the study area. The results show that (1) the dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data can effectively remove redundant information and prevent data overfitting. Among them, the successive projections algorithm and correlation analysis method are more suitable for analyzing pre-processed spectral data, whereas the Lasso and EN algorithms are more suitable for processing original spectral data. (2) For the original spectral images, the EN dimensionality reduction algorithm (R2 of the EN-Unt-DT inversion model is 0.930, RMSE is 0.045) performed better than the other three algorithms. For the pre-processed spectral images, the successive projections algorithm (R2 of the SPA-Pre-DT inversion model is 0.906, RMSE is 0.055) performed better than the other three algorithms. The constructed EN-Unt-DT inversion model had the highest fitting accuracy. The research results provide a corresponding technical reference for the inversion of soil N content using UAV NIR hyperspectral data.","Dimensionality reduction, Hyperspectral inversion, Nitrogen

Moreover, few papers have discussed the applicability of the ensemble learning model in landslide susceptibility mapping at the township level. This study aims at defining a robust ensemble framework that can become the benchmark method for future research dealing with the comparison of different ensemble models. For this purpose, the present work focuses on three different basic classifiers: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) and two homogeneous ensemble models such as random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The hierarchical construction of deep ensemble relied on two leading ensemble technologies (i.e., homogeneous/heterogeneous model ensemble and bagging, boosting, stacking ensemble strategy) to provide a more accurate and effective spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The selected study area is Dazhou town, located in the Jurassic red-strata area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China, which is a strategic economic area currently characterized by widespread landslide risk. Based on a long-term field investigation, the inventory counting thirty-three slow-moving landslide polygons was drawn. The results show that the ensemble models do not necessarily perform better; for instance, the Bagging based DT-SVM-MLPNN-XGBoost model performed worse than the single XGBoost model. Amongst the eleven tested models, the Stacking based RF-XGBoost model, which is a homogeneous model based on bagging, boosting, and stacking ensemble, showed the highest capability of predicting the landslide-affected areas. Besides, the factor behaviors of DT, SVM, MLPNN, RF and XGBoost models reflected the characteristics of slow-moving landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area, wherein unfavorable lithological conditions and intense human engineering activities (i.e., reservoir water level fluctuation, residential area construction, and farmland development) are proven to be the key triggers. The presented approach could be used for landslide spatial occurrence prediction in similar regions and other fields.","Ensemble learning framework, Landslide susceptibility mapping, Three Gorges

Austin State University>, <College of Economics and Management, China Jiliang University>",,"© 2023 by the authors.Landslides are a common geodynamic phenomenon that cause substantial life and property damage worldwide. In the present study, we developed models to evaluate landslide susceptibility in forest-covered areas in Lin’an, southeastern China using logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) techniques. In addition to conventional landslide-related natural and human disturbance factors, factors describing forest cover, including forest type (two plantations (hickory and bamboo) and four natural forests (conifer, hardwood, shrub, and moso bamboo) and understory vegetation conditions, were included as predictors. Model performance was evaluated based on true-positive rate, Kappa value, and area under the ROC curve using a 10-fold cross-validation method. All models exhibited good performance with measures of ≥0.70, although the LR model was relatively inferior. The key predictors were forest type, understory vegetation height (UVH), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in summer, distance to road (DTRD), and maximum daily rainfall (MDR). Hickory plantations yielded the highest landslide probability, while conifer and hardwood forests had the lowest values. Bamboo plantations had probability results comparable to those of natural forests. Using the RF model, areas with a shorter UVH (<1.2 m), a lower NDVI (<0.70), a heavier MDR (>115 mm), or a shorter DTRD (<500 m) were predicted to be landslide-prone. Information on forest cover is essential for predicting landslides in areas with rich forest cover, and conversion from natural forests to plantations could increase landslide risk. Across the study areas, the northwestern part was the most landslide-prone. In terms of landslide prevention, the RF model-based map produced the most accurate predictions for the “very high” category of landslide. These results will help us better understand landslide occurrences in forest-covered areas and provide valuable information for governments in designing disaster mitigation.","decision tree, forest

Computational models of smoking can provide estimates of the projected impact of tobacco control policies and can be used to inform public health decision making. We outline a protocol for simulating the effects of tobacco policies on population health outcomes. Methods and analysis We extend the Smoking History Generator (SHG), a microsimulation model based on data from the National Health Interview Surveys, to evaluate the effects of tobacco control policies on projections of smoking prevalence and mortality in the USA. The SHG simulates individual life trajectories including smoking initiation, cessation and mortality. We illustrate the application of the SHG policy module for four types of tobacco control policies at the national and state levels: Smoke-free air laws, cigarette taxes, increasing tobacco control programme expenditures and raising the minimum age of legal access to tobacco. Smoking initiation and cessation rates are modified by age, birth cohort, gender and years since policy implementation. Initiation and cessation rate modifiers are adjusted for differences across age groups and the level of existing policy coverage. Smoking prevalence, the number of population deaths avoided, and life-years gained are calculated for each policy scenario at the national and state levels. The model only considers direct individual benefits through reduced smoking and does not consider benefits through reduced exposure to secondhand smoke. Ethics and dissemination A web-based interface is being developed to integrate the results of the simulations into a format that allows the user to explore the projected effects of tobacco control policies in the USA. Usability testing is being conducted in which experts provide feedback on the interface. Development of this tool is under way, and a publicly accessible website is available at http://www.tobaccopolicyeffects.org.","cigarette tax, microsimulation, minimum age of legal access to tobacco, policy simulation, smoke-free air law, tobacco control policy",,,,,,,,"<Tobacco control and the reduction in smoking-related premature deaths in the United States 1964-2012, {eid: 84891952773}>, <None, {eid: 84893235639}>, <None, {eid: 85053069863}>, <Current Cigarette Smoking among Adults-United States 2005-2015, {eid: 84995481243}>, <None, {eid: 85053061554}>, <None, {eid: 85022101322}>, <None, {eid: 85042792066}>, <State tobacco control program spending-United States, 2011, {eid: 84936146371}>, <None, {eid: 85053069157}>, <Computational models used to assess us tobacco control policies, {eid: 85032834871}>, <Mathematical modeling in tobacco control research: Initial results from a systematic review, {eid: 84962911434}>, <Has smoking cessation ceased?

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license.Background Across low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), one in ten deaths in children younger than 5 years is attributable to diarrhoea. The substantial between-country variation in both diarrhoea incidence and mortality is attributable to interventions that protect children, prevent infection, and treat disease. Identifying subnational regions with the highest burden and mapping associated risk factors can aid in reducing preventable childhood diarrhoea. Methods We used Bayesian model-based geostatistics and a geolocated dataset comprising 15 072 746 children younger than 5 years from 466 surveys in 94 LMICs, in combination with findings of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, to estimate posterior distributions of diarrhoea prevalence, incidence, and mortality from 2000 to 2017. From these data, we estimated the burden of diarrhoea at varying subnational levels (termed units) by spatially aggregating draws, and we investigated the drivers of subnational patterns by creating aggregated risk factor estimates. Findings The greatest declines in diarrhoeal mortality were seen in south and southeast Asia and South America, where 54·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38·1-65·8), 17·4% (7·7-28·4), and 59·5% (34·2-86·9) of units, respectively, recorded decreases in deaths from diarrhoea greater than 10%. Although children in much of Africa remain at high risk of death due to diarrhoea, regions with the most deaths were outside Africa, with the highest mortality units located in Pakistan. Indonesia showed the greatest within-country geographical inequality; some regions had mortality rates nearly four times the average country rate. Reductions in mortality were correlated to improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) or reductions in child growth failure (CGF). Similarly, most high-risk areas had poor WASH, high CGF, or low oral rehydration therapy coverage. Interpretation By co-analysing geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden and its key risk factors, we could assess candidate drivers of subnational death reduction. Further, by doing a counterfactual analysis of the remaining disease burden using key risk factors, we identified potential intervention strategies for vulnerable populations. In view of the demands for limited resources in LMICs, accurately quantifying the burden of diarrhoea and its drivers is important for precision public health.",,,,,,,,,"<Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality for 282 causes of death in 195 countries and territories, 1980–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, {eid: 85056166310}>, <Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, {eid: 85056201393}>, <Quantifying risks and interventions that have affected the burden of diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years: an analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, {eid: 85076157849}>, <Estimates of global, regional, and national morbidity, mortality, and aetiologies of diarrhoeal diseases: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, {eid: 85029667945}>, <Ending preventable child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2025: the integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD), {eid: 84876898533}>, <Global burden of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea, {eid: 84876285802}>, <Associations of suboptimal growth with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in children under five years: a pooled analysis of ten prospective studies, {eid: 84878471170}>, <Rotavirus vaccination and the global burden of rotavirus diarrhea among children younger than 5 years, {eid: 85052704305}>, <Water, sanitation and hygiene for the prevention of diarrhoea, {eid: 77951626069}>, <The effect of oral rehydration solution and recommended home fluids on diarrhoea mortality, {eid: 77951636176}>, <Replacement of water and electrolyte losses in cholera by an oral glucose–electrolyte solution, {eid: 0014531255}>, <Oral fluid therapy of cholera among Bangladesh refugees, {eid: 0015833761}>, <An analytical framework for the study of child survival in developing countries, {eid: 0021533494}>, <Mapping under-5 and neonatal mortality in Africa, 2000–15: a baseline analysis for the Sustainable Development Goals, {eid: 85029910207}>, <Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015, {eid: 85042778719}>, <Mapping local variation in educational attainment across Africa, {eid: 85042803412}>, <Data can help to end malnutrition across Africa, {eid: 85042796093}>, <The effect of malaria control on Plasmodium falciparum in Africa between 2000 and 2015, {eid: 84944195470}>, <Mapping diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine coverage in Africa, 2000–2016: a spatial and temporal modelling study, {eid: 85064920040}>, <None, {eid: 85187512799}>, <Variation in childhood diarrheal morbidity and mortality in Africa, 2000–2015, {eid: 85053833256}>, <Impact of drinking water, sanitation and handwashing with soap on childhood diarrhoeal disease: updated meta-analysis and meta-regression, {eid: 85045849126}>, <Scaling up access to oral rehydration solution for diarrhea: learning from historical experience in low- and high-performing countries, {eid: 84880887065}>, <Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality and life expectancy, 1950–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, {eid: 85056148226}>, <Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting: the GATHER statement, {eid: 84979680780}>, <Measuring performance on the Healthcare Access and Quality Index for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational locations: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, {eid: 85047728707}>, <Linear models with R: chapter 4, problems with the predictors, {eid: 28444464728}>, <Improved prediction accuracy for disease risk mapping using Gaussian process stacked generalization, {eid: 85031093066}>, <Bayesian computing with INLA: new features, {eid: 84878373364}>, <Approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models by using integrated nested Laplace approximations, {eid: 62849120031}>, <GBD 2010: design, definitions, and metrics, {eid: 84871047327}>, <Income inequality measures, {eid: 34848850438}>, <The Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL), {eid: 84948994563}>, <Combined MODIS 5.1.

IUU fishing promotes fraudulent mislabeling of seafood, which can pose serious risks to consumers’ health if specimens being traded originate from contaminated areas. The development and optimization of reliable tools to confirm the geographic origin of seafood is therefore of utmost importance under these scenarios. These tools are usually based in reference models of a given species that allows to trace the geographic origin of conspecifics. However, to date, the accuracy of such reference models requires the sampling of specimens of the species being surveyed, an issue that may impair the generalized use of this approach by authorities under real-case scenarios. A potential way to overcome this constraint is to apply a model built for a given species (working as surrogate) to trace the geographic origin of another one. The present study evaluated the effect of species-specific and spatial variability associated with the elemental fingerprints (EF) of shells of three commercially important bivalve species (Cerastoderma edule, Ruditapes decussatus and R. philippinarum) from five different locations over the northwestern and western Iberian coast and tested if a reference model based on one of this species could be used to reliably trace the geographic origin of specimens from the two other species. The EF of shells of the three species were significantly different within each location, as well as among different locations within each species. The reference models of the three species presented high cross-validation accuracy (ranging from 95.3% to 99.3%). The tests to infer if these models could reliably trace the geographic origin of samples from another species presented an overall accuracy ranging between 50% and 82.3%. Based on these results, and other requirements that a surrogate species must fulfil, it is possible to conclude that the three species hold the potential to be used as surrogates of each other, although C. edule is the one that better fulfills the requirements of a surrogate species. The optimization proposed in this study improves the cost-efficiency of using EF of bivalve shells as a tool to trace and confirm the geographic origin of bivalves, while also allowing to deliver a prompter reply to authorities.","Food safety, ICP-MS, IUU fishing, Mislabeling, Seafood, Species-specific",,,,,,,,"<Sources of rare earth elements in shells and soft-tissues of bivalves from Tokyo Bay, {eid: 85019866269, doi: 10.1016/j.marchem.2017.02.009}>, <None, {eid: 85111924529}>, <Trace element fingerprinting of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) shells and soft tissues successfully reveals harvesting locations, {eid: 85066452168, doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.233}>, <Random forests, {eid: 0035478854, doi: 10.1201/9780367816377-11}>, <None, {eid: 85111945344}>, <On the use of surrogate species in conservation biology, {eid: 0032803483, doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98338.x}>, <None, {eid: 85111912791}>, <The utility of discriminant analysis to determine the geographic origin of commercially important seafood and aquaculture species: a meta-analysis, {eid: 85100795973, doi: 10.1080/23308249.2021.1882935}>, <None, {eid: 85111920697}>, <None, {eid: 85111919275}>, <None, {eid: 85111907768}>, <None, {eid: 85111913004}>, <None, {eid: 85089011038}>, <None, {eid: 85111908879}>, <The seafood supply chain from a fraudulent perspective, {eid: 85052242723, doi: 10.5505/turkhijyen.2018.75508}>, <Determining the provenance and authenticity of seafood: a review of current methodologies, {eid: 85069805999, doi: 10.1016/j.tifs.2019.07.010}>, <Fish product mislabelling: failings of traceability in the production chain and implications for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, {eid: 84903398850, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098691}>, <Origin identification method by multiple trace elemental analysis of short-neck clams produced in Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea, {eid: 84887584388, doi: 10.1007/s12562-013-0659-9}>, <None, {eid: 85111946217}>, <None, {eid: 77958158373}>, <None, {eid: 85111906496}>, <None, {eid: 84929516184}>, <Approaches to combatting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, {eid: 85105559346, doi: 10.1038/s43016-020-0121-y}>, <Biology of the common cockle Cerastoderma edule (Linnaeus, 1758) in Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal): implications for fisheries management, {eid: 85103726716, doi: 10.1016/j.seares.2021.102024}>, <Revealing the illegal harvesting of Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) using fatty acid profiles of the adductor muscle, {eid: 85087943817, doi: 10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107368}>, <Trace and minor element records in aragonitic bivalve shells as environmental proxies, {eid: 85060644279, doi: 10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.01.008}>, <Interspecific patterns of trace elements in sea ducks: can surrogate species be used in contaminants monitoring?, {eid: 85057850518, doi: 10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.11.023}>, <Spatio-temporal trace element fingerprinting of king scallops (Pecten maximus) reveals harvesting period and location, {eid: 85071609761, doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121}>, <None, {eid: 85111932873}>, <None, {eid: 85111929958}>, <IUU fishing and seafood fraud: using crime script analysis to inform intervention, {eid: 85052133894, doi: 10.1177/0002716218784533}>, <An evaluation of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios as environmental proxies in aragonite bivalve shells, {eid: 84922619554, doi: 10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.12.019}>, <None, {eid: 85111931693}>, <Trace element fingerprinting of cockle (Cerastoderma edule) shells can reveal harvesting location in adjacent areas, {eid: 84936860418, doi: 10.1038/srep11932}>, <Cost-efficiency improvement of bivalves shells preparation when tracing their geographic origin through ICP-MS analysis of elemental fingerprints, {eid: 85086469303, doi: 10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107383}>, <Spatio-temporal variability of trace elements fingerprints in cockle (Cerastoderma edule) shells and its relevance for tracing geographic origin, {eid: 85020547333, doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-03381-w}>, <Molluscs as archives of environmental change, {eid: 0000883334}>, <Collateral damage?

Author(s).Background: Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15–59 years across SSA. Methods: We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. Results: We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group. Conclusions: As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.","Africa, Demographics, Geostatistics, HIV, HIV prevalence,

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: High-resolution estimates of HIV burden across space and time provide an important tool for tracking and monitoring the progress of prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15–49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000–18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit. Findings: The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second-level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2·8 (95% uncertainty interval 2·1–3·8) in Mauritania to 1585·9 (1369·4–1824·8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0·8 (0·7–0·9) in Mauritania to 676·5 (513·6–888·0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661·7 [2544·8–8120·3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163·0 [679·0–1866·8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81·1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81·4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020. Interpretation: Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas.

The model utilizes machine learning techniques and employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and decision tree (DT) based architecture following a matrix-to-matrix mapping strategy to establish the underlying spatial–temporal relationship between the wind and wave fields for four-day and ocean-scale forecasts. The training and testing of the model were carried out using long-term hindcast wave and wind datasets released by ERA5. A rectangular sea region covering an area of 5° × 5°in the Pearl River Estuary was regarded as the modeling domain. The data-driven model was validated against a 10 years of historical hindcast data, and the global errors were analyzed. The forecasting performance of the established model for tropical cyclone wave events was investigated in terms of both the spatial pattern and temporal variance of the SWH, MWP, and MWD. Extreme waves were generated using the proposed model and compared with the original hindcast results. The data-driven model showed promising potential for accurately capturing ambiguous patterns and features that are variant in both spatial and temporal dimensions, and exhibited obvious superiority over numerical wave modeling in terms of computational efficiency.","Cross validation, Decision trees, Machine learning, MLP, Wave forecast",,,,,,,,"<The ERA5 global reanalysis: Preliminary extension to 1950, {eid: 85114701588, doi: 10.1002/qj.4174}>, <Ocean wave energy forecasting using optimised deep learning neural networks, {eid: 85097669675, doi: 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.108372}>, <Application of neural networks and support vector machine for significant wave height prediction, {eid: 85019141349, doi: 10.1016/j.oceano.2017.03.007}>, <A third-generation wave model for coastal regions: 1.

The computational challenges associated with these models can be addressed through emulation. In the land-use/water-quality context, the linear relation between nitrate loading and surface-water/groundwater nitrate concentrations presents an opportunity for employing an efficient model emulator through the application of impulse-response matrices. When paired with first-order second-moment techniques, the emulation strategy gives rise to the “stochastic impulse-response emulator” (SIRE). SIRE is shown to facilitate non-intrusive, near-real time, and risk-based evaluation of nitrate-loading change scenarios, as well as nitrate-loading OUU subject to surface-water/groundwater concentration constraints in high decision variable and parameter dimensions. Two case studies are used to demonstrate SIRE in the nitrate-loading context.","Decision support, Emulation under uncertainty, Groundwater modeling, Nitrate, Optimization under uncertainty",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003871532}>, <Modeling nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural watersheds, {eid: 34548130164}>, <A review of surrogate models and their application to groundwater modeling, {eid: 84941985522, doi: 10.1002/2015WR016967}>, <None, {eid: 85064834884, doi: 10.1007/s00477-019-01669-z}>, <Python scripting: the return to programming, {eid: 84931456717, doi: 10.1111/gwat.12269}>, <MT3D-USGS version 1: a U.S. Geological Survey release of MT3DMS updated with new and expanded transport capabilities for use with MODFLOW, U.S, {eid: 85034251326}>, <Assessing the impact of the nitrate directive on farming systems using a bio-economic modelling chain, {eid: 78651238187}>, <Comparison of nitrate attenuation characterization methods at the uranium mill tailing site in monument valley, Arizona, {eid: 70349972509}>, <Emulator-enabled approximate bayesian computation (abc) and uncertainty analysis for computationally expensive groundwater models, {eid: 85045251129, doi: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.005}>, <Quantifying data worth toward reducing predictive uncertainty, {eid: 77955974089}>, <Ground water model calibration using pilot points and regularization, {eid: 0037373555}>, <PEST and its Utility Support Software, Theory, {eid: 84985035814}>, <Evaluating the sources of water to wells: three techniques for metamodeling of a groundwater flow model, {eid: 84951145330, doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.11.023}>, <Metamodeling for groundwater age forecasting in the lake Michigan basin, {eid: 85050354204, doi: 10.1029/2017WR022387}>, <Depletion mapping and constrained optimization to support managing groundwater extraction, {eid: 85020187113, doi: 10.1111/gwat.12536}>, <Monitoring and forecasting nitrate concentration in the groundwater using statistical process control and time series analysis: a case study, {eid: 79952004429, doi: 10.1007/s00477-010-0371-6}>, <A model for managing sources of groundwater pollution, {eid: 0020436736}>, <Optimal dynamic management of groundwater pollutant sources, {eid: 0019999479}>, <Regional oxygen reduction and denitrification rates in groundwater from multi-model residence time distributions, san joaquin valley, USA, {eid: 84969962352, doi: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.05.018}>, <Regional variability of nitrate fluxes in the unsaturated zone and groundwater, Wisconsin, USA, {eid: 85040788110, doi: 10.1002/2017WR022012}>, <Predictive uncertainty analysis of a saltwater intrusion model using null-space Monte Carlo, {eid: 79955977352, doi: 10.1029/2010WR009342}>, <Review and assessment of nitrate reduction in groundwater in the baltic sea basin, {eid: 85018473871}>, <Stream-aquifer influence coefficients as tools for simulation and management, {eid: 0020332007, doi: 10.1029/WR018i001p00168}>, <Evaluation and management of the impact of land use change on the nitrogen and phosphorus load delivered to surface waters: the export coefficient modelling approach, {eid: 0030222707}>, <Jupyter notebook open source interactive data science computing across over 40 programming languages, {eid: 84984939799}>, <Disentangling environmental and economic contributions to hydro-economic model output uncertainty: An example in the context of land-use change impact assessment, {eid: 85080085057}>, <Role of model parameterization in risk-based decision support: an empirical exploration, {eid: 85064461982, doi: 10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.04.010}>, <Efficient Posterior Exploration of a High-Dimensional Groundwater Model from Two-Stage Mcmc Simulation and Polynomial Chaos Expansion, {eid: 84878173964, doi: 10.1002/wrcr.20226}>, <Nitrogen balances and losses on intensive dairy farms, {eid: 0343694211}>, <Predicting groundwater nitrate concentrations in a region of mixed agricultural land use: a comparison of three approaches, {eid: 0034841238}>, <Geophysical Data Analysis: Discrete Inverse Theory, {eid: 0003425444}>, <Management model for controlling nitrate contamination in the New Jersey pine barrens aquifer, {eid: 0019260295}>, <Evaluation of approaches for managing nitrate loading from on-site wastewater systems near la pine, oregon, Tech. rep., {eid: 56249146386}>, <Waikato River Independent Scoping Study, Tech.

The attraction and repulsion effects of the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles are attributed to the area change in the overlapping parts of their MVIRs. A multi-vehicle interactive lane-changing method considering MVIR is proposed. A velocity change model of multi-vehicle interactive lane-changing is established to reveal the change regularity of velocity under multi-vehicle interactive lane-changing. The model parameters are calibrated using a P3-DT Beidou high-precision positioning direction finding receiver to collect vehicle coordinates and velocity. The error of vehicle velocity variation was less than 11%, which verified the validity of the velocity change model. The research results can guide drivers in completing the lanechanging process safely and quickly, and provide theoretical support for micro-traffic flow simulation, road traffic safety proactive prevention and control, multi-vehicle lane-changing rules, and multi-agent simulation platform construction.","behavioral safety analysis and program development, data analysis, data and data science, general, modeling and forecasting, quantitative analysis, safety, safety performance and analysis, statistical methods, transportation safety management systems, urban transportation data and information systems",,,,,,,,"<Driver Headway Choice: A Comparison Between Driving Simulator and Real-Road Driving, {eid: 84901600846}>, <An Empirical Analysis of Lane-Changing on Multilane Highways, {eid: 0014711692}>, <Mechanics of the Passing Maneuver and the Impact of Large Trucks, {eid: 0025399799}>, <A Model for the Structure of Lane-Changing Decisions, {eid: 0022925885}>, <Modelling Lane Changing and Merging in Microscopic Traffic Simulation, {eid: 0036816211}>, <Integrated Driving Behavior Modeling, {eid: 34247603042}>, <Estimation of an Integrated Driving Behavior Model, {eid: 67349136091}>, <A Cellular Automaton Model for Freeway Traffic, {eid: 0001232636}>, <A Cellular Automata Traffic Flow Model Combined With a BP Neural Network Based Microscopic Lane Changing Decision Model, {eid: 85069930144}>, <Cooperative Lane-Changing Rules on Multilane Under Condition of Cooperative Vehicle and Infrastructure System, {eid: 84907244644}>, <General Lane Changing Model MOBIL for Car-Following Models, {eid: 38349174591}>, <Modeling Vehicle Interactions During Lane-Changing Behavior on Arterial Streets, {eid: 78651486653}>, <Modeling Lane-Changing Behavior in a Connected Environment: A Game Theory Approach, {eid: 84942988991}>, <Parametric Study of Microscopic Two-Dimensional Traffic Flow Models: A Literature Review, {eid: 85056093193}>, <Characteristics and Models of Vehicle Lane Changing Interaction Based on Molecular Dynamics, {eid: 85070739804}>, <Bayesian Dynamic Extreme Value Modeling for Conflict-Based Real-Time Safety Analysis, {eid: 85121834454}>, <A Human-Like Game Theory-Based Controller for Automatic Lane Changing, {eid: 85044666604}>, <Concept, Principle and Modeling of Driving Risk Field Based on Driver-VehicleRoad Interaction, {eid: 84960900063}>, <Driver’s Visual Attention as a Function of Driving Experience and Visibility Using a Driving Simulator to Explore Drivers’ Eye Movements in Day, Night and Rain Driving, {eid: 77950312724}>, <Vehicle’s Velocity Time Series Prediction Using Neural Network, {eid: 84988389948}>, <Multi Parameter Prediction of Drivers’ Lane-Changing Behaviour With Neural Network Model, {eid: 84928896629}>, <Planning Method of Road Network Density Based on Urban Area Position Potential Energy, {eid: 34347263785}>, <None, {eid: 85173100007}>, <None, {eid: 85173100563}>, <Dynamic Potential-Model-Based Feature for Lane Change Prediction, {eid: 85009781678}>, <Driving Angle Prediction of Lane Changes Based on Extremely Randomized Decision Trees Considering the Harmonic Potential Field Method, {eid: 85173125080}>, <Dynamic Lane Changing Trajectory Planning for CAV: A Multi-Agent Model With Path Preplanning, {eid: 85117573044}>, <Autonomous Ground Vehicle Control System for High-Speed and Safe Operation, {eid: 52449096378}>, <Exact Robot Navigation Using Artificial Potential Functions, {eid: 0026938332}>, <Artificial Potential Functions for Highway Driving With Collision Avoidance, {eid: 51649109707}>, <Vehicle Headway Modeling and its Inferences in Macroscopic/Microscopic Traffic Flow Theory: A Survey, {eid: 85009837031}>, <Modelling Vehicular Interactions for Heterogeneous Traffic Flow Using Cellular Automata With Position Preference, {eid: 85029069076}>",,,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,2022-11-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85141744576

Although widely documented, the causes of variation in movement strategies and their potential demographic consequences are not well-understood. Here, we used GPS telemetry data and individual-based photographic surveys to describe evidence for the partial migration of giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in the tropical savanna habitat of Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda. Seasonal movements in giraffe have been described but have not been systematically investigated within the framework of partial migration. We characterized movement behaviors of eight female GPS tracked giraffe across one full year using a model-driven approach of net-squared displacement metrics. To further evaluate these space use patterns at the population-level, we used closed robust design multi-state capture recapture models derived from individually based photographic surveys collected seasonally over three years. We also characterized environmental conditions associated with seasonal space use by conducting ground-based vegetation surveys and analyzing remotely sensed phenology data. Our results from both individually based telemetry models and population-level multi-state models suggest intra-population variation in seasonal space use strategies with three dominant movement classes: (1) Residents in deciduous savanna characterized by Acacia sieberiana, Acacia senegal, Harrisonia abyssinica, and Crateva adansonii in the far western end of the park. (2) Residents in the broadleaf savannas characterized by Pseudocedrela kotschyi, Stereospermum kunthianum, Termalia spp., and Combretum spp. in the central sector of the park (3) Male-biased migrants that transitioned seasonally between the acacia savanna in the wet seasons and the broadleaf savanna in the dry seasons.

Methods: Both time and frequency domain signal pre-processing techniques are considered: noise removal, spectral analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transforms. Feature extraction and classification methods based on feature vectors using the above processing techniques are reviewed. A tensorial signal processing de-noising framework suitable for spatiotemporal association between features in MRI is also discussed. Validation: Examples where the proposed methodologies have been successful in classifying TPIs and DCE-MRIs are discussed. Results: Identifying commonalities in the structure of such heterogeneous datasets potentially leads to a unified multi-channel signal processing framework for biomedical image analysis. Conclusion: The proposed complex valued classification methodology enables fusion of entire datasets from a sequence of spatial images taken at different time stamps; this is of interest from the viewpoint of inferring disease proliferation. The approach is also of interest for other emergent multi-channel biomedical imaging modalities and of relevance across the biomedical signal processing community.","Basal cell carcinomas, Complex

Lehner D. (AUID: 57212391238),A Model-Driven Platform for Engineering Holistic Digital Twins,2023,"2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2023",0,10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00045,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00045,"<Institute of Business Informatics - Software Engineering, Johannes Kepler University, Christian Doppler Laboratory for Model-Integrated Smart Production (CDL-MINT)>",,"© 2023 IEEE.With the combination of software and physical devices into so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged to handle the resulting complexity and efficiently connect software to physical devices, the so-called physical twins (PTs). While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.","Digital Twin,

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) help them to bridge the conceptual gap between the problem and the solution domain. Engineering these languages is complex, as it requires comprehensive white-box knowledge of constituents of DSLs, i.e., syntax and semantics, and their composition and realization in respective technological spaces of language workbenches. For efficient language engineering reusing existing languages by composition is essential. For this purpose, various language composition and variability mechanisms have been developed. However, in the literature, there exists no approach enabling systematic language reuse holistically, i.e., including syntax and semantics, in a black-box fashion. We propose an approach for the systematic component-oriented reuse of DSLs (SCOLaR) that supports the integrated reuse of syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics via black-box language components that are composable along their interface in a language family. We implemented a prototypical version of our solution with the MontiCore language workbench, that supports embedding and aggregation of grammar-based languages with translational semantics realized with code-generators. In the future, we plan to improve our implementation with the support of other language workbenches and to provide a comprehensive evaluation with a series of case studies. With our work, we aim to advance the field of software language engineering by providing a novel method for black-box language reuse capturing syntax and semantics definitions for textual external, translational DSLs. This paper outlines our approach by stating the problem, motivating our research question, and proposing our solution, our plan for evaluation, and presenting expected contributions.","DSL, Language Composition, Variability",,,,,,,,"<Service-oriented Design of Metamodel Components, {eid: 84868705016}>, <None, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Supporting Efficient and Advanced Omniscient Debugging for xDSMLs, {eid: 84962499468}>, <Software and system modeling based on a unified formal semantics, {eid: 84948125395}>, <Modeling Language Variability with Reusable Language Components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <Compositional Modelling Languages with Analytics and Construction Infrastructures Based on Object-Oriented Techniques-The MontiCore Approach, {eid: 85141745542}>, <A Compositional Framework for Systematic Modeling Language Reuse, {eid: 85096955321}>, <None, {eid: 85182395159}>, <Language components for modular DSLs using traits, {eid: 84961206277}>, <Language Engineering with the GEMOC studio, {eid: 85025599751}>, <Concern-Oriented Language Development (COLD): Fostering Reuse in Language Engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <Generating Customized Low-Code Development Platforms for Digital Twins, {eid: 85129984615}>, <Language family engineering with product lines of multi-level models, {eid: 85112209800}>, <Modular Language Product Lines: A Graph Transformation Approach, {eid: 85141855113}>, <Melange: A Meta-language for Modular and Reusable Development of DSLs, {eid: 84962587279}>, <Language Composition Untangled, {eid: 84872715004}>, <The State of the Art in Language Workbenches: Conclusions from the Language Workbench Challenge, {eid: 84891295467}>, <None, {eid: 85127425328}>, <None, {eid: 85182406788}>, <Software Language Engineering in the Large: Towards Composing and Deriving Languages, {eid: 85053063379}>, <ATL: A model transformation tool, {eid: 45849085734}>, <The Spoofax Language Workbench: Rules for Declarative Specification of Languages and IDEs, {eid: 79551667411}>, <VCU: The Three Dimensions of Reuse, {eid: 84977507448}>, <Toward an Engineering Discipline for Grammarware, {eid: 33745137818}>, <The Epsilon Transformation Language, {eid: 54249141728}>, <Choosy and Picky: Configuration of Language Product Lines, {eid: 84982855913}>, <Matters of (meta-) modeling, {eid: 34248658631}>, <Facet-oriented Modelling, {eid: 85105718956}>, <Modular Language Composition for the Masses, {eid: 85058243327}>, <Digital Twin Platforms: Requirements, Capabilities, and Future Prospects, {eid: 85121363965}>, <Feature-Oriented Language Families: A Case Study, {eid: 84921051501}>, <Reverse engineering language product lines from existing DSL variants, {eid: 85019863772}>, <Leveraging Software Product Lines Engineering in the Development of external DSLs: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84994056672}>, <A Component-Based Formal Language Workbench, {eid: 85079272435}>, <Modeling Capabilities of Digital Twin Platforms-Old Wine in new Bottles?, {eid: 85133335220}>, <Towards the Black-Box Aggregation of Language Components, {eid: 85124000757}>, <Towards a Product Line Architecture for Digital Twins, {eid: 85159120968}>, <Challenges and Opportunities of Modularizing Textual Domain-Specific Languages, {eid: 85052026457}>, <Leveraging product line engineering for the development of domain-specific metamodeling languages, {eid: 85065088955}>, <Multi-purpose Syntax Definition with SDF3, {eid: 85091594415}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Neverlang: A framework for feature-oriented language development, {eid: 84938739142}>, <Variability Support in Domain-Specific Language Development, {eid: 84891322998}>, <Neverlang 2: A Framework for Modular Language Implementation, {eid: 84900017627}>, <Language and IDE Modularization and Composition with MPS, {eid: 84869792883}>, <Using Language Workbenches and Domain-Specific Languages for Safety-Critical Software Development, {eid: 85047136646}>, <Language Design with the Spoofax Language Workbench, {eid: 84907989410}>, <The State of Practice in Model-Driven Engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>, <Towards Metamodelling-In-The-Large: Interface-based Composition for Modular Metamodel Development, {eid: 84937402337}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-01,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85182403441

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.","Co-simulation, Digital Twins, Functional Mock-up Interface, Model Swap, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<A survey of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84555177840}>, <Cyber-physical systems: challenge of the 21st century, {eid: 84994378262}>, <A model-based design methodology for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 80052469409}>, <A comprehensive survey on modeling of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85055255781}>, <Integrated Tool Chain for Model-Based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85006151292}>, <Co-simulation: a Survey, {eid: 85051436184}>, <Product lifecycle management: the new paradigm for enterprises, {eid: 34047222275}>, <Multi-modelling and co-simulation in the engineering of cyber-physical systems: Towards the digital twin, {eid: 85073679094}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Towards modular digital twins of robot systems, {eid: 85143058136}>, <Recent developments in hardware-in-the-loop testing, {eid: 85061083191}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <Functional Mockup Interface 2.0: The Standard for Tool independent Exchange of Simulation Models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <The fmi 3.0 standard interface for clocked and scheduled simulations, {eid: 85124046429}>, <Towards reuse of synchronization algorithms in co-simulation frameworks, {eid: 85091582766}>, <An fmi-based initialization plugin for into-cps maestro 2, {eid: 85101498944}>, <None, {eid: 84928170648}>, <The FMI 3.0 Standard Interface for Clocked and Scheduled Simulations, {eid: 85124046429}>, <Master for co-simulation using FMI, {eid: 84908292404}>, <Formally verified fmi enabled external data broker: Rabbitmq fmu, {eid: 85099278177}>, <Rmqfmu: Bridging the real world with co-simulation for practitioners, {eid: 85146053605}>, <Design Space Exploration in the Development of Agricultural Robots, {eid: 85073686308}>, <Addressing time discrepancy between digital and physical twins, {eid: 85146053531}>, <Assured and correct dynamic update of controllers, {eid: 84974593757}>, <Model-driven engineering tools and languages for cyber-physical systems–a systematic literature review, {eid: 85103282925}>, <The disappearing boundary between development-time and run-time, {eid: 79951591300}>, <Dynamic software updating: a systematic mapping study, {eid: 85092103229}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096956543}>, <Twinops -

This paper reports on bibliometric literature analysis of MBSE of IoT. It considers conference and journal publication trends in the state-of-the-art to identify emerging research themes from the standpoint of trans/multi-disciplinary scholarship and technology. We used Elsevier's Scopus database to find relevant publications from January 2018 to December 2022. Using publication citation ranking and other factors (e.g., publication venues), we selected 110 articles and then analyzed them using BibExcel and VOSviewer software tools. With a modest decline in 2021, this analysis shows an overall increase in publications during the time period. A thematic analysis of the abstracts revealed a strong focus on the introduction of reference architectures and integration of MBSE with business and management methodologies like Agile and BPMN 2.0. Model-driven engineering and machine learning techniques are essential among the enablers for realization of complex heterogeneous IoT systems in the realm of Industry 4.0. We highlight these findings to better understand and meet the enduring challenge of scaling MBSE of IoT across diverse sectors like health, manufacturing, and transportation.","BibExcel,

Digital representation of those components through the definition of the corresponding description models starts in the early design phase of the engineering process. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach promotes increased reusability of component models and allows an automatic generation of the system of interest model and its validation through simulation, which results in a shorter design phase. However, existing solutions for CPS description models contain mainly skills and functionalities of the component from a task-oriented perspective to achieve platform-independent code generation for the components control. Semantic information in the skills description usually is completely absent or present only to the extent, which is not enough to match the corresponding components to the product requirements and necessary production processes. Instead, production cell components are manually assigned to the manufacturing processes, which are required for the product. This manual step hinders the automatic production cell model generation based on the product requirements. To allow automatic matching from product descriptions to specific CPSs, a new approach to CPS description is necessary. This description should allow the entirely automatic generation of production cell models through the matching of CPS skills and product requirements. In this paper, a semantic metamodel for CPS is presented. This metamodel enriches CPS models with high-granularity graph-based skill descriptions, which, in combination with the appropriate manufacturing process descriptions, allow automatic matching for production planning and further simulation and ontimization.","CPS, MBSE, Metamodel",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85051028888}>, <Shaping the digital twin for design and production engineering, {eid: 85018723536}>, <Simulation of production processes involving cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85020725629}>, <None, {eid: 85084925844}>, <Design techniques and applications of cyberphysical systems: A survey, {eid: 85028199291}>, <Platform architecture concept for the composition of collective cloud manufacturing, {eid: 85061804718}>, <Virtual commissioning of an assembly cell with cooperating robots, {eid: 84867792157}>, <None, {eid: 84952891989}>, <None, {eid: 85047005697}>, <Future modeling and simulation of cps-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563}>, <None, {eid: 84961142240}>, <Understanding data heterogeneity in the context of cyber-physical systems integration, {eid: 85018169091}>, <A semantic framework for modeling and simulation of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84938574926}>, <Scalable model exploration for model-driven engineering, {eid: 85024895767}>, <None, {eid: 27744532585}>, <Engineering of machine tools and manufacturing systems using cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85044544960}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Modeling cyber-physical systems with semantic agents, {eid: 78649897744}>, <None, {eid: 85084931175}>, <Digital description of products, processes and resources for task-oriented programming of assembly systems, {eid: 84924657050}>, <Using graph-based design languages to enhance the creation of virtual commissioning models, {eid: 85020027557}>, <Individual coffee maker design using graph-based design languages, {eid: 85050399594}>, <Manuservice ontology: A product data model for service-oriented business interactions in a cloud manufacturing environment, {eid: 84979978043}>, <Challenges in skillbased engineering of industrial automation systems, {eid: 85057257336}>, <Modularization of skill ontologies for industrial robots, {eid: 84983761017}>, <None, {eid: 85065433673}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-11-20,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85084931746

One such portion of the product lifecycle often overlooked when allocating resources for digital thread implementation is the logistics and sustainment phase, which in many cases can account for the majority of the total program cost over the lifespan of the product. This paper in particular examines, as a case study, an opportunity for program sustainment to benefit directly from the digital thread by focusing on modeling subsystem block diagrams in SysML, and using those models to assess, verify, and ultimately generate deliverables assessing the Built-In-Test (BIT) capability of a given system. This information in the form of system models or paper deliverables can greatly expedite routine maintenance procedures for example by allowing technicians to quickly locate faulty cable harnesses in the field, or by enabling reliability engineers to verifiably and instantly ensure that BIT faults have complete coverage over all possible failures, including new ones resulting from costly lessons learned in operational usage. The goal of this effort is to outline a specific concept under which BIT behaviors may be modeled in SysML and how they relate to already established subsystem models, but the broader idea of the paper is to present an argument for the very tangible benefits of investing in and establishing a digital thread not just in the design phase of a program, but also across typical company silos and into the product support and sustainment organizations as well.",,,,,,,,,"<Harrier Failure Survival, Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) Unit, {eid: 85137581796}>, <Testequipmentdepot.com, {eid: 85137592400}>, <None, {eid: 85137599484}>, <None, {eid: 85137561488}>, <None, {eid: 85137547414}>, <None, {eid: 85137585764}>, <None, {eid: 85137589731}>, <Bridging the Gap between Fault Trees and UML State Machine Diagrams for Safety Analysis, {eid: 79951765295, doi: 10.1109/apsec.2010.31}>, <None, {eid: 85137553419}>, <A formal method approach to analyze the design of aircraft Flight Control Systems, {eid: 67650112535, doi: 10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815773}>, <Experimental Evaluation of PICAS: An Electro-Optical Array for Non-Cooperative Collision Sensing on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, {eid: 85088771981, doi: 10.2514/6.2017-0907}>, <None, {eid: 85137566034}>, <Autonomous Guidance and Flight Control on a Partial-Authority Black Hawk Helicopter, {eid: 85092651196}>, <Electrical Cable Design for Urban Air Mobility, {eid: 85091778352, doi: 10.2514/6.2020-0014}>, <Maintenance Considerations for Electric Aircraft and Feedback from Aircraft Maintenance Technicians, {eid: 85051623420, doi: 10.2514/6.2018-3053}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2022-03-05,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85137582748

The methods allow maintainers of systems and hardware to reduce financial and time costs of upkeep. As these methods are adopted for more serious and potentially life-threatening applications, the human operators need trust the predictive system. This attracts the field of Explainable AI (XAI) to introduce explainability and interpretability into the predictive system. XAI brings methods to the field of predictive maintenance that can amplify trust in the users while maintaining well-performing systems. This survey on explainable predictive maintenance (XPM) discusses and presents the current methods of XAI as applied to predictive maintenance while following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. We categorize the different XPM methods into groups that follow the XAI literature. Additionally, we include current challenges and a discussion on future research directions in XPM.","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), industry 4.0, industry 5.0, interpretable machine

"Siriweera A. (AUID: 57222406198), Naruse K. (AUID: 35580022600)",Survey on Cloud Robotics Architecture and Model-Driven Reference Architecture for Decentralized Multicloud Heterogeneous-Robotics Platform,2021,IEEE Access,14,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064192,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064192,"<School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of Aizu>",,"© 2013 IEEE.Robotics engineering is gradually becoming an essential part of our daily life. However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.","Cloud robotics, Industry 40, model-driven, reference

The reason for this success can be found in many aspects: the high maneuverability of the UAVs, the capability of performing autonomous data acquisition, flying at different heights, and the possibility to reach almost any vantage point. The selection of appropriate viewpoints and planning the optimum trajectories of UAVs is an emerging topic that aims at increasing the automation, efficiency, and reliability of the data capturing process to achieve a dataset with desired quality. On the other hand, 3-D reconstruction using the data captured by UAVs is also attracting attention in research and industry. This article investigates a wide range of model-free and model-based algorithms for viewpoints and path planning for 3-D reconstruction of large-scale objects. It presents a bibliography of more than 200 references to cover different aspects of the topic. The analyzed approaches are limited to those that employ a single-UAV as a data capturing platform for outdoor 3-D reconstruction purposes. In addition to discussing the evaluation strategies, this article also highlights the innovations and limitations of the investigated approaches. It concludes with a critical analysis of the existing challenges and future research perspectives.","3-D displays, Aircraft navigation path planning, autonomous aerial vehicles, image reconstruction, motion planning, remotely guided vehicles, surface reconstruction, viewpoints planning",,,,,,,,"<View path planning via online multiview stereo for 3-D modeling of large-scale structures, {eid: 85117460504}>, <Aerial path planning for online real-time exploration and offline high-quality reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes, {eid: 85119321231, doi: 10.1145/3478513.3480491}>, <A compilation of UAV applications for precision agriculture, {eid: 85080064170, doi: 10.1016/J.COMNET.2020.107148}>, <Forestry applications of UAVs in Europe: A review, {eid: 84994297077, doi: 10.1080/01431161.2016.1252477}>, <Meta-analysis of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for agro-environmental monitoring using machine learning and statistical models, {eid: 85094647996, doi: 10.3390/RS12213511}>, <Drone-based container crane inspection: Concept, challenges and preliminary results, {eid: 85119662313, doi: 10.5194/IS-PRS-ANNALS-V-1-2021-121-2021}>, <Drone-enabled bridge inspection methodology and application, {eid: 85049101637, doi: 10.1016/J.AUTCON.2018.06.006}>, <Spiral trajectories for building inspection with quadrotors, {eid: 85136155128, doi: 10.1109/ICUAS54217.2022.9836133}>, <Viewpoint placement for inspection planning, {eid: 85118335227, doi: 10.1007/S00138-021-01252-Z/TABLES/7}>, <Review of unmanned aerial system (UAS) applications in the built environment: Towards automated building inspection procedures using drones, {eid: 85047258837, doi: 10.1016/J.AUTCON.2018.05.002}>, <Unmanned aerial vehicles (Uavs) for physical progress monitoring of construction, {eid: 85108113964, doi: 10.3390/S21124227}>, <BrIM and UAS for bridge inspections and management, {eid: 85076888281, doi: 10.1108/ECAM-12-2018-0556/FULL/XML}>, <Applications of multirotor drone technologies in construction management, {eid: 85045126254, doi: 10.1080/15623599.2018.1452101}>, <Window detection from UAS-derived photogrammetric point cloud employing density-based filtering and perceptual organization, {eid: 85069804293, doi: 10.3390/RS10081320}>, <Rail track detection and projection-based 3D modeling from UAV point cloud, {eid: 85090756260, doi: 10.3390/s20185220}>, <Optimization of photogrammetric flights with UAVs for the metric virtualization of archaeological sites.

(AUID: 57207913658)",Accelerated Safety Testing for Highly Automated Vehicles: Application and Capability Comparison of Surrogate Models,2024,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles,2,10.1109/TIV.2023.3319158,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2023.3319158,"<Tongji University, Department of Traffic Engineering, Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering, Ministry of Education>",,"© 2016 IEEE.With the gradual perfection of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs), it is obligatory to assess their safety performance in simulation that mirrors the real-world driving environment. However, the minimal likelihood of exposure to risky events can result in an extremely time-consuming testing process. To address this issue, we applied a surrogate-based method to expedite scenario-based simulated safety testing for HAVs. Model-based surrogates can quickly approximate the results of untested scenarios, thereby facilitating the search for risky scenarios. Car-following and Cut-in scenarios were chosen as two representative Operational Design Domains (ODDs) with different dimensions for case study. Thus, the capabilities of various Surrogate Models (SMs) can be examined in depth. Utilizing the HighD data, two testing ODDs were constructed to be consistent with naturalistic distribution. We demonstrated that the performances of six mainstream SMs differ significantly as the frequency of risky scenarios decreases. Additionally, we conducted multiple rounds of tests to compare the stability of SMs. We also presented a proposal on SMs selection according to the complexity of ODDs and the rarity of risky scenarios. Compared with random testing, the surrogate-based method can search for 4 times as many high-risk Car-following scenarios with only 4% of the test resources, showing great potential in accelerating the testing process. Notably, when the targeted scenarios are not rare in high-dimensional ODD, the calculation simplicity of SMs is the most important factor. Even random testing can be a viable option in such circumstances.","Highly automated vehicles, safety testing, surrogate models, test efficiency",,,,,,,,"<Automation interrupted: How autonomous

In order to improve the education of human anatomy, the history has brought different teaching methods and approaches using the best available techniques and technologies at a given time. Some of these approaches were considered to be the crucial ones and remain almost unchanged for hundreds of years, while others were designed as valuable complementary resources to face-to-face lectures and lessons allowing learners to study and to understand details of particular anatomical structures and systems through various more or less illustrative ways. Despite the fact that the anatomy has been taught for centuries, there is still no clear consensus of what is the best teaching method to deliver anatomical knowledge and the discussions among professionals continue also in today's modern information technology based era all around the world. Our experienced anatomists suggest the cadaver-based instructions are invaluable part in medical education and should be used in combination with traditional lectures and model based practical lessons for deep understanding of anatomy that is necessary for subsequent safe medical practice. To reach this goal, we developed our own repository of video records with cadaveric dissections and used it in teaching of human anatomy in general and dental medicine students. Comparing the study results the learners obtained, it was observed this approach had a significantly positive effect on their study results. On the other hand, we conducted a survey among learners to verify how this approach affected the process of learning and their in-depth understanding of particular anatomical structures.","Anatomy, dissection, education, multimedia, online repository",,,,,,,,"<What impact does anatomy education have on clinical practice, {eid: 78650268734}>, <Musculoskeletal anatomy education: Evaluating the influence of different teaching and learning activities on medical students perception and academic performance, {eid: 85048301956}>, <A cadaveric procedural anatomy course enhances operative competence, {eid: 84958247178}>, <An overview of the technologies used for anatomy education in terms of medical history, {eid: 85024873630}>, <Papercraft temporal bone in the first step of anatomy education, {eid: 84996866141}>, <Multidimensional approach to teaching anatomy-Do gender and learning style matter, {eid: 84961904668}>, <Anatomy learning from prosected cadaveric specimens versus three-dimensional software: A comparative study of upper limbanatomy, {eid: 85046439122}>, <Best teaching practices in anatomy education: A critical review, {eid: 84962222096}>, <Medical students perspective on training in anatomy, {eid: 85046028311}>, <3D-Printed specimens as a valuable tool in anatomy education: A pilot study, {eid: 85048725842}>, <A survey of virtual human anatomy education systems, {eid: 85041407865}>, <Software simulation of CT reconstructions and artifacts, {eid: 84964030280}>, <Introduction of ultrasound into gross anatomy curriculum: Perceptions of medical students, {eid: 84870459435}>, <Experiential learning, spatial visualization and metacognition: An exercise with the blank page, {eid: 85110514412}>, <Automatization of contact pressure measurement between trunk orthosis and patients body using a matrix tactile sensor, {eid: 84937846770}>, <3D Virtual projection and utilization of its outputs in education of human anatomy, {eid: 84923262495}>, <Multimedia support of medical education utilizing on-line archive of video lectures, {eid: 84934343079}>, <Web based interactive learning programs for dentistry concept and its evaluation, {eid: 84906318184}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-06-25,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85072542463

In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.","Additional Key Words and

This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.","Anomaly Detection Model, Digital Twin, Hierarchical Federated Learning, Vehicular Internet of Things",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85166317422}>, <Intelligent behaviorbased malware detection system on cloud computing environment, {eid: 85109771779}>, <A hierarchical blockchain-enabled federated learning algorithm for knowledge sharing in internet of vehicles, {eid: 85110846016}>, <Federated learning for vehicular internet of things: Recent advances and open issues, {eid: 85102981861}>, <Game Theory Based Privacy Preserving Approach for Collaborative Deep Learning in IoT, {eid: 85127876485}>, <Access control model for google cloud iot, {eid: 85087905802}>, <Future smart connected communities to fight covid-19 outbreak, {eid: 85098730895}>, <Detecting anomalous user behavior in remote patient monitoring, {eid: 85123458530}>, <Learners dilemma: IoT devices training strategies in collaborative deep learning, {eid: 85087905852}>, <Hierarchical federated learning based anomaly detection using digital twins for smart healthcare, {eid: 85126846031}>, <Survey on the internet of vehicles: Network architectures and applications, {eid: 85084914343}>, <Energy-Aware, Device-to-Device Assisted Federated Learning in Edge Computing, {eid: 85160272153}>, <Blockchain empowered asynchronous federated learning for secure data sharing in internet of vehicles, {eid: 85083863289}>, <Secure and Efficient Privacypreserving Authentication Scheme using Cuckoo Filter in Remote Patient Monitoring Network, {eid: 85150678614}>, <An efficient RSU authentication scheme based on Merkle Hash Tree for VANETs, {eid: 85089416580}>, <A scalable and distributed architecture for secure and privacy-preserving authentication and message dissemination in VANETs, {eid: 85114838553}>, <CREASE: Certificateless and REused-pseudonym based Authentication Scheme for Enabling security and privacy in VANETs, {eid: 85136593107}>, <Federated-learning-based anomaly detection for iot security attacks, {eid: 85105874470}>, <A Comprehensive Systematic Literature Review on Intrusion Detection Systems, {eid: 85120032131}>, <Personalized federated learning framework for network traffic anomaly detection, {eid: 85127214441}>, <Federated learning with blockchain for autonomous vehicles: Analysis and design challenges, {eid: 85090226055}>, <Chapter Eight-Edge platforms, frameworks and applications, {eid: 85126838477}>, <Designing A Secure Vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) using Blockchain: A Review, {eid: 85130031196}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <A survey on digital twins: Architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy, and future prospects, {eid: 85153393414}>, <An overview of internet of vehicles, {eid: 84914158074}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2023-08-06,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85174243244

Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.","anomaly detection, cyber-physical system, digital twin, discrepancy monitoring",,,,,,,,"<Model-free fault detection and isolation in large-scale cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85026427850}>, <A digital twin framework for performance monitoring and anomaly detection in fused deposition modeling, {eid: 85072966793}>, <None, {eid: 85104193231}>, <Revision of the Tennessee eastman process model, {eid: 84992494206}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <Model-based diagnosis for cyber-physical production systems based on machine learning and residual-based diagnosis models, {eid: 85074197869}>, <On-line multivariate statistical monitoring of batch processes using Gaussian mixture model, {eid: 77649189520}>, <QUILT: Quality inference from living digital twins in iot-enabled manufacturing systems, {eid: 85066035816}>, <Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the em algorithm, {eid: 0002629270}>, <Fault detection for robot manipulators with parametric uncertainty: A predictionerror-based approach, {eid: 0034471007}>, <A plant-wide industrial process control problem, {eid: 0027561446}>, <Sensor fault tolerant control using sliding mode observers, {eid: 33645126816}>, <Model evolution by run-time parameter adaptation, {eid: 77949405114}>, <Secure estimation and control for cyber-physical systems under adversarial attacks, {eid: 84901474949}>, <None, {eid: 85077991936}>, <Sensor fault classification based on support vector machine and statistical time-domain features, {eid: 85028762179}>, <Anomaly detection in gas turbine time series by means of Bayesian hierarchical models, {eid: 85090220654}>, <Digital twin-enabled anomaly detection for built asset monitoring in operation and maintenance, {eid: 85085247924}>, <None, {eid: 85104202344}>, <A simple and fast algorithm for kmedoids clustering, {eid: 56349158295}>, <None, {eid: 0001217510}>, <Bridging data-driven and model-based approaches for process fault diagnosis and health monitoring: A review of researches and future challenges, {eid: 84995684970}>, <Sabotage attack detection for additive manufacturing systems, {eid: 85081104804}>, <Fleet monitoring and diagnostics framework based on digital twin of aero-engines, {eid: 85053863979}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2021-05-19,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85104176010

Digital twins provide a framework to exploit these data for solving various issues. For many companies in the industrial sector, machine maintenance is a significant issue. Maintenance is essential for high overall equipment efficiency, but it can also be costly. Therefore, it should only be performed when necessary, based on the machine's condition. Condition monitoring is used to assess a machine's condition periodically, allowing for condition-based maintenance. In this paper, a simulation-based approach for parameter estimation is presented that contributes to condition-based maintenance.

By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.","autonomy, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, socio-technical systems design, subject-orientation",,,,,,,,"<Privacy-preserving identifiers for iot: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85102783212}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <Cyber-physical systems: Extending pervasive sensing from control theory to the internet of things, {eid: 85021623562}>, <None, {eid: 4243270783}>, <Digital twin\-The simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Holen wir uns das Web zurück, {eid: 85084531132}>, <Fast keyedverification anonymous credentials on standard smart cards, {eid: 85068203132}>, <Scalable revocation scheme for anonymous credentials based on n-times unlinkable proofs, {eid: 84998655074}>, <Classification of cyber-physical production systems applications: Proposition of an analysis framework, {eid: 85054842368}>, <Cyber-physical system design contracts, {eid: 84883096881}>, <A methodology to compare anonymization methods regarding their risk-utility trade-off, {eid: 85030157962}>, <Subject-oriented modeling and execution of multi-agent business processes, {eid: 84893310152}>, <None, {eid: 84976613094}>, <None, {eid: 84955346695}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Determining the optimal level of autonomy in cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85012880256}>, <Design, modelling, simulation and integration of cyber physical systems: Methods and applications, {eid: 84992337524}>, <Specifying autonomy in the internet of things: The autonomy model and notation, {eid: 85057304297}>, <Towards agent-based smart factories: A subject-oriented modeling approach, {eid: 84893250385}>, <Design techniques and applications of cyberphysical systems: A survey, {eid: 85028199291}>, <The future of home health care: A strategic framework for optimizing value, {eid: 84990178239}>, <The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models, {eid: 84928667408}>, <Web-based digital twin modeling and remote control of cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85079532714}>, <Digital twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Proposal of a user-centred approach for cps design: Pillbox case study, {eid: 85061301270}>, <Using s-bpm for plc code generation and extension of subject-oriented methodology to all layers of modern control systems, {eid: 84859359787}>, <None, {eid: 85107443510}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Towards a digital twin for manufacturing processes: Applicability on laser welding, {eid: 85089063716}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770}>, <IoT-Based digital twin for energy cyber-physical systems: Design and implementation, {eid: 85092237155}>, <A conceptual framework for industry 4.0, {eid: 85151510500}>, <Improvement of factory planning by automated generation of a digital twin, {eid: 85092759053}>, <System-of-systems support - A bigraph approach to interoperability and emergent behavior, {eid: 84961313278}>, <Enabling emergent behavior in systems-of-systems through bigraph-based modeling, {eid: 84941107437}>, <Challenges and potentials of digital twins and industry 4.0 in product design and production for high performance products, {eid: 85076743814}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2021-04-28,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85107451923

Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.","Behaviour trees (BTs), Digital twins (DTs), Fault trees (FTs), Ground systems operations, MBSA, MBSE, Model-based diagnosis (MBD), Model-based operations (MBO), Operational diagnosis",,,,,,,,"<Subsea Risk and Reliability, {eid: 85099274669}>, <Overview of fault diagnosis methods based on Petri net models, {eid: 84911485987}>, <Model Based Systems Engineering on the Europa mission concept study, {eid: 84861140796}>, <A comparison among tools for the diagnosability of discrete event systems, {eid: 84872541301}>, <2022 Towards an agile, model-based multidisciplinary process to improve operational diagnosis in complex systems, {eid: 85142925799}>, <None, {eid: 85049606923}>, <Pytrees Development Community, {eid: 85142925025}>, <2017 Emergence of digital twins, {eid: 85142935766}>, <2019 Model-based fault diagnosis and prognosis of dynamic systems: A review, {eid: 85067299672}>, <None, {eid: 85142921970}>, <Fault diagnosis and identification of discrete event systems using Petri nets, {eid: 53149139303}>, <Inheriting Curiosity: Leveraging MBSE to Build Mars2020, {eid: 84960329424}>, <Fault diagnosis in discrete-event systems: Framework and model reduction, {eid: 0032258412}>, <Fault Tree Analysis, {eid: 85083963451}>, <Toward an Experiential Design Language: Augmenting Modelbased Systems Engineering with Technical Storytelling in Virtual Worlds, {eid: 84897978831}>, <2018 Model-based systems engineering: Motivation, current status, and research opportunities, {eid: 85046694426}>, <2021 Digital Twin models in industrial operations: State-of-The-Art and future research directions, {eid: 85104100632}>, <Structured fault-detection and diagnosis using finite-state automaton, {eid: 0032317840}>, <Experimentable digital twins for model-based systems engineering and simulation-based development, {eid: 85021452617}>, <2020 Plant Model-Based Fault Detection during Aircraft Takeoff Using Non-Deterministic Finite-State Automata, {eid: 85089848595}>, <Fault Diagnosis for Timed Automata, {eid: 84974696065}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-10-23,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85142931868

This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.","Activity modeling, Agent-based modeling, Business process modeling, Cyber-physical production systems, Digital twin, Multi-paradigm modeling",,,,,,,,"<The megam@rt2 ecsel project: Megamodelling at runtime-scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems, {eid: 85048178927}>, <Towards formal analysis of multi-paradigm model transformations, {eid: 77953732475}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <None, {eid: 84889374036}>, <Modeldriven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <An asm semantics for uml activity diagrams, {eid: 84974691388}>, <Model-driven engineering for design-runtime interaction in complex systems: Scientific challenges and roadmap, {eid: 85058512584}>, <Scalable model views over heterogeneous modeling technologies and resources, {eid: 85083396373}>, <Translating bpmn models into uml activities, {eid: 67649970894}>, <Blended modelling-what, why and how, {eid: 85075926513}>, <Recommendation patterns for business process imperative modeling, {eid: 85020898336}>, <Linking data and bpmn processes to achieve executable models, {eid: 85021236150}>, <Towards a mapping from bpmn to agents, {eid: 38149060099}>, <BPMN vs UML activity diagram for business process modeling, {eid: 84916605979}>, <None, {eid: 85096804518}>, <Microservices as agents in iot systems, {eid: 85020401655}>, <Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Web-based digital twin modeling and remote control of cyber-physical production systems, {eid: 85079532714}>, <XMOF: Executable dsmls based on fuml, {eid: 84891321889}>, <Behavior-based control of multi-robot assembly/palletizing systems, {eid: 78650234125}>, <Guest editorial: Special issue on computer automated multi-paradigm modeling, {eid: 84988926909}>, <Computer automated multi-paradigm modeling: An introduction, {eid: 11844295391}>, <Flexible simulation (FlexSim) software: FlexSim simulation environment, {eid: 81055146443}>, <None, {eid: 85096766284}>, <None, {eid: 85096809895}>, <Multi-paradigm modeling for design and operation of intelligent cyber-physical systems (keynote talk), {eid: 85096766359}>, <Heuristics for robots-humans tasks assignment in a containers loading center, {eid: 85075864039}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <None, {eid: 0004285157}>, <Modeling languages in Industry 4.0: An extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85074431675}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-16,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85096756100

Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots.","cyber-physical systems, digital twin, model-driven engineering, multi-paradigm modeling",,,,,,,,"<2019.

They are virtual reflections of physical world entities, of objects and phenomena, and are rapidly becoming an asset for innovation. There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs' potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.","Artificial intelligence, Data, Datafication, Digital model, Digital shadow, Digital twin, Intelligent technologies, Machine learning",,,,,,,,"<Leaders wanted: Experts at change at a moment of truth.

In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.","Digital twin, GIS, Ground liquefaction, Ground resistance, Three - dimensional ground resistance modeling",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85059946493}>, <Examination of applicability of liquefaction potential index to seismic vulnerability evaluation of the Korean river levees, {eid: 85059946926}>, <None, {eid: 85059963187}>, <An analysis of vertical position accuracy for the three-dimensional spatial data object utilizing the public information, {eid: 84979628076}>, <None, {eid: 85059946872}>, <None, {eid: 85059934084}>, <LPI-based Assessment of Liquefaction Potential on the West Coastal Region of Korea, {eid: 85059963317}>, <Flood Risk Mapping using 3D Virtual Reality Based on Geo-Spatial Information, {eid: 85059965476}>, <Assessment of liquefaction potential using correlation between shear wave velocity and normalized LPI on urban areas of Seoul and Gyeongju, {eid: 85059958211}>, <None, {eid: 85059946493}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2018-09-21,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85059946723

Moreover, it was found that security is not a top priority, but is often mentioned as a challenge. Besides the lack of standardization, the amount of academic papers published and industrial solutions offered is increasing, showing that the consensus is not a limiting factor and the concept is gaining popularity over the years and being applied in an increasing number of sectors, mainly on manufacturing, energy, aerospace and automotive.","architecture, digital twin, framework, security",,,,,,,,"<Digital Twins bonds society with cyber-physical Energy Systems: A literature review, {eid: 85127452658}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <None, {eid: 85169689136}>, <None, {eid: 0003867065}>, <Digital Twin: Enabling Technologies, Challenges and Open Research, {eid: 85087331367}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 85169694605}>, <None, {eid: 85169699185}>, <None, {eid: 85169685014}>, <None, {eid: 85169676874}>, <None, {eid: 85169687148}>, <What is the different between model, architecture, framework, and protocol in computer science, {eid: 85169699199}>, <None, {eid: 85032274754}>, <Characterising the Digital Twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Reference Framework for Digital Twins within Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <Industrial Network Security: Securing critical infrastructure networks for smart grid, SCADA, and other Industrial Control Systems, {eid: 84962298310}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital Twin: Finding Common Ground-A Meta-Review, {eid: 85121621632}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875}>, <Digital Twin for Verification and Validation of Industrial Automation Systems-a Survey, {eid: 85093362017}>, <Digital Twin Models in Industrial Operations: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85084241025}>, <Digital Twins From Smart Manufacturing to Smart Cities: A Survey, {eid: 85117842563}>, <A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-based Production Systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A guide to conducting a standalone systematic literature review, {eid: 84948736579}>, <Enablers and Barriers to the Implementation of Digital Twins in the Process Industry: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85099750826}>, <Implementation of digital twins in the process industry: A systematic literature review of enablers and barriers, {eid: 85118569393}>, <Towards a Framework for the Classification of Digital Twins and their Applications, {eid: 85119073739}>, <The Role of AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data in Digital Twinning: A Systematic Literature Review, Challenges, and Opportunities, {eid: 85101961329}>, <Security issues in the Internet of Things (IoT): A comprehensive study, {eid: 85046619795}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <The Digital Twin Concept in Industry-A Review and Systematization, {eid: 85093358253}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: Stateof-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Digital Twins: A Maturity Model for Their Classification and Evaluation, {eid: 85133780403}>, <Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85134599958}>, <Digital Twin in Services and Industrial Product Service Systems:: Review and Analysis, {eid: 85070547885}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-08-29,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85169698817

Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture-the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.","cyber-physical system, digital twin, reference framework",,,,,,,,"<Current status and advancement of cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84928606583}>, <Cyber physical systems in the context of industry 4.0, {eid: 84905844055}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <A survey of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84555177840}>, <Reference architecture and maturity levels for cyber-physical systems in the mechanical engineering industry, {eid: 85006380430}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <The role of the industry 4.0 asset administration shell and the digital twin during the life cycle of a plant, {eid: 85044475829}>, <Digital twin-based smart production management and control framework for the complex product assembly shop-floor, {eid: 85041548794}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85061021953}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>, <Procedures for performing systematic reviews, {eid: 27644567603}>, <Qualitative data analysis for applied policy research, {eid: 0001457476}>, <None, {eid: 0037941821}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Equipment energy consumption management in digital twin shop-floor: A framework and potential applications, {eid: 85048222217}>, <Dynamic resource allocation optimization for digital twin-driven smart shopfloor, {eid: 85048229043}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <A digital twin-based multimodal ui adaptation framework for assistance systems in industry 4.0, {eid: 85069873204}>, <Digital twin-proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <The role of data fusion in predictive maintenance using digital twin, {eid: 85046491768}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <Visualising the digital twin using web services and augmented reality, {eid: 85012932205}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-05-28,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85072842816

In the past, object design was more based on the cognitive level of the designers, and the design results could not fully meet the requirements of ""high cohesion and low coupling""design principle, which led to a large amount of modification work when the system faced with the change of requirements, and it was difficult to support the continuous development of the enterprise's digital business. This paper proposes an object design optimization method based on graph theory, which consists of four parts: firstly, the requirements and objects are expressed as requirement diagrams and object diagrams, so that the object design can be abstracted as a transformation from the requirement diagrams to the object diagrams; secondly, quantitative evaluation indexes of cohesion and coupling are given for the object model based on the graph theory to quantify the principle of ""high cohesion, low coupling"", so as to quantify the principle of ""high cohesion, low coupling"". Secondly, based on graph theory, the quantitative evaluation indexes of aggregation and coupling degree of object model are given to quantify the principle of ""high cohesion and low coupling"", so that quantitative comparison can be made between different design solutions to guide the design optimization work; thirdly, the object groups that conform to the characteristics of a specific graph theory can be found in the object relationship graph, and designers can decide whether or not to merge them in order to form the optimized object design; fourthly, based on the requirement graph and industry knowledge, the Digital twin can be constructed heuristically, which can significantly increase the degree of object The fourth is that digital twin objects can be constructed heuristically based on the demand graph and industry knowledge, which can significantly increase the degree of object aggregation and reduce the degree of coupling between objects. The paper illustrates the design algorithm process with a simplified electric power marketing system, and gives a comparison of the design results of the actual digital marketing system.","Digital twin, graph theory, High cohesion and low coupling, power marketing, system design optimization algorithms",,,,,,,,"<Construction of High cohesion and low Coupling Software Architecture J, {eid: 85192819919}>, <Design Method of New Generation Distribution Power System business center J, {eid: 85192820279}>, <None, {eid: 85192825419}>, <None, {eid: 85192823535}>, <None, {eid: 85192827403}>, <Construction and simulation method of universal digital twin for distributed energy resources J, {eid: 85192857577}>, <Novel power system digitization based on Digital twin technologyJ, {eid: 85192823380}>, <None, {eid: 85192853335}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-11-24,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85192850739

Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders.

This research explores the application of AI techniques like neural networks and genetic algorithms for multiphysics modeling, using an aerospace case example for educational purposes. A literature review examines existing physics-based and empirical modeling approaches in this domain. Subsequently, a multiphysics control model incorporating thermal, structural, and fluid dynamics interactions is developed. Neural networks can be trained on simulation data to learn these multiphysics relationships, with the potential to augment robotic assembly. Additionally, genetic algorithms optimize system designs by evolving populations of models based on performance objectives. This enables rapid virtual testing and discovery of optimal configurations. The integrated AI modeling framework builds on a systematic literature review, providing a reference architecture for multiphysics modeling and simulation. Literature findings facilitate developing an optimal methodology for a model example. The research demonstrates advancing complex engineering models via a sample pseudocode algorithm for electronic systems control. Integrative systems engineering research can enhance simulation-driven design. This pseudocode contributes knowledge on AI-driven multiphysics modeling within a scientific framework. The proposed technique has applications in innovating systems-level designs with prudent limitations.","Advanced Engineering Optimizations, AI-driven Multiphysics Modeling.

As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion. From this, Digital Twin (DT), one of the main enabling technologies in Industry 4.0, has been identified to have the great potential in solving these challenges. DT sheds light on the real fusion of the cyber world and the physical world, and it has the potential to be used as a technology to help people build virtulized system with high-fidelity, hence greatly lower bar on the cybersecurity research of the cyber physical system and create other DT based cybersecurity applications.","CPS, cybersecurity, Digital Twin, emulation, ICS, SCADA,

Those connections are essential to the complete system, as they enable external systems to react to changes in the internal model and vice versa. In our case, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability, a case study showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented. We show that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.

In this regard, Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) models have been widely adopted. However, the computing time of the CFD/HT simulation is prohibitively long in practice. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been explored to approximate the CFD/HT simulation by a linear combination of POD modes and coefficients. Existing approaches to calculating the POD coefficients use either the black-box interpolation or the simplified physical model, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability. To advance existing approaches, this paper proposes Reducio, a physics-guided model reduction approach based on the POD to predict the temperature field by following two key phases of i) offline POD modes calculation and coefficients interpolation and ii) online coefficients extrapolation supervised by the principle of energy balance. To extrapolate the coefficients with limited training data, we adopt the Gaussian Process (GP) model to learn a nonlinear map between the boundary conditions and POD coefficients. We conduct two case studies in two data centers with different scales. Evaluation results in the edge data center show that Reducio achieves sub-1°C mean absolute error (MAE) in temperature field prediction compared with the CFD/HT simulation result, outperforming the existing method based on the simplified physical model by 1.5 °C. When evaluating in the industry-grade hyper-scale data center with the sensor measurements, around 1°C temperature prediction MAE is observed. Furthermore, Reducio can predict the full-fledged temperature field in real-time, making it a strong candidate for building data center predictive digital twins.","computational fluid dynamics, data center, digital twin, gaussian process, proper orthogonal decomposition",,,,,,,,"<Comparison of data driven modeling approaches for temperature prediction in data centers, {eid: 85061825154}>, <Toward a Systematic Survey for Carbon Neutral Data Centers, {eid: 85127077398}>, <EnergyPlus: Creating a new-generation building energy simulation program, {eid: 0034825352}>, <CVXPY: A Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization, {eid: 84979920226}>, <Dynamic reduced order thermal modeling of data center air temperatures, {eid: 84860325809}>, <None, {eid: 84944106377}>, <Gdcsim: A tool for analyzing green data center design and resource management techniques, {eid: 80053197084}>, <An open source fast fluid dynamics model for data center thermal management, {eid: 85095916124}>, <OpenFOAM: A C++ library for complex physics simulations, {eid: 80052747234}>, <Computational and experimental validation of a vortex-superposition-based buoyancy approximation for the COMPACT code in data centers, {eid: 84887577445}>, <Thermocast: A cyber-physical forecasting model for datacenters, {eid: 80052661285}>, <Creating a calibrated CFD model of a midsize data center, {eid: 84954040173}>, <Optlayerpractical constrained optimization for deep reinforcement learning in the real world, {eid: 85062258932}>, <CFD modeling of an existing raised-floor data center, {eid: 84880761009}>, <Multi-parameter model reduction in multi-scale convective systems, {eid: 76749093026}>, <Proper orthogonal decomposition for reduced order thermal modeling of air cooled data centers, {eid: 77954771145}>, <Reduced order thermal modeling of data centers via distributed sensor data, {eid: 84857160306}>, <Modeling, simulation, information technology & processing roadmap, {eid: 84885413599}>, <CFD-Based Operational Thermal Efficiency Improvement of a Production Data Center, {eid: 84893960482}>, <Turbulence and the dynamics of coherent structures.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.","digital twin, internet-of-things, machine learning, smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 85023614860}>, <None, {eid: 85052197244}>, <None, {eid: 85050668724}>, <None, {eid: 85066033996}>, <None, {eid: 85050203253}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881426231}>, <The air force digital thread/digital twin-life cycle integration and use of computational and experimental knowledge, {eid: 85007463616}>, <Additive manufacturing impacts on a two-level supply chain, {eid: 85057320676}>, <3d and 4d printing technologies: Innovative process engineering and smart additive manufacturing, {eid: 85071007546}>, <A digital twin for rapid qualification of 3d printed metallic components, {eid: 85056629776}>, <Concept development of a sensor array for 3d printer, {eid: 84986247624}>, <From surveillance to digital twin: Challenges and recent advances of signal processing for industrial internet of things, {eid: 85053235550}>, <IoT standardization and implementation challenges, {eid: 85026268994}>, <The iiot/iot device control model based on narrow-band IoT (nb-iot), {eid: 85045524865}>, <My smartphone knows what you print: Exploring smartphone-based side-channel attacks against 3D Printers, {eid: 84995475547}>, <Leave your phone at the door: Side channels that reveal factory floor secrets, {eid: 85066019857}>, <Building blocks for a digital twin of additive manufacturing, {eid: 85021415524}>, <Building digital twins of 3D printing machines, {eid: 85008410735}>, <Digital twin-the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <C2PS: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <On the effects of modeling as-manufactured geometry: Toward digital twin, {eid: 84908334477}>, <None, {eid: 85059973348}>, <Surface quality prediction in fdm additive manufacturing, {eid: 85025614222}>, <Integration of fdm surface quality modeling with process design, {eid: 84977561144}>, <Acoustic emission for in situ quality monitoring in additive manufacturing using spectral convolutional neural networks, {eid: 85046013504}>, <In situ and real-time monitoring of powderbed am by combining acoustic emission and artificial intelligence, {eid: 85055495130}>, <Online real-time quality monitoring in additive manufacturing processes using heterogeneous sensors, {eid: 84941208014}>, <Functional quantitative and qualitative models for quality modeling in a fused deposition modeling process, {eid: 85034225252}>, <An online sparse estimation-based classification approach for real-time monitoring in advanced manufacturing processes from heterogeneous sensor data, {eid: 84961962758}>, <None, {eid: 85066046591}>, <Acoustic side-channel attacks on additive manufacturing systems, {eid: 85043535809}>, <Oligo-snoop: A non-invasive side channel attack against DNA synthesis machines, {eid: 85114919587}>, <Key performance indicators for manufacturing operations management in the process industry, {eid: 85045255381}>, <None, {eid: 85029386337}>, <Cross-validation, {eid: 79954553074}>, <A working guide to boosted regression trees, {eid: 44849118698}>, <Kcad: Kinetic cyber-attack detection method for cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems, {eid: 85000981895}>, <None, {eid: 85066011982}>, <None, {eid: 85066043227}>, <None, {eid: 85066014124}>, <In situ monitoring of fdm machine condition via acoustic emission, {eid: 84941702635}>, <Accuracy prediction in fused deposition modeling, {eid: 84905084057}>, <Real-time fdm machine condition monitoring and diagnosis based on acoustic emission and hidden semi-markov model, {eid: 84990985644}>, <A phm approach to additive manufacturing equipment health monitoring, fault diagnosis, and quality control, {eid: 84920540827}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2019-04-15,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85066035816

As an instructive example, we look into smart semiconductor processes with focus on photolithography. To this end, we formulate a static optimization problem to maximize the damage of a cyber-attack against a photolithography digital twin that minimizes detectability to the process controller.

The dominant view developed in the literature so far is about the virtualisation of individual physical assets in a closed-system perspective. In this article, we introduce and explore a broader perspective that we call Web of Digital Twins (WoDT), in which the digital twin paradigm is exploited for the pervasive softwarisation of possibly large-scale interrelated physical realities. A WoDT can be conceived as an open, distributed and dynamic ecosystem of connected digital twins, functioning as an interoperable service-oriented layer for applications running on top, especially smart applications and multiagent systems. The article introduces an abstract model and architecture aimed to capture key aspects of the idea not bound to any specific application domains or implementing technologies and discusses their adoption in engineering real-world systems. To this purpose, two concrete case studies are considered, in the context of healthcare and smart mobility. Finally, the article includes a discussion of a selected set of research directions.","agents, Digital twins, MAS, web, WoDT",,,,,,,,"<COGNITWIN-Hybrid and cognitive digital twins for the process industry, {eid: 85091994848}>, <Abductive design of BDI agent-based digital twins of organizations, {eid: 85102731433}>, <Application-driven network-aware digital twin management in industrial edge environments, {eid: 85103239228, doi: 10.1109/TII.2021.3067447}>, <JADE-A java agent development framework, {eid: 37249026890}>, <The first twenty years of agent-based software development with JADE, {eid: 85084482194}>, <Multi-agent oriented programming with JaCaMo, {eid: 84875735836}>, <Digital twin-the simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <A decade in hindsight: The missing bridge between multi-agent systems and the world wide web, {eid: 85076162268}>, <On the integration of agents and digital twins in healthcare, {eid: 85088988374}>, <BDI personal medical assistant agents: The case of trauma tracking and alerting, {eid: 85058662276}>, <Towards practical reasoning agents for the semantic web, {eid: 1142268247}>, <A multiagent approach to autonomous intersection management, {eid: 44449142496}>, <Enhancing cognition for digital twins, {eid: 85093073572}>, <None, {eid: 85140653646}>, <None, {eid: 0004197808}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US air force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Knowledge graphs, {eid: 85101524472}>, <Knowledge graphs, {eid: 85108965182}>, <An agent-based approach for building complex software systems, {eid: 0003062036}>, <Tutorial: Distributed knowledge graphs for the web of things, {eid: 85151509610}>, <Digital twin for adaptation of robots behavior in flexible robotic assembly lines, {eid: 85071655549}>, <Digital twin based synchronised control and simulation of the industrial robotic cell using virtual reality, {eid: 85064769107}>, <A novel cloud-based framework for the elderly healthcare services using digital twin, {eid: 85065103886}>, <Architectural aspects of digital twins in IIoT systems, {eid: 85062630045}>, <Coordination of autonomous vehicles: Taxonomy and survey, {eid: 85105377292}>, <None, {eid: 85150269189}>, <Digital twin in the IoT context: A survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models, {eid: 85087488936}>, <Real-time tracking and documentation in trauma management, {eid: 85061744374}>, <Agent-Oriented programming with underlying ontological reasoning, {eid: 33745766222}>, <Large-Scale semantic integration of linked data: A survey, {eid: 85072373568}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <The knowledge level, {eid: 49049136479}>, <Artifacts in the A&A meta-model for multi-agent systems, {eid: 52949149709}>, <Coordinating with the future: The anticipatory nature of representation, {eid: 44349151557}>, <WIP: preliminary evaluation of digital twins on MEC software architecture, {eid: 85112417906}>, <Querying distributed RDF data sources with SPARQL, {eid: 45449100722}>, <Modeling rational agents within a BDI-Architecture, {eid: 0002572155}>, <Pervasive and connected digital twins-A vision for digital health, {eid: 85099732635, doi: 10.1109/MIC.2021.3052039}>, <The mirror world: Preparing for mixed-reality living, {eid: 84928644612}>, <Feeding the digital twin: Basics, models and lessons learned from building an IoT analytics toolbox (Invited Talk), {eid: 85062634850}>, <Towards actionable cognitive digital twins for manufacturing, {eid: 85086444510}>, <Digital twins: Bridging physical space and cyberspace, {eid: 85075743259}>, <City digital twin potentials: A review and research agenda, {eid: 85103506867}>, <A digital twin method for automated behavior analysis of large-scale distributed IoT systems, {eid: 85069795719}>, <IEEE 1451 smart sensor digital twin federation for IoT/CPS research, {eid: 85065922537}>, <A digital twin architecture based on the industrial internet of things technologies, {eid: 85063782240}>, <Digital twin generation: Re-Conceptualizing agent systems for behavior-centered cyberphysical system development, {eid: 85100473353}>, <Internet of things ontology for digital twin in cyber physical systems, {eid: 85065093309}>, <Make more digital twins, {eid: 85072672277}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for Industry 4. 0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <Environment as a first-class abstraction in multi-agent systems, {eid: 35148899434}>, <Intelligent agents: Theory and practice, {eid: 84972263711}>, <A digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning, {eid: 85062237403}>, <Concepts of Digital Twin Network, {eid: 85111444956}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2022-11-14,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85132159083

It requires the creation of system monitors, instrumentation for data collection, and the definition of constraints. All of these aspects need to evolve to accommodate changes in the system. However, most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors and constraints for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for evolving the monitoring infrastructure. Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS. In this 'new and emerging results' paper we propose a novel framework for model-integrated runtime monitoring. We combine model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate large parts of the monitoring framework and to reduce the maintenance effort necessary when parts of the monitored system change. We build a prototype and evaluate our approach against a system for controlling the flights of unmanned aerial vehicles.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Evolution, Model-Driven Engineering, Runtime Monitoring",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 3142731744}>, <The next generation of human-drone partnerships: Co-designing an emergency response system, {eid: 85086454234}>, <Model-driven requirements for humans-on-the-loop multi-uav missions, {eid: 85097308620}>, <Misuse cases: Use cases with hostile intent, {eid: 0037240812}>, <Fuzzy goals for requirementsdriven adaptation, {eid: 78650408637}>, <Models@run time: A guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955}>, <None, {eid: 85008066028}>, <Model-Driven software engineering in practice, second edition, {eid: 84880445741}>, <Distributed graph queries for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85045651901}>, <Distributed graph queries over models@ run time for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85074030886}>, <Java-MOP: A monitoring oriented programming environment for Java, {eid: 24644483315}>, <Dronology: An incubator for cyber-physical systems research, {eid: 85049695714}>, <None, {eid: 85115610627}>, <Flexible resource monitoring of Java programs, {eid: 84900816089}>, <Runtime verification for decentralised and distributed systems, {eid: 85042126523}>, <Goal-driven adaptation of servicebased systems from runtime monitoring data, {eid: 80054969989}>, <TemporalEMF: A temporal metamodeling framework, {eid: 85054785176}>, <Autonomous navigation of mobile robots in factory environment, {eid: 85083531436}>, <Creating user-specific business process monitoring dashboards with a model-driven approach, {eid: 85046689792}>, <Model-driven digital twin construction: Synthesizing the integration of cyber-physical systems with their information systems, {eid: 85096992990}>, <Coastal and environmental remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles: An overview, {eid: 84940913617}>, <Complex event processing in distributed systems, {eid: 0013176589}>, <Monitoring distributed systems, {eid: 0002587301}>, <Unmanned air vehicles for coastal and environmental research, {eid: 79953762168}>, <A domain analysis of resource and requirements monitoring: Towards a comprehensive model of the software monitoring domain, {eid: 85063754904}>, <Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): A survey on civil applications and key research challenges, {eid: 85065056485}>, <None, {eid: 85115638720}>, <Misbehaviour prediction for autonomous driving systems, {eid: 85094321490}>, <Varys: An agnostic model-driven monitoring-as-a-service framework for the cloud, {eid: 85071931151}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4, {eid: 85019987476}>, <The model transformation language of the VIATRA2 framework, {eid: 34548501253}>, <Monitoring CPS at runtime-A case study in the UAV domain, {eid: 85056510669}>, <Requirements monitoring frameworks: A systematic review, {eid: 84984972165}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2021-05-25,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85115603171

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.","assurance case, cyber-physical systems, digital twin, goal structuring notation, robot operating system, self-adaptive systems",,,,,,,,"<Adaptation of system confguration under the robot operating system, {eid: 84929833712}>, <A use case in model-based robot development using aadl and ros, {eid: 85051232948}>, <Fuzzy goals for requirements-driven adaptation, {eid: 78650408637}>, <Models@run.time: A guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955}>, <Models@ run, {eid: 85008066028}>, <None, {eid: 85096986414}>, <Mode-based recon-fguration of critical software component architectures, {eid: 70350075812}>, <Self-Adaptive software needs quantitative verifcation at runtime, {eid: 84865658584}>, <Engineering trustworthy self-Adaptive software with dynamic assurance cases, {eid: 85029184307}>, <None, {eid: 84942510696}>, <Rosplan: Planning in the robot operating system, {eid: 84943271321}>, <Using models at runtime to address assurance for self-Adaptive systems, {eid: 84904814843}>, <Software engineering for self-Adaptive systems: A research roadmap, {eid: 70350033987}>, <Architecture-based self-Adaptation in the presence of multiple objectives, {eid: 50249148558}>, <Advocate: An assurance case automation toolset, {eid: 84868135590}>, <Model-driven development of safety architectures, {eid: 85040627941}>, <A formal approach to adaptive software: Continuous assurance of non-functional requirements, {eid: 84861575927}>, <Kld-sampling: Adaptive particle filters, {eid: 3042672538}>, <Autorally: An open platform for aggressive autonomous driving, {eid: 85060544913}>, <None, {eid: 84886643077}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <A model-based approach to software deployment in robotics, {eid: 84893740439}>, <Activforms: Active formal models for self-Adaptation, {eid: 84903737752}>, <None, {eid: 84991042142}>, <Evaluating security assurance case adaptation, {eid: 85071508654}>, <The goal structuring notation-A safety argument notation, {eid: 33745807406}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062}>, <Achieving self-management via utility functions, {eid: 33847356880}>, <Design and use paradigms for gazebo, an open-source multi-robot simulator, {eid: 14044257268}>, <Cyber-physical systems and digital twins in the industrial internet of things cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85061050520}>, <The evolving philosophers problem: Dynamic change management, {eid: 0025521832}>, <Safety cases: A review of challenges, {eid: 84886648028}>, <Measure confdence of assurance cases in safety-critical domains, {eid: 85049788231}>, <Two decades of assurance case tools: A survey, {eid: 85053915986}>, <None, {eid: 84907936142}>, <Ros-cbt: Communication benchmarking tool for the robot operating system: Extended abstract, {eid: 85075633362}>, <Proactive self-Adaptation under uncertainty: A probabilistic model checking approach, {eid: 84960425213}>, <Models@ run.time to support dynamic adaptation, {eid: 70350345225}>, <None, {eid: 84947603777}>, <Ros: An open-source robot operating system, {eid: 77957352104}>, <Automatic derivation of utility functions for monitoring software requirements, {eid: 80054069616}>, <The rocs framework to support the development of autonomous robots, {eid: 85096978597}>, <None, {eid: 84955313607}>, <None, {eid: 85053872274}>, <Ros-military: Progress and promise, {eid: 85096970570}>, <Utility functions in autonomic systems, {eid: 4544366889}>, <A survey of formal methods in self-Adaptive systems, {eid: 84866043696}>, <Unifying reference model for formal specifcation of distributed self-Adaptive systems, {eid: 84862088448}>, <Relax: Incorporating uncertainty into the specifcation of self-Adaptive systems, {eid: 73549119249}>, <Model-based development of dynamically adaptive software, {eid: 34247136847}>, <Modular verifcation of dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 70450255476}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-18,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85096963714

Existing service robots, while operational, often struggle with adaptability and dynamic task management, leading to inefficiencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CrowdBot, a robot management system that enhances service in campus environments. Our system leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning-based cloud-edge hybrid scheduling framework (REDIS), for efficient online streaming task assignment and dynamic action scheduling. To verify the REDIS framework, we have developed a digital twin simulation platform, which integrates large language models and hot-swapping technology. This facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, efficient task allocation, and cost-effective execution through the reuse of robot equipment. Our comprehensive simulations corroborate the system's remarkable efficacy, demonstrating significant improvements with a 24.46% reduction in task completion times, a 9.37% decrease in travel distances, and up to a 3% savings in power usage. Additionally, the system achieves a 7.95% increase in the number of tasks completed and a 9.49% reduction in response time. Real-world case studies further affirm CrowdBot's capability to adeptly execute tasks and judiciously recycle resources, thereby offering a smart and viable solution for the streamlined management of campus services.","crowdsensing, dynamic task schedule, equipment-swappable robots, online streaming task assignment, reinforcement learning, robot management",,,,,,,,"<The gated community mentality, {eid: 84867136033}>, <What is beyond the edges? gated communities and their role in chinas desire for harmonious cities, {eid: 85092799609}>, <Robots on campus: understanding public perception of robots using social media, {eid: 85095129265}>, <Sircaur: Safe inspection of reinforced concrete structures by autonomous robot, {eid: 85091273231}>, <Interaction between hotel service robots and humans: A hotel-specific service robot acceptance model (sram), {eid: 85092740275}>, <Software crowdsourcing task allocation algorithm based on dynamic utility, {eid: 85063539582}>, <Fair task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing, {eid: 85104699784}>, <Fairness-aware task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing: Gametheoretic approaches, {eid: 85112864800}>, <An effective iterated greedy algorithm for reliability-oriented task allocation in distributed computing systems, {eid: 84885180572}>, <Task allocation for maximizing reliability of distributed systems: A simulated annealing approach, {eid: 33748083031}>, <None, {eid: 85041194636}>, <Task offloading based on lstm prediction and deep reinforcement learning for efficient edge computing in iot, {eid: 85123194472}>, <Ai chains: Transparent and controllable human-ai interaction by chaining large language model prompts, {eid: 85127254663}>, <Crowdos: A ubiquitous operating system for crowdsourcing and mobile crowd sensing, {eid: 85093921609}>, <Ros: An open-source robot operating system, {eid: 77957352104}>, <None, {eid: 85059202163}>, <A personalized task allocation strategy in mobile crowdsensing for minimizing total cost, {eid: 85127454787}>, <Mobile crowd sensing based dynamic traffic efficiency framework for urban traffic congestion control, {eid: 85115340656}>, <Expertise-aware truth analysis and task allocation in mobile crowdsourcing, {eid: 85100752780}>, <Distributed fuzzy semi-infinite auction based optimization for cooperative robots tasks allocation, {eid: 85128186855}>, <On efficiency in dynamic multi-robot task allocation, {eid: 85101241744}>, <Delay optimization with fcfs queuing model in mobile edge computing-assisted uav swarms: A game-theoretic learning approach, {eid: 85099485770}>, <Walrasian equilibrium-based multiobjective optimization for task allocation in mobile crowdsourcing, {eid: 85085993613}>, <A comprehensive survey for scheduling techniques in cloud computing, {eid: 85067581485}>, <Comparison analysis of round robin algorithm with highest response ratio next algorithm for job scheduling problems, {eid: 85128405167}>, <Decentralized task and path planning for multi-robot systems, {eid: 85103271294}>, <None, {eid: 84904867557}>, <None, {eid: 84965135289}>, <Efficient schedule of energy-constrained uav using crowdsourced buses in last-mile parcel delivery, {eid: 85103618278}>, <A combination of centralized and distributed methods for multi-agent planning and scheduling, {eid: 0025590732}>, <The internet of things (iot): Applications, investments, and challenges for enterprises, {eid: 84937634810}>, <Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges, {eid: 81355138524}>, <Mobile crowd sensing and computing, {eid: 84962007671}>, <Crowdpatrol: A mobile crowdsensing framework for traffic violation hotspot patrolling, {eid: 85148313073}>, <None, {eid: 33747614201}>, <Ethical issues in police robots.

This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of ""experiments""which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the ""5D model"".","digital twins, System architectures, System engineering",,,,,,,,"<2019 A featurebased framework for structuring industrial digital twins, {eid: 85077802084}>, <Digital twin-The simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <2020 Characterising the Digital Twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Feature-oriented domain analysis (FODA) feasibility study, {eid: 0003512056}>, <Variability modeling, {eid: 84904571448}>, <2018 Digital Twin in Manufacturing: A Categorical Literature Review and Classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <2021 Towards Development Platforms for Digital Twins: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach, {eid: 85115225554}>, <2017 A review of the roles of digital twin in CPS-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <2021 Specifying and Executing the Combination of Timed Finite State Automata and Causal-Block Diagrams by Mapping onto DEVS, {eid: 85126126778}>, <2022 Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Model-Based Systems Engineering: Extending the FTG+PM, {eid: 85138029889}>, <2021 Towards a Family of Digital Model/Shadow/TwinWorkflows and Architectures, {eid: 85125194285}>, <2021 Exploring a Digital Shadow Design Workflow by Means of a Line Following Robot Use-Case, {eid: 85117394052}>, <Dependency Modeling and Model Management in Mechatronic Design, {eid: 84884620987}>, <None, {eid: 85142920399}>, <2017 Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <2020 Systems architecture design pattern catalog for developing digital twins, {eid: 85090276654}>, <2021 Models Meet Data: Challenges to Create Virtual Entities for Digital Twins, {eid: 85124001119}>, <2017 the Modelverse: A Tool for Multi-Paradigm Modelling and Simulation, {eid: 85044546477}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-10-23,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85142927915

We enhance simulation metamodeling in two important ways. First, we use graph neural networks (GrNN) to allow the graphical structure of a simulation model to be treated as a metamodel input parameter that can be varied along with real-valued and integer-ordered inputs. Second, we combine GrNNs with generative neural networks so that a metamodel can rapidly produce not only a summary statistic like E[Y], but also a sequence of i.i.d. samples of Y or even a stochastic process that mimics dynamic simulation outputs. Thus a single metamodel can be used to estimate multiple statistics for multiple performance measures. Our metamodels can potentially serve as surrogate models in digital-twin settings.

A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below £10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above £81/tCO2 for every year.

Therefore, a high level of communication and coordination of all stakeholders and tasks is required for successful hospital management, starting with the planning of the building and especially for the utilization phase. This paper presents the opportunities and challenges of the digital method Building Information Modelling (BIM) in hospital construction for the building management to improve the health care service management. The relevant background information regarding BIM in general, hospital projects in which BIM has been applied, etc. was obtained by literature research. Based on background information obtained by literature research about BIM and the application in hospitals, guided interviews were conducted to determine the opportunities and challenges of BIM in hospital construction. In this process experts from the healthcare sector were interviewed who had already gained experience with the BIM application in single pilot projects. The evaluation of the interviews was carried out with qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Although BIM is applied as a digital method in construction industry, the benefits go beyond the construction perspective. A BIM model provides the necessary infrastructure to advance the digitalization of hospital services. The digital twin of the building can be considered as basis therefore. Besides the opportunities for the hospital building, there are presented possibilities in the utilization for health care service based on the BIM model, e.g. automated disinfection of door handles in the building. However, there are also challenges for the implementation and application of BIM, as for example the model needs to be constantly maintained by qualified personnel in order to ensure reliability.","BIM, Building Information Modeling, Digitalization in Hospitals, Hospital Construction",,,,,,,,"<Digitalization in healthcare: Implementing innovation and artificial intelligence2021, {eid: 85178061465}>, <BIM als lebenszyklusübergreifender Lösungsansatz im Krankenhausbau, {eid: 85178077872, doi: 10.25651/1.2022.0004}>, <2022.

To date, however, concepts have tended to be only implicit in software design with development being organized instead around more concrete artifacts (such as wireframes and code modules). Palantir, a software company whose data analytics products are widely used by major corporations, recently reworked the internal representation of its software development process to bring concepts to the fore, making explicit the concepts underlying its products, including how they are clustered together, used in applications, and governed by teams. With a centralized repository of concepts, Palantir engineers are able to align products more closely based on shared concepts, evolve concepts in response to user needs, and communicate more effectively with non-engineering groups within the company. This paper reports on Palantir's experiences to date, analyzing both successes and challenges, and offers advice to other organizations considering adopting a concept-centric approach to software development.","concepts, ontology, software design",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003752204}>, <None, {eid: 85161070801}>, <None, {eid: 0003407933}>, <1987.

Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a “digital twin” of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production.

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V's challenges and envisions IoTBD as ""Big Data 2.0.""Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.","big data 2.0, cloud computing in IoT, cloud IoT services, IoT big data, IoT big data survey, ""Vs challenges for IoT

ABMs may incur significant simulation times for large-scale business applications in the real world. A primary challenge is to reduce the simulation time while ensuring the functional correctness of the simulated application on the underlying hardware. This paper illustrates how a correct functional architecture of an application can significantly improve the application's simulation performance in terms of scalability and simulation time. We propose a metamodel to capture the communication patterns among various agents of an application deployed over ABM. This knowledge on learning communication patterns is used to design an optimally distributed software architecture for the application to minimize the number of messages communicated among agents. Further, we propose a performance model-based deployment of the architected application on the underlying hardware. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a use case from the telecom domain. We validate our results via detailed empirical analysis achieving a 517× gain for 1 million users in simulation time. We also scale to 50M users in barely 3.7 hours. The insights obtained from our experiments can serve as guidelines for system engineers, facilitating the process of scaling applications simulated using ABM simulators.","agent based model, agent interactions, capacity planning, performance acceleration, software design",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85131164292}>, <None, {eid: 85131151172}>, <Evaluation of Simulation Techniques for Modeling Progression of Construction Claims, {eid: 85116429812}>, <Balanced graph edge partition, {eid: 84907033604}>, <Recent advances in graph partitioning, {eid: 84995543402}>, <None, {eid: 84888730712}>, <ESL: An Actor-Based Platform for Developing Emergent Behaviour Organisation Simulations, {eid: 85131206483}>, <Decision support in productive processes through DES and ABS in the Digital Twin era: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85102693068}>, <Application Driven Graph Partitioning, {eid: 85086229454}>, <Flows in Agro-food Networks (FAN): An agent-based model to simulate local agricultural material flows, {eid: 85079519925}>, <None, {eid: 85131206630}>, <Easing the adoption of agent-based modelling (ABM) in tourism research, {eid: 84979538865}>, <None, {eid: 85131213523}>, <Integrating simulation into design: An experiment in pedagogical environments, {eid: 85108222161}>, <TopoX: Topology refactorization for efficient graph partitioning and processing, {eid: 85073970456}>, <Adaptive multi-resource prediction in distributed resource sharing environment, {eid: 4544339019}>, <Leveraging Digital Twin Technology in Model-Based Systems Engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <A scalable distributed graph partitioner, {eid: 84953872322}>, <An Actor-Based Software Framework for Developing and Simulating Complex Systems, {eid: 84868691262}>, <Virtual resource prediction in cloud environment: A Bayesian approach, {eid: 84960333087}>, <Fast Online Next Best Offers using Deep Learning, {eid: 85061114405}>, <Digital Twin Generation: Re-Conceptualizing Agent Systems for Behavior-Centered Cyber-Physical System Development, {eid: 85100473353}>, <An ensemble CPU load prediction algorithm using a Bayesian information criterion and smooth filters in a cloud computing environment, {eid: 85053735862}>, <FENNEL: Streaming graph partitioning for massive scale graphs, {eid: 84906877464}>, <A computing resources prediction approach based on ensemble learning for complex system simulation in cloud environment, {eid: 85096461036}>, <None, {eid: 85131165976}>, <Optimizing agent-based transmission models for infectious diseases, {eid: 84930656488}>, <Virtualising Space-New Directions for Applications of Agent-Based Modelling in Spatial Economics, {eid: 85131206300}>, <An agent-based model for simulating COVID-19 transmissions on university campus and its implications on mitigation interventions: A case study, {eid: 85106250296}>, <Topologies of agents interactions in knowledge intensive multi-agent systems for networked information services, {eid: 33644700417}>, <Agent-based modelling and flood risk management: A compendious literature review, {eid: 85092315127}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-06-12,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85131209163

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.

Zhao L. (AUID: 56355436400),Event Prediction in the Big Data Era: A Systematic Survey,2021,ACM Computing Surveys,62,10.1145/3450287,https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3450287,<Emory University>,,"© 2021 ACM.Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.","artificial intelligence, big data, Event prediction",,,,,,,,"<Forecasting of solar power ramp events: A post-processing approach, {eid:

Reinforcement learning (RL) solvers are adaptive and potentially robust in highly stochastic settings. However, benchmarking RL solutions for stochastic problems is challenging, requiring the simulation of complex production settings while guaranteeing reproducible stochasticity. No such simulation is currently available. To cover this gap, we introduce FabricatioRL, an RL compatible, customizable and extensible benchmarking simulation framework. Our contribution is twofold: We first derive requirements to ensure that generic production setups can be covered, the simulation framework can interface with both traditional approaches and RL, and experiments are reproducible. Then, we detail the FabricatioRL design and implementation satisfying the obtained requirements in terms of framework input, core simulation process, and the interface with different scheduling systems.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85126108078}>, <Collaborative reinforcement learning for a two-robot job transfer flow-shop scheduling problem, {eid: 84959322709}>, <Dynamic job-shop scheduling using reinforcement learning agents, {eid: 0034325416}>, <Flexible job shop scheduling by tabu search, {eid: 0037696818}>, <OR-library: Distributing test problems by electronic mail, {eid: 56449107505}>, <None, {eid: 85126119644}>, <OpenAI gym, {eid: 85056648071}>, <Benchmarks for shop scheduling problems, {eid: 0000418020}>, <Q-learning algorithm performance for m-machine, n-jobs flow shop scheduling problems to minimize makespan, {eid: 85019621318}>, <Distributed policy search reinforcement learning for job-shop scheduling tasks, {eid: 84858054371}>, <None, {eid: 85059179592}>, <Some guidelines and guarantees for common random numbers, {eid: 0000728309}>, <Soft actor-critic: Off-policy maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning with a stochastic actor, {eid: 85055258185}>, <Stable baselines, {eid: 85099838287}>, <Autonomous production control for matrix production based on deep q-learning, {eid: 85089090906}>, <Petri-net-based dynamic scheduling of flexible manufacturing system via deep reinforcement learning with graph convolutional network, {eid: 85079694318}>, <None, {eid: 85098812374}>, <None, {eid: 84937809422}>, <Designing an adaptive production control system using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85101947920}>, <Tensorforce: A tensorflow library for applied reinforcement learning, {eid: 85126118467}>, <Actor-critic deep reinforcement learning for solving job shop scheduling problems, {eid: 85084170875}>, <Dynamic scheduling for flexible job shop with new job insertions by deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85081140568}>, <Simulation and model-based design, {eid: 85126105403}>, <A multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm for jssp, {eid: 85072864863}>, <A reinforcement learning approach to robust scheduling of semiconductor manufacturing facilities, {eid: 85106441524}>, <None, {eid: 84866898775}>, <Keras-rl, {eid: 85098944882}>, <A centralized reinforcement learning approach for proactive scheduling in manufacturing, {eid: 84952931350}>, <A reinforcement learning approach for scheduling problems, {eid: 84937803432}>, <FabricatioRL, {eid: 85126109524}>, <Towards standardizing reinforcement learning approaches for stochastic production scheduling, {eid: 85126105352}>, <None, {eid: 85105540954}>, <A reinforcement learning approach to parameter estimation in dynamic job shop scheduling, {eid: 85019975083}>, <Plant simulation documentation, {eid: 85126111348}>, <Mastering the game of go without human knowledge, {eid: 85031918331}>, <Reinforcement learning for adaptive order dispatching in the semiconductor industry, {eid: 85045954603}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Minerva: A reinforcement learning-based technique for optimal scheduling and bottleneck detection in distributed factory operations, {eid: 85051020373}>, <Application of reinforcement learning for agent-based production scheduling, {eid: 10844274625}>, <Adaptive job shop scheduling strategy based on weighted q-learning algorithm, {eid: 85056321676}>, <Optimization of global production scheduling with deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85048864239}>, <Learning to dispatch for job shop scheduling via deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85108393338}>, <High-performance job-shop scheduling with a time-delay td (l) network, {eid: 85156225449}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-12-12,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85126126475

However, dynamic pricing schemes need to be designed carefully to consider fairness and benefits for consumers as well as power companies. This paper describes an ML-based simulation framework for exploring two fairness constructs of dynamic pricing for residential electricity with behavioral agent-based models based on social theory combined with active learning. As an example, we simulate behavior adaptations in response to changes in electricity prices to study cost savings through monthly bills and peak demand reduction in synthetic household agents in a Time Of Use (TOU) pricing scheme in Virginia, USA. Further, we can show that there exists a region in the parameter space that corresponds to a fair TOU pricing scheme for both entities: all income-stratified communities and power companies.","active learning, agent behavior simulation, complex systems, dynamic pricing, fairness, smart grid, UN SDG",,,,,,,,"<An incentive based dynamic pricing in smart grid: A customers perspective, {eid: 85107812163, doi: 10.3390/su13116066}>, <A Fair Pricing Mechanism in Smart Grids for Low Energy Consumption Users, {eid: 85100786323, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056035}>, <Rate Design Matters: The Intersection of Residential Rate Design and Energy Efficiency, {eid: 85075502292}>, <Fairness Through the Lens of Proportional Equality, {eid: 85076926660}>, <None, {eid: 0003762575, doi: 10.1016/j.energy.2022.124978}>, <None, {eid: 84899767766}>, <None, {eid: 85053385065}>, <None, {eid: 85053385065}>, <Time-of-Use Pricing in Electricity Markets Under Different Market Structures, {eid: 84864287299, doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2180935}>, <Real-time price-based demand response management for residential appliances via stochastic optimization and robust optimization, {eid: 84872075033, doi: 10.1109/TSG.2012.2212729}>, <A game-theoretic approach to optimize the Time-of-Use pricing considering customer behaviors, {eid: 85048151240, doi: 10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.04.02}>, <Increasing Fairness by Delegating Decisions to Autonomous Agents, {eid: 85046479151}>, <None, {eid: 85121492925}>, <A literature review on dynamic pricing of electricity, {eid: 85020738916, doi: 10.1057/s41274-016-0149-4}>, <Fairness through awareness, {eid: 84856446756, doi: 10.1145/2090236.2090255}>, <Group-Fair Classification with Strategic Agents, {eid: 85163620298, doi: 10.1145/3593013.3594006}>, <None, {eid: 85196425132}>, <SPEW: Synthetic Populations and Ecosystems of the World, {eid: 85048357081, doi: 10.1080/10618600.2018.1442342}>, <The ODD protocol: A review and first update, {eid: 77957301158, doi: 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.08.019}>, <Dynamic tariffs, demand response, and regulation in retail electricity markets, {eid: 85122730423, doi: 10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105774}>, <Residential implementation of critical-peak pricing of electricity, {eid: 33845531540, doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2006.06.019}>, <None, {eid: 85172563073}>, <A review on demand response: Pricing, optimization, and appliance scheduling, {eid: 84939212244, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.141}>, <Prime-time access for whom?

However, most studies on the HHCRSP are based on deterministic models that do not consider any disruptions that may compromise the execution of the schedules. In this paper, we analyze the impact of different sources of disturbances on a deterministic schedule: delays at the start of the route, variability of travel time, and variability of service processing time. Simulation has been chosen because it helps to easily model and analyze complex environments with several sources of variability. Graphical representations and an analysis of variance are presented to interpret the results, leading to several managerial insights and openings for future research.",,,,,,,,,"<A Multi-Objective Approach to the Optimization of Home Care Visits Scheduling, {eid: 85147445601}>, <Scheduling of Home Health Care Services Based on Multi-Agent Systems, {eid: 85049373441}>, <An Integrated Spatial DSS for Scheduling and Routing Home-Health-Care Nurses, {eid: 0040651973}>, <A Hybrid Setup for a Hybrid Scenario: Combining Heuristics for the Home Health Care Problem, {eid: 32144456857}>, <La population de la France métropolitaine en 2050 : Un vieillissement inéluctable, {eid: 0344549110}>, <Home Care Optimization: Impact of Pattern Generation Policies on Scheduling and Routing Decisions, {eid: 84879731723}>, <Demand Uncertainty in Robust Home Care Optimization, {eid: 85030232822}>, <A Cardinality-Constrained Robust Model for the Assignment Problem in Home Care Services, {eid: 84896489756}>, <None, {eid: 32144436516}>, <OR problems related to Home Health Care: A review of relevant routing and scheduling problems, {eid: 85024861944}>, <The Truck Dispatching Problem, {eid: 0001953950}>, <Routing and Scheduling in Home Health Care: A Literature Survey and Bibliometric Analysis, {eid: 85107811861}>, <A Set of Efficient Heuristics for a Home Healthcare Problem, {eid: 85062715070}>, <Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling: A Review, {eid: 84980347924}>, <Operational Research Applied to Decisions in Home Health Care: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85115283107}>, <A Decision Support System for Home Dialysis Visit Scheduling and Nurse Routing, {eid: 85076562098}>, <Jointly Rostering, Routing, and Rerostering for Home Health Care Services: A Harmony Search Approach with Genetic, Saturation, Inheritance, and Immigrant Schemes, {eid: 85034020967}>, <A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for the Home-Caregiver Scheduling and Routing Problem with Stochastic Travel and Service Times, {eid: 85053806061}>, <Grid-Enabled Evolution Strategies for Large-Scale Home Care Crew Scheduling, {eid: 85055629189}>, <A Multi-agent System Based on Reactive Decision Rules for Solving the Caregiver Routing Problem in Home Health Care, {eid: 85016066170}>, <Continuity of Care in Home Services: A Client-centered Heuristic for the Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem, {eid: 85050202235}>, <An Analysis of Generalised Heuristics for Vehicle Routing and Personnel Rostering Problems, {eid: 84928150521}>, <None, {eid: 0003486756}>, <Flexible Home Care Scheduling, {eid: 85041911393}>, <Simulation in the Design and Operation of Manufacturing Systems: State of the Art and New Trends, {eid: 85068546250}>, <A Robust-MILP for Synchronized-mTSPTW: Application to Home Health Care under Uncertainties, {eid: 85045569460}>, <Solving a More Flexible Home Health Care Scheduling and Routing Problem with Joint Patient and Nursing Staff Selection, {eid: 85040190112}>, <None, {eid: 84944580146}>, <Staff Dimensioning in Homecare Services with Uncertain Demands, {eid: 84980356615}>, <A Robust Optimization for a Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem with Consideration of Uncertain Travel and Service Times, {eid: 85066751017}>, <A Feasible Nurse Routing Plan for the Elderly: Quality and Spatial Trade-Offs, {eid: 85120713735}>, <Securing Home Health Care in Times of Natural Disasters, {eid: 79959711997}>, <Optimization of Daily Scheduling for Home Health Care Services, {eid: 84887187631}>, <Optimizing Home Hospital Health Service Delivery in Norway Using a Combined Geographical Information System, Agent Based, Discrete Event Simulation Model, {eid: 85044506859}>, <Patient-Based Nurse Rostering in Home Care, {eid: 84960154923}>, <A Periodic Repair Algorithm for Dynamic Scheduling in Home Health Care Using Agent-based Model, {eid: 85034117276}>, <The Patient Assignment Problem in Home Health Care: Using a Data-Driven Method to Estimate the Travel Times of Care Givers, {eid: 84957968598}>, <Disruption Management for the Real-Time Home Caregiver Scheduling and Routing Problem, {eid: 85034971494}>, <A Branch-and-price Algorithm for the Home Health Care Scheduling and Routing Problem with Stochastic Service Times and Skill Requirements, {eid: 84991034202}>, <Stakeholders Tolerance-Based Linear Model for Home Health Care Coordination, {eid: 85120699180}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-12-11,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85147443631

Matrix production characterized by freely linked workstations and an advanced automation level are highly flexible. That is why many efforts have already been made to explore the advantages compared to existing flow shop production systems, but also the additional challenges arising from this new paradigm. One of these challenges is the synchronization of main product and supply part flow at the individual workstations during order scheduling. This paper presents a new approach of integrating logistics support processes into the scheduling of the main product flow to consider the part supply in the decisions taken during scheduling avoiding waiting times. We compare our integrated approach with the existing decoupled scheduling approach, based on a ""bicycle assembly""scenario.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Metaverse is expected to emerge as a new paradigm for the next-generation Internet, providing fully immersive and personalized experiences to socialize, work, and play in self-sustaining and hyper-spatio-temporal virtual world(s). The advancements in different technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G/6G communication will be the key enablers behind the realization of AI-XR metaverse applications. While AI itself has many potential applications in the aforementioned technologies (e.g., avatar generation, network optimization), ensuring the security of AI in critical applications like AI-XR metaverse applications is profoundly crucial to avoid undesirable actions that could undermine users' privacy and safety, consequently putting their lives in danger. To this end, we attempt to analyze the security, privacy, and trustworthiness aspects associated with the use of various AI techniques in AI-XR metaverse applications. Specifically, we discuss numerous such challenges and present a taxonomy of potential solutions that could be leveraged to develop secure, private, robust, and trustworthy AI-XR applications. To highlight the real implications of AI-associated adversarial threats, we designed a metaverse-specific case study and analyzed it through the adversarial lens. Finally, we elaborate upon various open issues that require further research interest from the community.","AR, Metaverse, MR, robust ML, secure ML, trustworthy ML, VR, XR",,,,,,,,"<Deep learning with differential privacy, {eid: 84995527907}>, <Peeking inside the black-box: A survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), {eid: 85053352477}>, <Investigating adversarial attacks against network intrusion detection systems in SDNs, {eid: 85082997252}>, <Advances in adversarial attacks and defenses in computer vision: A survey, {eid: 85119405946}>, <None, {eid: 85148311154}>, <None, {eid: 85138064255}>, <SSCNets: Robustifying DNNs using secure selective convolutional filters, {eid: 85076858903}>, <Tamp-X: Attacking explainable natural language classifiers through tampered activations, {eid: 85131824415}>, <All your fake detector are belong to us: Evaluating adversarial robustness of fake-news detectors under black-box settings, {eid: 85107327225}>, <Condetect: Detecting adversarially perturbed natural language inputs to deep classifiers through holistic analysis, {eid: 85164291975}>, <None, {eid: 85109378359}>, <Intelligent resource slicing for eMBB and URLLC coexistence in 5G and beyond: A deep reinforcement learning based approach, {eid: 85101828253}>, <On the robustness of semantic segmentation models to adversarial attacks, {eid: 85062833643}>, <Scalable quantitative verification for deep neural networks, {eid: 85115685315}>, <Botnets and internet of things security, {eid: 85012917393}>, <Evasion attacks againstmachine learning at test time, {eid: 84886493283}>, <Poisoning attacks against support vector machines, {eid: 84867136631}>, <None, {eid: 85124553655}>, <Implementation and evaluation of an algorithm for cryptographically private principal component analysis on genomic data, {eid: 85050407665}>, <Practical secure aggregation for privacy-preserving machine learning, {eid: 85041432607}>, <Machine learning classification over encrypted data, {eid: 85098887199}>, <Bad characters: Imperceptible NLP attacks, {eid: 85132050626}>, <Security and privacy in the metaverse: The threat of the digital human, {eid: 85146374420}>, <None, {eid: 0003629991}>, <Convolutional neural network based vehicle classification in adverse illuminous conditions for intelligent transportation systems, {eid: 85101547601}>, <CARL-D: A vision benchmark suite and large scale dataset for vehicle detection and scene segmentation, {eid: 85125566419}>, <How blockchain, virtual reality, and augmented reality are converging, and why, {eid: 85091949011}>, <Adversarial examples are not easily detected: Bypassing ten detection methods, {eid: 85037338309}>, <Immersive virtual reality attacks and the human joystick, {eid: 85063680301}>, <Adversarial face de-identification, {eid: 85076808275}>, <Digital twin for federated analytics using a Bayesian approach, {eid: 85111025514}>, <Artificial neural networks-based machine learning for wireless networks: A tutorial, {eid: 85068579797}>, <BadNL: Backdoor attacks against NLP models, {eid: 85122985610}>, <Backdoor attacks and defenses for deep neural networks in outsourced cloud environments, {eid: 85083020019}>, <None, {eid: 85130135994}>, <The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding, {eid: 84986255616}>, <Fast geometrically-perturbed adversarial faces, {eid: 85063577936}>, <Security and privacy approaches in mixed reality: A literature survey, {eid: 85074401367}>, <ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, {eid: 85198028989}>, <Metaverse: Security and privacy issues, {eid: 85128732171}>, <Efficient decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on face recognition, {eid: 85078797309}>, <None, {eid: 85122052584}>, <Differential privacy, {eid: 84903633242}>, <None, {eid: 85067610282}>, <The social metaverse: Battle for privacy, {eid: 85048243688}>, <Applying digital twins in metaverse: User interface, security and privacy challenges, {eid: 85139640982}>, <None, {eid: 85056850878}>, <FIBA: Frequency-injection based backdoor attack in medical image analysis, {eid: 85136008370}>, <None, {eid: 85134367822}>, <None, {eid: 85041911090}>, <Falling for fake news: Investigating the consumption of news via social media, {eid: 85046956316}>, <None, {eid: 85137666120}>, <None, {eid: 85095195855}>, <None, {eid: 84943527827}>, <Unravelling robustness of deep learning based face recognition against adversarial attacks, {eid: 85060489154}>, <None, {eid: 84960366468}>, <BadNets: Evaluating backdooring attacks on deep neural networks, {eid: 85065097252}>, <A survey of methods for explaining black box models, {eid: 85052502285}>, <None, {eid: 85030164208}>, <Virtual and augmented reality in surgery, {eid: 85088467653}>, <AdvPC: Transferable adversarial perturbations on 3D point clouds, {eid: 85093089308}>, <Adversarial example defense: Ensembles of weak defenses are not strong, {eid: 85084159861}>, <What do avatars want now?

Because the productivity of semiconductor FABs is significantly influenced by their material-handling systems, existing research has focused on optimizing operational logic considering both aspects. However, the scale and complexity of modern FABs make implementation of fully integrated models challenging, resulting in slow simulation speeds for long periods. To address this issue, we propose a multi-resolution modeling framework that creates material-handling system models at two distinct resolution levels, enabling fast, fully integrated FAB models while accounting for material-handling effects. Experimental results demonstrated accelerated simulation completion compared to single-resolution models while maintaining consistent results.

However, using trajectory datasets can also be challenging, particularly in different countries. This article aims to explore the challenges of using trajectory datasets, specifically using focus group discussions. Focus groups are a qualitative method of gaining a deeper understanding of a particular topic and have not been previously used to examine the challenges related to trajectory datasets.

The process flow in the ATO system is complex as the system needs to handle a variety of products, different process routings, high product mix, and shared resources. The simulation model is developed using an existing commercial software platform. The model is designed to be fully data-driven, with sets of input and output data schema tables. This approach will make the simulation modeling more accessible to manufacturing community, and enable integration to factory's Manufacturing Execution System (MES) for real-time data and Real Time Dashboard (RTD) for displaying multiple scenarios of simulation results.

We drew inspiration from manual qualitative research methods for mining patterns and architectural knowledge and created a guideline model of which the ADD models are instances. We evaluated our approach on 11 cases from the gray literature. We found that it can provide suitable recommendations after modeling only a single case and reaches theoretical saturation and recommendations with low to very low errors after only 6-8 cases. Our approach shows that creating a reusable architectural design space is possible based only on limited case data. Our approach not only provides a novel approach to architectural knowledge management but can also be used as a tool for pattern mining.","Architectural Design Decisions, Architectural Knowledge Management, Design Patterns",,,,,,,,"<Mining software architecture knowledge: Classifying stack overflow posts using machine learning, {eid: 85103414567}>, <Architectural decision-making as a financial investment: An industrial case study, {eid: 85091712928}>, <A Tool for Managing Software Architecture Knowledge, {eid: 38549118514}>, <Automatic Extraction of Design Decisions from Issue Management Systems: A Machine Learning Based Approach, {eid: 85185226532}>, <ADeX: A Tool for Automatic Curation of Design Decision Knowledge for Architectural Decision Recommendations, {eid: 85066486486}>, <Universal Sentence Encoder, {eid: 85062784462}>, <Grounded theory research: Procedures, canons, and evaluative criteria, {eid: 34247732721}>, <Supporting Architecture Documentation: A Comparison of Two Ontologies for Knowledge Retrieval, {eid: 84961195074}>, <None, {eid: 0003424343}>, <Using Patterns to Capture Architectural Decisions, {eid: 34547120204}>, <An Approach for Pattern Mining through Grounded Theory Techniques and Its Applications to Process-Driven SOA Patterns, {eid: 84958755761}>, <Workshop Report: Conversation Patterns, {eid: 84872237331}>, <None, {eid: 85066829803}>, <None, {eid: 85185226245}>, <Software Architecture as a Set of Architectural Design Decisions, {eid: 33947154413}>, <None, {eid: 0141562681}>, <None, {eid: 44649122227}>, <Markdown Architectural Decision Records: Format and Tool Support, {eid: 85185217545}>, <An Ontology of Architectural Design Decisions in Software-Intensive Systems, {eid: 33947105674}>, <A Decision-Making Tool to Support Architectural Designs Based on Quality Attributes, {eid: 84955445032}>, <Reusable Architectural Decision Models for Quality-Driven Decision Support: A Case Study from a Smart Cities Software Ecosystem, {eid: 84954427830}>, <Two Controlled Experiments on Model-Based Architectural Decision Making, {eid: 84928139326}>, <Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality, {eid: 84898956512}>, <ArchLearner: Leveraging Machine-Learning Techniques for Proactive Architectural Adaptation, {eid: 85081975945}>, <Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures, {eid: 85072835777}>, <None, {eid: 84943287410}>, <An Architectural Decision Tool Based on Scenarios and Non-functional Requirements, {eid: 85185222038}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: An update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <None, {eid: 85034017796}>, <None, {eid: 85108312737}>, <Architectural design decisions that incur technical debt — An industrial case study, {eid: 85109165765}>, <Exploring Web Search Engines to Find Architectural Knowledge, {eid: 85106990641}>, <Machine learning for architectural design: Practices and infrastructure, {eid: 85048878659}>, <A comparative study of architecture knowledge management tools, {eid: 75349102679}>, <Capturing and Making Architectural Decisions: An Open Source Online Tool, {eid: 84907389202}>, <Architecture decisions: demystifying architecture, {eid: 17644408022}>, <None, {eid: 84949178783}>, <Detecting Architectural Integrity Violation Patterns Using Machine Learning, {eid: 85083030688}>, <Research on string similarity algorithm based on Levenshtein Distance, {eid: 85034593536}>, <Architectural Decisions as Reusable Design Assets, {eid: 78650657592}>, <Combining pattern languages and reusable architectural decision models into a comprehensive and comprehensible design method, {eid: 49949107061}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-07-05,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85185224166

In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study to assess the state of the art and practice of robotics software engineering. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with industrial practitioners working in 15 companies from 9 different countries and a survey with 156 respondents from 26 countries from the robotics domain.

Now, companies must mass produce to keep costs low, but they must also be flexible and offer a wide variety of products. Thus, companies are increasingly using computational tools to improve decision making, especially with the application of simulation and digitization of production systems. However, online data collection is presenting itself as a solution to decrease the time for the development of simulation models and, thus, speed up decision making. In this way, this work shows the steps required for online data exchange between a real system and a virtual production system.

Methods: MRI image enhancement method based on metamaterial composite technology is proposed by analyzing the application status of DTs in medical direction and the principle of MRI imaging. On the basis of deep transfer learning, MRI super-resolution deep neural network structure is established. To address the problem that different medical imaging methods have advantages and disadvantages, a multi-mode medical image fusion algorithm based on adaptive decomposition is proposed and verified by experiments. Results: the optimal Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 34.11dB can be obtained by introducing modified linear element and loss function of deep transfer learning neural network structure. The Structural Similarity Coefficient (SSIM) is 85.24%. It indicates that the MRI truthfulness and sharpness obtained by adding composite metasurface are improved greatly. The proposed medical image fusion algorithm has the highest overall score in the subjective evaluation of the six groups of fusion image results. Group III had the highest score in Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Positron Emission Computed Tomography (MRI-PET) image fusion, with a score of 4.67, close to the full score of 5. As for the objective evaluation in group I of Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (MRI-SPECT) images, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Relative Average Spectral Error (RASE) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) are the highest, which are 39.2075, 116.688, and 0.594, respectively. Mutual Information (MI) is 5.8822. Conclusion: the proposed algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in preserving spatial details of MRI images and color information direction of SPECT images, and the other five groups have achieved similar results.","adaptive medical image fusion, deep transfer learning, Digital twins, MRI image enhancement, multimodal image fusion",,,,,,,,"<Training-And test-Time data augmentation for hyperspectral image segmentation, {eid: 85078524194}>, <Mathematical models for magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction: An overview of the approaches, problems, and future research areas, {eid: 85078529363}>, <Plug-And-play methods for magnetic resonance imaging: Using denoisers for image recovery, {eid: 85078536214}>, <Conductive thread-based stretchable and flexible radiofrequency coils for magnetic resonance imaging, {eid: 85085894114}>, <Prediction of hypertension risks with feature selection and xgboost, {eid: 85104879200}>, <COVID-19 detection through transfer learning using multimodal imaging data, {eid: 85090281227}>, <Widespread subcortical grey matter degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis: A multimodal imaging study with genetic profiling, {eid: 85075205606}>, <Application of the best evacuation model of deep learning in the design of public structures, {eid: 85088504188}>, <A novel intelligent medical decision support model based on soft computing and ioT, {eid: 85084916516}>, <Research on hierarchical data fusion of intelligent medical monitoring, {eid: 85081588982}>, <Intelligent medical IoT system based on WSN with computer vision platforms, {eid: 85054920935}>, <Health care in the cyberspace: Medical cyber-physical system and digital twin challenges, {eid: 85081088828}>, <A state of the art of digital twin and simulation supported by data mining in the healthcare sector, {eid: 85082074463}>, <Digital twin in the IoT context: A survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models, {eid: 85087488936}>, <Medical digital twin-based dynamic virtual body capture system, {eid: 85168042936}>, <An ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework for health and well-being in smart cities, {eid: 85086741550}>, <Digital twins: Bridging physical space and cyberspace, {eid: 85075743259}>, <A novel cloud-based framework for the elderly healthcare services using digital twin, {eid: 85065103886}>, <Compressed sensing: From research to clinical practice with deep neural networks: Shortening scan times for magnetic resonance imaging, {eid: 85078543888}>, <Deep-learning methods for parallel magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction: A survey of the current approaches, trends, and issues, {eid: 85078525893}>, <Imaging phenotypes of breast cancer heterogeneity in preoperative breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans predict 10-year recurrence, {eid: 85079369157}>, <3-D block-rooting scheme with application to medical image enhancement, {eid: 85098791837}>, <Genetic algorithm based adaptive histogram equalization (GAAHE) technique for medical image enhancement, {eid: 85100086904}>, <FaultNet3D: Predicting fault probabilities, strikes, and dips with a single convolutional neural network, {eid: 85071864557}>, <Skin lesion segmentation with improved convolutional neural network, {eid: 85085100289}>, <Stabilization of robots with a regulator containing the sigmoid mapping, {eid: 85085553498}>, <Hierarchical neural architecture search for single image super-resolution, {eid: 85089583765}>, <Efficient medical image enhancement based on CNN-FBB model, {eid: 85072022903}>, <Laplacian redecomposition for multimodal medical image fusion, {eid: 85085219315}>, <Gradient-guided convolutional neural network for MRI image super-resolution, {eid: 85075258407}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-07-01,35439137,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85128681609

Compared with traditional operating systems, one of the fundamental requirements of UOS is to adaptively manage numerous heterogeneous sensors according to dynamic environments and diverse tasks. However, traditional management focuses on the sensors' parameters and interfaces without highlighting the perception effect that is users' concern and dynamic changing. It also lacks a unified management approach for heterogeneous sensors. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensors dynamic management model UbiCap, i.e., Ubiquitous Capability, which is based on the capability abstraction and adaptive run-time capability management mechanism. The capability provides a unified abstract for heterogeneous sensors. The adaptive run-time capability management mechanism transfers the management object from low-level hardware sensors to high-level sensing capability. The capability required and the available capability are matched to support run-time adaptive sensors selection. We implement a software prototype iS2ROS(intelligent Sensor Selection Robot Operating System) based on the UbiCap model. We then simulate a forest fire spot monitoring scenario where iS2ROS selects the optimal image sensor during the identification task execution while light or weather condition changes. Experiment results show that the iS2ROS achieves comparative sensing effectiveness through UbiCap with 50% power consumption lower compared to the traditional both-sensors approach.","adaptive, Capability, Heterogeneous Sensors Management, run-time, Ubiquitous Operating System",,,,,,,,"<Models@ run.time, {eid: 85008066028}>, <None, {eid: 85061076852}>, <Distributed graph queries over models@run.time for runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85074030886}>, <XiUOS:an opensource ubiquitous operating system for industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85129756045}>, <Approach to Modeling and Executing Context-aware Services of Smart Home at Runtime, {eid: 85077392389}>, <Wireless sensor network management method based on runtime model, {eid: 85175740165}>, <Models@runtime and Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85111470523}>, <OCCICompliant, Fully Causal-Connected Architecture Runtime Models Supporting Sensor Management, {eid: 85071096320}>, <SM@RT: towards architecturebased runtime management of Internetware systems, {eid: 72249119446}>, <The 20-year Periodic Law of Operating System Transition and Ubiquitous Computing, {eid: 85175726667}>, <Ubiquitous Operating System: Toward the Blue Ocean of Human-cyber-physical Ternary Ubiquitous Computing, {eid: 85135623006}>, <Toward Ubiquitous Operating Systems: A SoftwareDefined Perspective, {eid: 85050968009}>, <Sensor Selection Optimization with Genetic Algorithms, {eid: 85078699592}>, <Runtime Deployment, Management and Monitoring of Web of Things Systems, {eid: 85115382268}>, <A Runtime Resource Management and Provisioning Middleware for Fog Computing Infrastructures, {eid: 85134877774}>, <UAV Selection for a UAV-Based Integrative IoT Platform, {eid: 85015393508}>, <Self-Adaptation for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 84974536575}>, <Towards Semantic Management of On-Device Applications in Industrial IoT, {eid: 85141396512}>, <Use case driven approach for ontologybased modeling of reconnaissance resources on-board UAVs using OWL, {eid: 85021198778}>, <Fault tolerant sensing model for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85175726189}>, <EGO: Optimized Sensor Selection for Multi-Context Aware Applications with an Ontology for Recognition Models, {eid: 85056329623}>, <Self-adaptive Systems Driven by Runtime Models, {eid: 85029471104}>, <Task allocation of multiple UAVs considering cooperative route planning, {eid: 85096485450}>, <Research on CPS resource service model and resource scheduling, {eid: 85055411129}>, <Adaptive Sensor Selection for Nonlinear Tracking via Sparsity-Promoting Approaches, {eid: 85041797998}>, <Survey of machine learning enabled software self-adaptation, {eid: 85089897087}>, <Management of Intelligent Campus Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Runtime Model, {eid: 85018246697}>, <Overview of modelbased adaptive methods, {eid: 85049434119}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-08-04,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85175707578

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Simulation has become, in many application areas, a sine qua non. Most recently, COVID-19 has underlined the importance of simulation studies and limitations in current practices and methods. We identify four goals of methodological work for addressing these limitations. The first is to provide better support for capturing, representing, and evaluating the context of simulation studies, including research questions, assumptions, requirements, and activities contributing to a simulation study. In addition, the composition of simulation models and other simulation studies’ products must be supported beyond syntactical coherence, including aspects of semantics and purpose, enabling their effective reuse. A higher degree of automating simulation studies will contribute to more systematic, standardized simulation studies and their efficiency. Finally, it is essential to invest increased effort into effectively communicating results and the processes involved in simulation studies to enable their use in research and decision making. These goals are not pursued independently of each other, but they will benefit from and sometimes even rely on advances in other sub-fields. In this article, we explore the basis and interdependencies evident in current research and practice and delineate future research directions based on these considerations.","automation,

For such applications, uncertainty in real-life environments presents a significant challenge in training an RL agent. RL requires a large number of trials (training examples) to learn a good policy. One of the approaches to tackle these obstacles is augmenting RL with a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model. Learning from a simulated environment, makes the training process of the RL agent more efficient, faster, and even safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world trials. Therefore, integrating RL algorithms with simulation environments has inspired many researchers in recent years. In this paper, we analyze the existing literature on RL models using DES to put forward the benefits, application areas, challenges, and scope for future work in developing such models for industrial use cases.",,,,,,,,,"<A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Replenishment Policy in A Vendor Managed Inventory Setting For Semiconductors, {eid: 85103875725}>, <Optimal Sequential Decision Making with Probabilistic Digital Twins, {eid: 85137100779}>, <Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Brief Survey, {eid: 85040312540}>, <Optimising Discrete Event Simulation Models Using a Reinforcement Learning Agent, {eid: 0036923783}>, <Modeling and Control of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: A Simulator-Based Reinforcement-Learning Paradigm, {eid: 33745227898}>, <Integrating Production Planning with Truck-Dispatching Decisions through Reinforcement Learning While Managing Uncertainty, {eid: 85106872083}>, <Reinforcement Learning in Anylogic Simulation Models: A Guiding Example Using Pathmind, {eid: 85103893652}>, <Simulation-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning For Modular Production Systems, {eid: 85103891394}>, <Reinforcement Learning: ATutorial Survey and Recent Advances, {eid: 67649964731}>, <Architectures for Combining Discrete-event Simulation and Machine Learning, {eid: 85091802171}>, <Real-Time Decision Making for a Car Manufacturing Process Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85103878644}>, <None, {eid: 85098812374}>, <A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm to Minimize the Mean Tardiness of a Single Machine with Controlled Capacity, {eid: 46149121551}>, <On Scheduling a Photolithograhy Toolset Based on a Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach with Action Filter, {eid: 85126095083}>, <Integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Discrete-Event Simulation for Real-Time Scheduling of a Flexible Job Shop Production, {eid: 85103875699}>, <Task Selection by Autonomous Mobile Robots in a Warehouse Using Deep Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85081137505}>, <Dynamic Multi-Objective Scheduling for Flexible Job Shop by Deep Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85123364951}>, <A Review on Reinforcement Learning: Introduction and Applications in Industrial Process Control, {eid: 85084367877}>, <None, {eid: 85093370361}>, <A Reinforcement Learning Approach for a Decision Support System for Logistics Networks, {eid: 84962868631}>, <Fabricatio-Rl: A Reinforcement Learning Simulation Framework for Production Scheduling, {eid: 85126126475}>, <Optimizing Earth Moving Operations Via Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85081133327}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Optimization of Global Production Scheduling with Deep Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85048864239}>, <Development of a Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm for Block Assembly Production Line, {eid: 85126100865}>, <Real-time Batching in Job Shops Based on Simulation and Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85062641751}>, <Flexible Control of Discrete Event Systems Using Environment Simulation and Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85111066351}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-12-11,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85147457182

Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.","Emergent behavior, Systematic mapping study, Systems-of-Systems",,,,,,,,"<A

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure.

Nowhere is this more true than in mining operations which present a dynamic and dangerous environment for human operators. Drones can be deployed in a number of contexts including efficient surveying as well as search and rescue missions. Operating in these dynamic contexts is challenging however and requires the drones control software to detect and adapt to conditions at run-time.To help in the development of such systems we present Aloft, a simulation supported testbed for investigating self-adaptive controllers for drones in mines. Aloft utilises the Robot Operating system (ROS) and a model environment using Gazebo to provide a physics-based testing. The simulation environment is constructed from a 3D point cloud collected in a physical mock-up of a mine and contains features expected to be found in real-world contexts.Aloft allows members of the research community to deploy their own self-adaptive controllers into the control loop of the drone to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of controllers in a challenging environment. To demonstrate our system we provide a self-adaptive drone controller and operating scenario as an exemplar. The self-adaptive drone controller provided utilises a two-layered architecture with a MAPE-K feedback loop. The scenario is an inspection task during which we inject a communications failure. The aim of the controller is to detect this loss of communication and autonomously perform a return home behaviour. Limited battery life presents a constraint on the mission, which therefore means that the drone should complete its mission as fast as possible. Humans, however, might also be present within the environment. This poses a safety risk and the drone must be able to avoid collisions during autonomous flight.In this paper we describe the controller framework and the simulation environment and provide information on how a user might construct and evaluate their own controllers in the presence of disruptions at run-time.","controller framework testing, mining operations, self-adaptive systems, unmanned aerial vehicles",,,,,,,,"<RoboMAX: Robotic Mission Adaptation eXemplars, {eid: 85113508093}>, <None, {eid: 85065158665}>, <Extending MAPE-K to support human-machine teaming, {eid: 85134186800}>, <Human-Machine Teaming with Small Unmanned Aerial Systems in a MAPE-K Environment, {eid: 85191257939}>, <Global UGV path planning on point cloud maps created by UAV, {eid: 85057287386}>, <Synthesis of probabilistic models for quality-of-service software engineering, {eid: 85047156835}>, <Deep reinforcement learning for drone navigation using sensor data, {eid: 85086867770}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062}>, <None, {eid: 85196411476}>, <Dragonfly: A Tool for Simulating Self-Adaptive Drone Behaviours, {eid: 85071132558}>, <A survey on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning in robotics with a tutorial on deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85119108562}>, <DARTSim: An exemplar for evaluation and comparison of self-adaptation approaches for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85071079019}>, <Applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Mining from Exploration to Reclamation: A Review, {eid: 85090655666}>, <Self-Adaptive Mechanisms for Misconfigurations in Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems, {eid: 85166342200}>, <ROS: An open-source Robot Operating System, {eid: 77957352104}>, <DARPA Subterranean Challenge: Multi-robotic Exploration of Underground Environments, {eid: 85083703360}>, <Drones in underground mines: Challenges and applications, {eid: 85151059092}>, <SUAVE: An Exemplar for Self-Adaptive Underwater Vehicles, {eid: 85166327224}>, <None, {eid: 85196380542}>, <Integrated navigation for autonomous drone in GPS and GPS-denied environments, {eid: 85049181831}>, <None, {eid: 85196401879}>, <VFH/sup ∗/: Local obstacle avoidance with look-ahead verification, {eid: 0033692392}>, <Supporting Search and Rescue Operations with UAVs, {eid: 78649420820}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2024-04-15,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85196410163

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.","artificial intelligence, digital twins, Marine

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The synthetic control method has pioneered a class of powerful data-driven techniques to estimate the counterfactual reality of a unit from donor units. At its core, the technique involves a linear model fitted on the pre-intervention period that combines donor outcomes to yield the counterfactual. However, linearly combining spatial information at each time instance using time-agnostic weights fails to capture important inter-unit and intra-unit temporal contexts and complex nonlinear dynamics of real data. We instead propose an approach to use local spatiotemporal information before the onset of the intervention as a promising way to estimate the counterfactual sequence. To this end, we suggest a Transformer model that leverages particular positional embeddings, a modified decoder attention mask, and a novel pre-training task to perform spatiotemporal sequence-to-sequence modeling. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the efficacy of our method in the typical small donor pool setting and its robustness against noise. We also generate actionable healthcare insights at the population and patient levels by simulating a state-wide public health policy to evaluate its effectiveness, an in silico trial for asthma medications to support randomized controlled trials, and a medical intervention for patients with Friedreich's ataxia to improve clinical decision making and promote personalized therapy (code is available at https://github.com/JHA-Lab/scout).","Causal inference, precision medicine, randomized trials, synthetic control, transformers",,,,,,,,"<Using synthetic controls: Feasibility, data requirements, and methodological aspects, {eid: 85108446797}>, <Econometric methods for program evaluation, {eid: 85051141133}>, <Synthetic control methods for comparative case studies: Estimating the effect of California’s tobacco control program, {eid: 78649343503}>, <The economic costs of conflict: A case study of the Basque country, {eid: 0742303353}>, <None, {eid: 85097839690}>, <mRSC: Multi-dimensional robust synthetic control, {eid: 85069153562}>, <Robust synthetic control, {eid: 85052951377}>, <Matrix completion methods for causal panel data models, {eid: 85144284927}>, <Layer normalization, {eid: 85039174342}>, <A neural probabilistic language model, {eid: 0142166851}>, <None, {eid: 85136507119}>, <Did the 2007 legal Arizona workers act reduce the state’s unauthorized immigrant population?, {eid: 84900819607}>, <Calcitriol increases frataxin levels and restores mitochondrial function in cell models of Friedreich ataxia, {eid: 85099982859}>, <Language models are few-shot learners, {eid: 85097610606}>, <The impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami labor market, {eid: 84935656104}>, <None, {eid: 0039215916}>, <Decriminalizing Indoor prostitution: Implications for sexual violence and public health, {eid: 85050741625}>, <BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, {eid: 85083815650}>, <An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale, {eid: 85150208907}>, <Balancing, regression, difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods: A synthesis, {eid: 85144333237}>, <How is disease progress in Friedreich’s ataxia best measured?

Based on this relationship, we formulate the data-driven IO problem as a computationally feasible single-level optimization problem. The solution of the data-driven model is based on the gradient descent method, which provides an error bound on the optimal solution and a sub-linear convergence rate. We also rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of the global optimum to the proposed data-driven IO problem and analyze its robustness in two possible noisy settings.

The research proposed two experiments using artificial intelligence and deep learning to demonstrate the problems and solutions regarding methods in manufacturing and factory facilities, respectively. In the first experiment, a Bayesian network inference is used to find the cause of the problem of metal residues between electronic circuits through key process and quality correlations. In the second experiment, a convolutional neural network is used to identify false defects that were overinspected during automatic optical inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing the yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study built in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an Internet of Things setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference.

This method initially combines GPS positioning information with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless communication technology positioning information through smoothing processing, enabling seamless switching between the two positioning methods. Subsequently, a UAV equipped with a telephoto camera is employed for autonomous omnidirectional flight and data collection over the bridge. Finally, the collected data is processed using the StyleGAN2 (Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network) model to generate a larger quantity of finely distributed images of small cracks, which are then recognized in real time using the YOLOv3 neural network algorithm. The proposed method is tested on the Longtanhe Extra-Large Bridge segment of the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway mainline in Hubei, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves accurate UAV positioning in situations where GPS signals are obstructed, but also effectively identifies small cracks on the bridge surface in complex backgrounds, with a crack recall rate of 90% and an improved crack recognition rate of 95%. The methodology presented in this paper provides a scientific and precise basis for the safe operation and maintenance of bridges, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional bridge inspection methods. It offers a new direction for the development of intelligent bridge inspection techniques, bridging the gap between conventional methods and intelligent approaches.","Bridge Engineering, Crack Recognition, Data Augmentation, Defect Detection, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), UWB Positioning Technology",,,,,,,,"<Application of drones in bridge detection J, {eid: 85191346218}>, <None, {eid: 85191337011}>, <UAV altitude measurement system based on barometric pressure sensor C, {eid: 85191357161}>, <Analysis of indoor positioning technology J, {eid: 85191291390}>, <A wireless LAN-based indoor positioning technology J, {eid: 10644263665}>, <None, {eid: 85191297115}>, <UAV pose estimation based on monocular vision based on artificial signs J, {eid: 85191296089}>, <None, {eid: 85191330038}>, <None, {eid: 85191290164}>, <UWB-based Local Positioning System: From a small-scale experimental platform to a large-scale deployable system C, {eid: 78650725602}>, <The effect of cooperation on UWB-based positioning systems using experimental data J, {eid: 43949093096}>, <None, {eid: 85191314255}>, <Design based on UWB indoor positioning hexacopter UAV J, {eid: 85191313319}>, <Research on automatic detection and identification of key problems of pavement cracks based on image processing J, {eid: 85191288518}>, <Novel approach to pavement cracking detection based on morphology and mutual information C, {eid: 77955397982}>, <Pavement crack detection algorithm based on sub-regional multi-scale analysis J, {eid: 84902507740}>, <None, {eid: 85099217399}>, <Research on pavement crack recognition based on deep learning framework Caffe J, {eid: 85191335818}>, <Deep Learning-Based Crack Damage Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks J, {eid: 85017098035}>, <An improved pavement crack identification method based on Mask R-CNN model J/OL, {eid: 85163170694, doi: 10.13203/j.whugis20210279}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-10-27,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85191327322

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Autopilot systems are typically composed of an “inner loop” providing stability and control, whereas an “outer loop” is responsible for mission-level objectives, such as way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are predominately implemented using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However, more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL), which has had success in other applications, such as robotics. Yet previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with state-of-the-art RL algorithms-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Proximal Policy Optimization. To investigate these unknowns, we first developed an open source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then used our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control.","Adaptive control, Attitude control, Autopilot, Intelligent control, Machine learning, PID, Quadcopter, Reinforcement learning, UAV",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075488605}>, <None, {eid: 85075489380}>, <None, {eid: 85075489620}>, <None, {eid: 85075488392}>, <None, {eid: 85048769167}>, <An application of reinforcement learning to aerobatic helicopter flight, {eid: 84864030941}>, <Autonomous helicopter control using reinforcement learning policy search methods, {eid: 0034859944}>, <Learning bounds for domain adaptation, {eid: 85161961443}>, <Hybrid parallel neuro-controller for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle, {eid: 85006833570}>, <Design and control of an indoor micro quadrotor, {eid: 3042681632}>, <None, {eid: 85015444377}>, <Reinforcement learning and the reward engineering principle, {eid: 85048232151}>, <None, {eid: 85050596935}>, <Output feedback control of a quadrotor UAV using neural networks, {eid: 73949156625}>, <An adaptive neuro PID for controlling the altitude of quadcopter robot, {eid: 84893506475}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>, <L1 adaptive control for safety-critical systems, {eid: 84859795434}>, <Control of a quadrotor with reinforcement learning, {eid: 85063310391}>, <Noise and the reality gap: The use of simulation in evolutionary robotics, {eid: 84957806813}>, <None, {eid: 85035223226}>, <Autonomous helicopter flight via reinforcement learning, {eid: 3042583887}>, <None, {eid: 85075487983}>, <Design and use paradigms for Gazebo, an open-source multi-robot simulator, {eid: 14044257268}>, <Intelligent control approaches for aircraft applications, {eid: 78049233640}>, <Feedback linearization vs. Adaptive sliding mode control for a quadrotor helicopter, {eid: 67949092981}>, <Survey of gain-scheduling analysis and design, {eid: 0034691912}>, <None, {eid: 84965135289}>, <Backstepping control for a quadrotor helicopter, {eid: 34250645268}>, <A reliable system design for nondeterministic adaptive controllers in small UAV autopilots, {eid: 85009454818}>, <Evolving mobile robots in simulated and real environments, {eid: 0029311877}>, <None, {eid: 84904867557}>, <State-of-the-art intelligent flight control systems in unmanned aerial vehicles, {eid: 85011977596}>, <Trust region policy optimization, {eid: 84969963490}>, <None, {eid: 85041194636}>, <Robust neuro-control for a micro quadrotor, {eid: 77955877054}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Fundamental limitations and differences of robust and adaptive control, {eid: 0034853976}>, <Multi-agent quadrotor testbed control design: Integral sliding mode vs. Reinforcement learning, {eid: 79957982726}>, <None, {eid: 85075490402}>, <Flight test implementation of a second generation intelligent flight control system, {eid: 77951694302}>, <Optimum settings for automatic controllers, {eid: 0000756319}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-02-01,,eng,Journal,2-s2.0-85071868213

Due to the rapid progress in hardware as well as software technology, the range of applications of CPS is ever increasing. Despite the potential of simulation technology, there are several distinct challenges arising when simulating CPS, which mostly stem from their heterogeneity. In this paper, we present an approach to modeling and simulation of CPS that embraces this heterogeneity by integrating component models realized in domain-specific simulation tools in a cosimulation framework using a flexible plugin system. The framework includes an active simulation database that is used for modeling and communication, and a DE scheduler to orchestrate the co-simulation scenario. The approach is applied to a modular spacecraft where computational hardware is emulated and computer networks are simulated.

In contrast to long design processes, low product variability (one-fits-all), and highly rigid systems, modern pharma players are answering the question: can we bring design and process control up to the speed that novel production technologies give us to quickly set up a flexible production run?

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Design-Time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed. However, experts' assumptions made at design-Time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT). Therefore, experts' design-Time decisions can be challenged at run-Time. A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses and intertwines design-Time and run-Time decisions is thus necessary. This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation. The approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture. This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture. We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions. A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach. We also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.","Continuous

Our work addresses the topic of brokering external data into an Functional Mock-up Interface 2.0 enabled co-simulation via a Functional Mock-up Unit (a simulation unit) called RabbitMQ FMU and an external message queue. Our contribution includes a formal specification that captures the semantics of RabbitMQ FMU and ensures a maximum delay on the messages relayed to the co-simulation even through an unreliable network. This formal specification is used to generate test cases that exercise all states and transitions. The implementation is subjected to these test cases to verify that it is a refinement of the specification. The verification is ongoing and the implementation has successfully been subjected to 1,539,246 tests.","Co-Simulation, Digital Twins, Formal Verification, Functional Mock-up Interface, Self-Adaptive systems",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 51949106265}>, <None, {eid: 84871289819}>, <FMI-Based Distributed Multi-Simulation with DACCOSIM, {eid: 84963663006}>, <FDR3 — A Modern Refinement Checker for CSP, {eid: 84900526515}>, <Co-simulation: a Survey, {eid: 85051436184}>, <None, {eid: 85058571225}>, <A Survey of Recent Results in Networked Control Systems, {eid: 64149124758}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <None, {eid: 0042194883}>, <Automatic Refinement Checking for B, {eid: 33646762492}>, <A Survey on Model-Based Testing Tools for Test Case Generation, {eid: 85040249707}>, <A survey on OPC and OPC-UA: About the standard, developments and investigations, {eid: 84893413640}>, <Maestro: The INTO-CPS Co-simulation Framework, {eid: 85059596452}>, <None, {eid: 85080415350}>, <None, {eid: 84928170648}>, <Virtual engineering at work: the challenges for designing mechatronic products, {eid: 84879306895}>, <None, {eid: 85083286693}>, <Software Engineering of Self-adaptive Systems, {eid: 85083949468}>, <An application framework of digital twin and its case study, {eid: 85049576881}>, <A Comprehensive Technological Survey on the Dependable Self-Management CPS: From Self-Adaptive Architecture to Self-Management Strategies, {eid: 85062434711}>",,,The Society for Modeling and Simulation International,,,2020-07-20,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85099278177

However, authoring CAPs accurately and avoiding run-time errors is challenging for end-users as it is difficult to foresee CAP behaviors under complex real-world conditions. We propose Fast-Forward Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) based authoring workflow that enables end-users to iteratively author and refine CAPs by validating their behaviors via simulated unit test cases. We develop a computational approach to automatically generate test cases based on the authored CAP and the user's context history. Our system delivers each test case with immersive visualizations in XR, facilitating users to verify the CAP behavior and identify necessary refinements. We evaluated Fast-Forward Reality in a user study (N=12). Our authoring and validation process improved the accuracy of CAPs and the users provided positive feedback on the system usability.","Context-Aware Policy, Extended Reality, Unit Test, Validation",,,,,,,,"<Towards a better understanding of context and context-awareness, {eid: 84957621961}>, <Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, {eid: 0027621699}>, <None, {eid: 85194860853}>, <Towards improving trust in context-aware systems by displaying system confidence, {eid: 77953745112}>, <Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, {eid: 85077515399}>, <Deictic codes for the embodiment of cognition, {eid: 0031429913}>, <Using pointing and describing to achieve joint focus of attention in dialogue, {eid: 2942691786}>, <Intelligibility and Accountability: Human Considerations in Context-Aware Systems, {eid: 0035569004}>, <Smart medicine reminder box, {eid: 85058379515}>, <IoT wearable sensor and deep learning: An integrated approach for personalized human activity recognition in a smart home environment, {eid: 85073436814}>, <Accuracy of daily fluid intake measurements using a “smart” water bottle, {eid: 85030535036}>, <An exploratory study of augmented reality presence for tutoring machine tasks, {eid: 85091310283}>, <GhostAR: A time-space editor for embodied authoring of human-robot collaborative task with augmented reality, {eid: 85074845669}>, <Realtime multiperson 2d pose estimation using part affinity fields, {eid: 85022330947}>, <SeCoMan: A semantic-aware policy framework for developing privacy-preserving and context-aware smart applications, {eid: 84892769735}>, <Smart advisor: Real-time information provider with mobile augmented reality, {eid: 84965153594}>, <Interaction models for multiple-resident activity recognition in a smart home, {eid: 78651500231}>, <ARticulate: One-Shot Interactions with Intelligent Assistants in Unfamiliar Smart Spaces Using Augmented Reality, {eid: 85127907640}>, <Design principles for intelligent environments, {eid: 38549100814}>, <Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset, {eid: 85148988638}>, <Test case design for context-aware applications: Are we there yet?, {eid: 85016195256}>, <The semantic web: The roles of XML and RDF, {eid: 0034273774}>, <Understanding and using context, {eid: 84900830868}>, <A conceptual framework and a toolkit for supporting the rapid prototyping of context-aware applications, {eid: 0035568918}>, <a CAPpella: programming by demonstration of context-aware applications, {eid: 4544277995}>, <iCAP: Interactive prototyping of context-aware applications, {eid: 33745920192}>, <But How, Donald, Tell Us How?

Manual dimensional measurement using standard gauges can only be applied on a few datums. To measure a huge number of datums, a component needs to be scanned into a point cloud and measured digitally. For precision components, datum generation on the scanned point cloud is labor-intensive. Given a raw point cloud from scanner, this paper proposes an automatic dimensional measurement solution with an adaptive local registration algorithm and an adaptive datum generation algorithm. Using datums on the CAD model as reference, the adaptive local registration algorithm selects local regions on the scanned model to compensate the local deviation between the CAD model and the scanned model. After that, with outliers and noises in the raw data, the adaptive datum generation algorithm creates the correct datums on the scanned model adaptive to the actual geometry. Dimensional measurement based on the generated datums can be achieved automatically. Moreover, the solution does not require users to manually preprocess the point cloud, such as outlier and noise removal. As such, it improves the productivity in dimensional inspection.","Datum generation, Dimensional measurement, Inspection",,,,,,,,"<A dimensioning and tolerancing assistance model for CAD/CAM systems, {eid: 0028672123}>, <CAD-based environment to bridge the gap between product design and tolerance control, {eid: 70350115244}>, <Datum identification for tolerances control on dense clouds of points, {eid: 70350089503}>, <None, {eid: 85081083879}>, <Simulated and experimental verification of CMM feature fitting algorithms, {eid: 84979067031}>, <Reconciling the differences between tolerance specification and measurement methods, {eid: 84890280211}>, <Standardization of CMM fitting algorithms and development of inspection maps for use in statistical process control, {eid: 82455166871}>, <None, {eid: 85081078337}>, <None, {eid: 85081090535}>, <None, {eid: 85081089466}>, <None, {eid: 85078524121}>, <None, {eid: 85081079948}>, <Calibration technology in application of robot-laser scanning system, {eid: 84889592547}>, <A noise-tolerant algorithm for robot-sensor calibration using a planar disk of arbitrary 3-D orientation, {eid: 85081081603}>, <None, {eid: 85081090337}>, <None, {eid: 85081081716}>, <None, {eid: 85055683292}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-11-22,,eng,Conference Proceeding,2-s2.0-85081090364

However, the existing spectrum sharing strategies cannot support the operation of access points in moving vehicles such as cars and UAVs. This is primarily because of the directionality-based spectrum sharing among the incumbent systems in this band and the high mobility of the moving vehicles, which together make it challenging to control the cross-system interference. In this paper, we propose SwarmShare, a mobility-resilient spectrum sharing framework for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band. We first present a mathematical formulation of the SwarmShare problem, where the objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of the UAV network by jointly controlling the flight and transmission power of the UAVs and their association with the ground users, under the interference constraints of the incumbent system. We find that there are no closed-form mathematical models that can be used to characterize the statistical behaviors of the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system. Then we propose a data-driven three-phase spectrum sharing approach, including Initial Power Enforcement, Offline-dataset Guided Online Power Adaptation, and Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Optimization. We validate the effectiveness of SwarmShare through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that, based on SwarmShare, the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system can be effectively kept below the target level without requiring the real-time cross-system channel state information. The mobility resilience of SwarmShare is also validated in coexisting networks with no precise UAV location information.","6 GHz, Spectrum sharing, swarm UAVs",,,,,,,,"<SwarmShare: Mobility-resilient spectrum sharing for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band, {eid: 85111728904}>, <UAV assisted spectrum sharing ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, {eid: 85081974098}>, <3D spectrum sharing for hybrid D2D and UAV networks, {eid: 85091839298}>, <UAV-aided vehicular communication design with vehicle trajectorys prediction, {eid: 85101828683}>, <Adaptive deployment for UAV-aided communication networks, {eid: 85072188475}>, <Joint optimisation of real-time deployment and resource allocation for UAV-aided disaster emergency communications, {eid: 85112179683}>, <None, {eid: 85073028910}>, <Standardization advances for cellular and Wi-Fi coexistence in the unlicensed 5 and 6 GHz bands, {eid: 85097846829}>, <UAV-assisted emergency communications in social IoT: A dynamic hypergraph coloring approach, {eid: 85089957124}>, <Spectrum sharing and cyclical multiple access in UAV-aided cellular offloading, {eid: 85042007436}>, <Spectrum sharing planning for full-duplex UAV relaying systems with underlaid D2D communications, {eid: 85052581549}>, <Learning-aided realtime performance optimisation of cognitive UAV-assisted disaster communication, {eid: 85077674371}>, <Secrecy performance analysis of UAV assisted relay transmission for cognitive network with energy harvesting, {eid: 85088536718}>, <Survey on UAV cellular communications: Practical aspects, standardization advancements, regulation, and security challenges, {eid: 85076372548}>, <Cognition in UAV-aided 5G and beyond communications: A survey, {eid: 85078430311}>, <Robust trajectory and transmit power optimization for secure UAV-enabled cognitive radio networks, {eid: 85088538481}>, <Joint admission and power control for cognitive radio cellular networks, {eid: 62949187590}>, <Cognitive backscatter network: A spectrum sharing paradigm for passive IoT, {eid: 85073690241}>, <A practical spectrum sharing scheme for cognitive radio networks: Design and experiments, {eid: 85090797084}>, <Power control based on deep reinforcement learning for spectrum sharing, {eid: 85086502513}>, <Accelerating model-free reinforcement learning with imperfect model knowledge in dynamic spectrum access, {eid: 85089942150}>, <A stochastic optimization approach for spectrum sharing of radar and LTE systems, {eid: 85065961372}>, <RadChat: Spectrum sharing for automotive radar interference mitigation, {eid: 85077267152}>, <Joint radar and communication system optimization for spectrum sharing, {eid: 85073106798}>, <Spatial spectrum sharing for satellite and terrestrial communication networks, {eid: 85067131666}>, <A survey of mmWave user association mechanisms and spectrum sharing approaches: An overview, open issues and challenges, future research trends, {eid: 85063219417}>, <Survey on spectrum sharing/allocation for cognitive radio networks Internet of Things, {eid: 85081258015}>, <An edgecomputing based architecture for mobile augmented reality, {eid: 85060317456}>, <Multi-agent reinforcement learningbased resource allocation for UAV networks, {eid: 85079784199}>, <FlyTera: Echo state learning for joint access and flight control in THz-enabled drone networks, {eid: 85091960641}>, <CoBeam: Beamforming-based spectrum sharing with zero cross-technology signaling for 5G wireless networks, {eid: 85090283212}>, <Resource allocation for optimizing energy efficiency in NOMA-based fog UAV wireless networks, {eid: 85083073260}>, <Breaking the curse of dimensionality using decompositions of incomplete tensors: Tensor-based scientific computing in big data analysis, {eid: 85032751253}>, <Novel representations for the equicorrelated multivariate non-central chi-square distribution and applications to MIMO systems in correlated Rician fading, {eid: 80052956377}>, <Aggregate interference analysis for underlay cognitive radio networks, {eid: 84871069289}>, <Effect of user mobility and channel fading on the outage performance of UAV communications, {eid: 85081536794}>, <Linear regression and the normality assumption, {eid: 85041625077}>, <Beam learning in mmWave/THz-band drone networks under in-flight mobility uncertainties, {eid: 85130638947}>, <Optimal 3D UAV base station placement by considering autonomous coverage hole detection, wireless backhaul and user demand, {eid: 85110305184}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <None, {eid: 84977601395}>, <None, {eid: 85180917917}>, <To transmit or not to transmit?

In workplaces where such display rules exist, workers experience an emotional workload. Continued exposure to emotional workload can lead to severe mental and psychological issues. Nevertheless, research on assessing emotional workload remains understudied. In this study, we propose a machine learning model to automatically evaluate workers’ emotional workload in emotional labor situations through multimodal sensing. The data collection study was designed based on a call center scenario. Within the study, we manipulated customer behaviors as confederates and assessed the worker’s emotional workload. As a result, this study provides a benchmark using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. We achieved an accuracy of up to 87% for binary and three-class classification cases. Finally, we discuss the significance of assessing emotional workload and considerations for its practical application in the workplace.","Emotion Regulation, Emotional Workload, Multimodal Sensing",,,,,,,,"<Natural affect data—Collection & annotation in a learning context, {eid: 77949408526}>, <Speech emotion recognition: Emotional models, databases, features, preprocessing methods, supporting modalities, and classifiers, {eid: 85076679231}>, <The Platform as Factory: Crowdwork and the Hidden Labour Behind Artificial Intelligence, {eid: 85078204268}>, <Social psychological methods of emotion elicitation, {eid: 34250337526}>, <Estimating pilots’ cognitive load from ocular parameters through simulation and in-flight studies, {eid: 85073996209}>, <Emotional intensity: Measurement and theoretical implications, {eid: 0000208292}>, <Linear discriminant analysis-a brief tutorial, {eid: 84887493447}>, <Historical pitfalls and new directions in the neuroscience of emotion, {eid: 85028637457}>, <Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource?, {eid: 0032063793}>, <The strength model of self-control, {eid: 36348998050}>, <Episodic intrapersonal emotion regulation: Or, dealing with life as it happens, {eid: 85061309419}>, <Women, social skill and interactive service work in telephone call centres, {eid: 0036190476}>, <A review, current challenges, and future possibilities on emotion recognition using machine learning and physiological signals, {eid: 85077742997}>, <Random forests, {eid: 0035478854}>, <Xgboost: extreme gradient boosting, {eid: 84964778324}>, <Combined exposure of emotional labor and job insecurity on depressive symptoms among female call-center workers: A cross-sectional study, {eid: 85063645350}>, <Rethinking eye-blink: Assessing task difficulty through physiological representation of spontaneous blinking, {eid: 85106704054}>, <The use of pilot rating in the evaluation of aircraft handling qualities, {eid: 0003273227}>, <A social interaction model of the effects of emotion regulation on work strain, {eid: 22544447360}>, <Affective style and affective disorders: Perspectives from affective neuroscience, {eid: 0013177471}>, <A multi-sensor approach to automatically recognize breaks and work activities of knowledge workers in academia, {eid: 85092428825}>, <Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective, {eid: 0344585434}>, <Not all emotional display rules are created equal: Distinguishing between prescriptive and contextual display rules, {eid: 77955670472}>, <None, {eid: 0003472470}>, <Can we ditch feature engineering?

To help fill this gap, we propose OccSim, a system that automatically generates occupancy behaviours in a 3D model of a building and helps users analyze the potential effect of virus transmission from a large-scale and longitudinal perspective. Our participatory evaluation with four groups of stakeholders revealed that OccSim could enhance their decision making processes by identifying specific risks of virus transmission in advance, and illuminating how each risk relates to complex human-building interactions.

They do so through machine learning (ML) models built using data from sensors fitted in the plant. Over time, environmental factors cause variations in sensor readings, adversely affecting quality of the models' predictions. This triggers the self-learning loop, leading to the re-tuning/re-training of models. Reducing the time spent in self-learning of the models is a challenging task since there exist multiple models that need to be trained repeatedly using multiple algorithms which translates into large training time. We propose a metalearner which recommends the optimal regression algorithm for a model, thereby eliminating the need for training the model on multiple algorithms for every self-learning instance. The metalearner is trained on metafeatures extracted from the data which makes it application agnostic. We introduce domain metafeatures, which enhance metalearner prediction accuracy and propose machine learning and deep learning based approaches for selecting optimal metafeatures. To ensure relevance of selected metafeatures, we introduce novel static and dynamic reward functions for dynamic metafeature selection using a Q-Learning based approach. Our metalearning approach accelerates the time for determining the optimal regressor among 5 potential regressors from 5X to 27X over the traditional self-learning approaches.

The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-To-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.","Business Process Management, Digital Transformation, Digitization, Manufacturing, Product Development, Transformation",,,,,,,,"<Reflections on societal and business model transformation arising from digitization and big data analytics: A research agenda, {eid: 84941599511}>, <Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, {eid: 84876819524}>, <What does a chief digital officer do?

All rights reserved.In an in-situ workflow, multiple components such as simulation and analysis applications are coupled with streaming data transfers the multiplicity of possible configurations necessitates an auto-Tuner for workflow optimization. Existing auto-Tuning approaches are computationally expensive because many configurations must be sampled by running the whole workflow repeatedly in order to train the autotuner surrogate model or otherwise explore the configuration space. To reduce these costs, we instead combine the performance models of component applications by exploiting the analytical workflow structure, selectively generating test configurations to measure and guide the training of a machine learning workflow surrogate model. Because the training can focus on well-performing configurations, the resulting surrogate model can achieve high prediction accuracy for good configurations despite training with fewer total configurations. Experiments with real applications demonstrate that our approach can identify significantly better configurations than other approaches for a fixed computer time budget.","Auto-Tuning, Bootstrapping, Component model combination, In-situ workflow",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85120007552}>, <Compiler Techniques for Massively Scalable Implicit Task Parallelism, {eid: 84936944806}>, <Performance Analysis, Design Considerations, and Applications of Extreme-scale in situ Infrastructures, {eid: 85017273543}>, <2018 Autotuning in Highperformance Computing Applications, {eid: 85050754660}>, <Activelearning-based surrogate models for empirical performance tuning.

Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a key technology capable of intelligently reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, thereby enhancing overall network performance. Traditional optimization techniques face limitations in meeting the stringent performance requirements of 6G networks due to the intricate and dynamic nature of the wireless environment. Consequently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed within the IRS framework to optimize wireless system performance. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest research in DL-aided IRS models, covering optimal beamforming, resource allocation control, channel estimation and prediction, signal detection, and system deployment. The focus is on presenting promising solutions within the constraints of different hardware configurations. The survey explores challenges, opportunities, and open research issues in DL-aided IRS, considering emerging technologies such as digital twins (DTs), computer vision (CV), blockchain, network function virtualization (NFC), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), software-defined networking (SDN), mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Practical design issues associated with these enabling technologies are also discussed, providing valuable insights into the current state and future directions of this evolving field.","intelligent reflecting surface, deep reinforcement learning, 6g, channel estimation, resource allocation, optimization",,,,,,,,None,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2024-09-01,,,,

Evolving from MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within federated learning (FL) settings, which empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client. Nevertheless, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges necessitate a tailored design when developing FU algorithms. While various concepts and numerous federated unlearning schemes exist in this field, the unified workflow and tailored design of FU are not yet well understood. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques and methodologies in FU providing an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluating existing federated unlearning algorithms, and reviewing optimizations tailored to federated learning. Additionally, it discusses practical applications and assesses their limitations.

Its main ingredient is to cooperatively learn the model among the distributed clients without uploading any sensitive data. In this paper, we conducted a thorough review of the related works, following the development context and deeply mining the key technologies behind FL from the perspectives of theory and application. Specifically, we first classify the existing works in FL architecture based on the network topology of FL systems with detailed analysis and summarization. Next, we abstract the current application problems, summarize the general techniques and frame the application problems into the general paradigm of FL base models. Moreover, we provide our proposed solutions for model training via FL. We have summarized and analyzed the existing FedOpt algorithms, and deeply revealed the algorithmic development principles of many first-order algorithms in depth, proposing a more generalized algorithm design framework. With the instantiation of these frameworks, FedOpt algorithms can be simply developed. As privacy and security is the fundamental requirement in FL, we provide the existing attack scenarios and the defense methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first tier to review the theoretical methodology and propose our strategies since there are very few works surveying the theoretical approaches.

"GROENEWEGEN, MAT, DEJONG, T",SYNTHETIC AGB EVOLUTION .4. LONG-PERIOD VARIABLES IN THE LMC,1994,ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS,,,,,,"From observations of LPVs (long period variables) in the LMC we derive
that the ratio of the number of C-rich LPVs to the total number of
carbon stars is approximately 0.05 and that the ratio of the number of
oxygen-rich LPVs to the total number of oxygen-rich AGB stars is between
0.05 and 0.10. The lifetime of the LPV phase in the LMC is only a few
10(4) yr, considerable below estimates for the Galaxy, where the
duration of the LPV phase (about 2 10(5) yr) is similar to the total AGB
lifetime. If the possible incompleteness of the surveys for LPVs is
invoked to explain this discrepancy in the lifetimes then the ratio of
small amplitude variables to large amplitude variables must be about 30,
considerably larger than the ratio of Semi Regular to Mira variables in
the Galaxy (1-3).
We present a simple model to explain the observed properties of LPVs in
the LMC. It is assumed that pulsation only occurs in an instability
strip in the HR diagram. The instability strip is characterised by three
parameters: the temperature at some reference luminosity, the width of
the instability strip and its slope dT(eff)/dM(bol). The first two are
free parameters in the model. Based on observations we use
dT(eff)/dM(bol) = 275 K mag-1 for M(bol) > -5 and 100 K mag-1 for M(bol)
< -5. An additional complication is that the pulsation period depends
rather sensitively on the effective temperature scale. The location of
the AGB tracks in the HR diagram (the zero point of the effective
temperature scale) is the third free parameter.
Both a model with a Reimers mass loss law inside and outside the
instability strip, and a model with the mass loss in the instability
strip given by a scaled version of the Blocker & Schonberner (1993)
mass loss law, fit the observational constraints equally well.
We conclude that first harmonic pulsation can be excluded unless the
canonical relation between (J - K) color and effective temperature
(based on lunar occultation observations) gives temperatures which are
too high by approximately 20%, much larger than the estimated
uncertainty of approximately 8% or possible systematic effects
(less-than-or-similar-to 10%). Fundamental mode pulsation is therefore
probably the dominant pulsation mode among LPVs in the LMC.
A second conclusion is that for most stars the instability strip is not
the final phase of AGB evolution. Based on our calculations for
individual stars we find that AGB stars more massive than about 1.2M.
spend a considerable amount of time in the phase between the end of
pulsation and the end of the AGB.
We propose an alternative explanation for (some of) the non-variable
OH/IR stars in the Galaxy.","stars, evolution of, stars, agb, stars, variables, others, magellanic, clouds",,,,,,,,None,,,EDP SCIENCES S A,,,1994-08-01,,English,,

By that, the existing gap between theoretical foundations and implementation in practical use is intended to be closed through providing practitioners insights to relevant approaches. Apart from that, researchers are enabled to derive new research directions from the corpus of literature. Relevant reports use different diagrams to model a decision situation or its processes and reuse those diagrams as well as their contents to feed methods from multicriteria decision-making. By that, new objectives are added to those diagrams, namely to enable extensive decision-making, which is understood as their utilization. Thus, this article provides an overview of applied decision-making approaches, languages used to model the decision context, and the use of external tools, where the decision-making algorithms are executed. The findings show that the majority of existing approaches only cover certain aspects of the decision-making situation in the system model and especially the formalization of the decision-making process is hardly considered.

With developing Internet of Things (IoT), edge/cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), another new paradigm - Digital Twin (DT), as an enabler for realizing the Metaverse of CPS has emerged recently. The DT provides a virtual replica of the physical world, allowing for real-time monitoring, control, and analysis of safety-critical systems like the CPS. Even though many CPS-related problems can be addressed using DT concepts, it is critical to define DT’s integration clearly to leverage its features to the best possible extent. This paper introduces a new layer called the data layer in the CPS layer architecture to support different DT functionalities. Like the layer and abstract design paradigm of modern operation systems and computer networks, the data layer serves as an abstraction layer, providing immense flexibility and interchangeability of various data sources, supporting applications, and adapting to other components and environments. This also accelerates the growth of smart-world systems and their integration in different application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart cities, smart healthcare, etc.). To this end, this paper presents a new data layer structure to support CPS applications and the integration of multiple CPS. We propose a hierarchical architecture to synthesize DT techniques as an independent layer in our architecture, deeply integrated into existing CPS. We discuss key issues: leveraging the data layer to support applications in various CPS, incorporating the data layer and physical layer, and building a data layer using distributed computing, naming services, etc. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions based on the presented new data layer architecture for CPS.","cps, digital twins, machine learning, metaverse",,,,,,,,None,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2024-06-01,,,,
