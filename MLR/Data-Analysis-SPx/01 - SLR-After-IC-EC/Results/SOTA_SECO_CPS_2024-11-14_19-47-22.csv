Battery state of health estimation is essential for optimizing the battery usage, performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles. Estimating the state of health of a battery is a complex undertaking due to its dependency on multiple factors. These factors include battery characteristics such as type, chemistry, size, temperature, current, voltage, impedance, cycle number, and driving pattern. There are drawbacks to traditional methods, such as experimental and model-based approaches, in terms of accuracy, complexity, expense, and viability for real-time applications. By employing a variety of algorithms to discover the nonlinear and dynamic link between the battery parameters and the state of health, data-driven techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven digital twin technologies can get beyond these restrictions. Data-driven methods can also incorporate physics and domain knowledge to improve the explainability and interpretability of the results. This paper reviews the latest advancements and challenges of using data-driven techniques for battery state of health estimation and management in electric vehicles. The paper also discusses the future directions and opportunities for further research and development in this field. The survey scope spans publications from the year 2021 to 2023.","battery health prediction, data-driven methods, deep learning models, digital twin technology, electric vehicles, lithium-ion

This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes.","building information modeling, building lifecycle data, building permits, city information model, digital twins, GeoBIM, information model-based urban planning",,,,,,,,"<Automatic rule-based checking of building designs, {eid: 70349429622, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2009.07.002}>, <BIM for public authorities: Basic research for the standardized implementation of BIM in the building permit process, {eid: 85073033386, doi: 10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/012102}>, <None, {eid: 85199664264}>, <A State-of-the-Art Review on the Integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS), {eid: 85014918203, doi: 10.3390/ijgi6020053}>, <From Geotechnical Data to GeoBIM Models: Testing Strategies for an Ex-Industrial Site in Turin, {eid: 85172807488, doi: 10.3390/buildings13092343}>, <BIM- and GIS-Based Life-Cycle-Assessment Framework for Enhancing Eco Efficiency and Sustainability in the Construction Sector, {eid: 85185888364, doi: 10.3390/buildings14020360}>, <An integrated building information modeling (BIM)-based lifecycle-oriented framework for sustainable building design, {eid: 85139162343, doi: 10.1108/CI-02-2021-0011}>, <Asset Information Model Management-Based GIS/BIM Integration in Facility Management Contract, {eid: 85189030595, doi: 10.3390/su16062495}>, <None, {eid: 38649094993}>, <Building Information Modeling: Why?

The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This article reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modeling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS

The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.","automotive, aviation, digital twin, maritime, simulation method",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin in aerospace industry: A gentle introduction, {eid: 85122087744}>, <Digital twin for ship life-cycle: A critical systematic review, {eid: 85145283461}>, <Towards the future of smart electric vehicles: Digital twin technology, {eid: 85101382380}>, <Digital twin applications in aviation industry: A review, {eid: 85135421849}>, <A digital twin of the research vessel Gunnerus for lifecycle services: Outlining key technologies, {eid: 85174368733}>, <From ROM of electrochemistry to AI-based battery digital and hybrid twin, {eid: 85080982468}>, <Towards virtual twin for electronic packages in automotive applications, {eid: 85106914513}>, <Fault diagnosis of intelligent production line based on digital twin and improved random forest, {eid: 85113522726}>, <A detection and configuration method for welding completeness in the automotive body-in-white panel based on digital twin, {eid: 85130029875}>, <Bending waves focusing in arbitrary shaped plate-like structures: Application to spatial audio in cars, {eid: 85089246544}>, <Digital twin modeling of a solar car based on the hybrid model method with data-driven and mechanistic, {eid: 85110697727}>, <DMulti-Vehicle Trajectory Tracking towards Digital Twin Intersections for Internet of Vehicles, {eid: 85146784233}>, <A novel digital twin-centric approach for driver intention prediction and traffic congestion avoidance, {eid: 85062692056}>, <Dedicated adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm for digital twin based control optimization of the plug-in hybrid vehicle, {eid: 85173620198}>, <A digital twin framework for aircraft hydraulic systems failure detection using machine learning techniques, {eid: 85141409916}>, <Towards aircraft maintenance metaverse using speech interactions with virtual objects in mixed reality, {eid: 85102467195}>, <Digital twin-driven aero-engine intelligent predictive maintenance, {eid: 85105375338}>, <Digital twin-driven reconfigurable fixturing optimization for trimming operation of aircraft skins, {eid: 85126658906}>, <Towards a digital twin approach for vessel-specific fatigue damage monitoring and prognosis, {eid: 85120321957}>, <Digital twin-based scheduling method for marine equipment material transportation vehicles, {eid: 85141728319}>, <Digital twin-driven approach for process management and traceability towards ship industry, {eid: 85131543381}>, <Data-driven ship digital twin for estimating the speed loss caused by the marine fouling, {eid: 85067817812}>, <An uncertainty-aware hybrid approach for sea state estimation using ship motion responses, {eid: 85104569548}>, <Incorporating approximate dynamics into data-driven calibrator: A representative model for ship maneuvering prediction, {eid: 85112147169}>, <Holistic digital-twin-based framework to improve tunnel lighting environment: From methodology to application, {eid: 85137170907}>, <Design and simulation of a digital twin mobility concept: An electric aviation system dynamics case study with capacity constraints, {eid: 85122889156}>, <Integrated design and control approach for marine power systems based on operational data digital twin to design, {eid: 85114458059}>, <A digital twin case study on automotive production line, {eid: 85138329747}>, <Needs, requirements and a concept of a tool condition monitoring system for the aerospace industry, {eid: 85111334279}>, <Using digital twin in a shipbuilding project, {eid: 85144848278}>, <Vision-cloud data fusion for ADAS: A lane change prediction case study, {eid: 85135247150}>, <Unsupervised data-preprocessing for long short-term memory based battery model under electric vehicle operation, {eid: 85104663507}>, <Digital twin of a hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle: Effect of the control strategy on energy efficiency, {eid: 85173615614}>, <A physics-based digital twin for model predictive control of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle landing, {eid: 85132312830}>, <Real-time digital twin for ship operation in waves, {eid: 85140273039}>, <Coupling of dynamic reaction forces of a heavy load crane and ship motion responses in waves, {eid: 85104257946}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-08-18,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85173614838

Such interest introduces the concept of Digital Twins in supporting designers and operators through the whole ship-life cycle. However, the term Digital Twin is typically abused in the shipping industry, many times erroneously referring to any virtual version of a model-based system as a Digital Twin of the ship. The mutual data exchange between the physical and virtual environment, which is the basis of a true Digital Twin, is mostly missing, confusing a virtual model with a sophisticated living virtual environment. Few reviews are available in the literature for Digital Twins on ships. This systematic review proposes the identification of weaknesses and correlations between current Digital Twin applications in the maritime industry and other industry fields. Furthermore, the methodology applied here may be repeated in future studies to provide a fair and objective overview of the research advancements in the topic. The study highlighted how literature scarcely addresses the design and decommissioning phases, indicating that research should focus on these topics, especially concerning the design of future ships.","Digital transition, Digital twin, Industry 4.0, Literature review, Ship life-cycle",,,,,,,,"<Reconfiguration of smart product s during their use phase based on virtual product twins, {eid:

Currently, some DTs implementations are taking place. Nevertheless, the whole concept remains ambiguous and presents some differences that need to be addressed. The aim of this article is to bridge the gap between DTs definitions and current implementations. This review was conducted through a scientific literature review and an online survey. The study collects Digital Twins for cities definitions and compares them with related concepts used jointly in the literature. It puts them together through an in-depth analysis since they express similarities and various discrepancies. As our study highlights the most documented DTs initiatives for cities according to 9 comprehensive categories, a new approach assessing the initiatives is proposed to evaluate the data integration methods used in the current realizations. Three levels are suggested: a conceptual schema model-based level (the data are integrated into the top level of the DT, i.e., extending the schema model to cover new features or themes); a database-based level (data are integrated in order to feed or update specific attributes or classes); and an application-based level (the data are integrated into the application generally at the viewer level).","3D city model, City information model, Data integration, Digital twins, Spatial data infrastructure",,,,,,,,"<exploring digital twin adaptation to the urban environment: comparison with CIM to avoid silo-based approaches, {eid: 85132026799, doi: 10.5194/isprs-annals-V-4-2022-337-2022}>, <A Photorealistic 3D City Modeling Framework for Smart City Digital Twin, {eid: 85136104088}>, <Cyber-physical systems improving building energy management: digital twin and artificial intelligence, {eid: 85106177854, doi: 10.3390/en14082338}>, <USE cases for district-scale urban digital twins, {eid: 85140316961, doi: 10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W4-2022-5-2022}>, <None, {eid: 85166980389}>, <Digital twins in the construction industry: a perspective of practitioners and building authority, {eid: 85133498897, doi: 10.3389/fbuil.2022.834671}>, <Smart cities – systems of systems interoperability and OGC enablers, {eid: 85140331362, doi: 10.5194/isprs-annals-X-4-W3-2022-19-2022}>, <Hybrid aerial sensor data as basis for a geospatial digital twin, {eid: 85132139174, doi: 10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B4-2022-653-2022}>, <Digital twins, {eid: 85053693787, doi: 10.1177/2399808318796416}>, <Digital cornucopias: changing conceptions of the virtual city, {eid: 33846209952, doi: 10.1068/b3306ed}>, <Urban Digital Twins – A FIWARE-based model, {eid: 85120727456, doi: 10.1515/auto-2021-0083}>, <Applications of 3D city models: state of the art review, {eid: 84952802912, doi: 10.3390/ijgi4042842}>, <None, {eid: 85008902475}>, <Towards a semantic construction digital twin: directions for future research, {eid: 85082386834, doi: 10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049}>, <Digital twin technology challenges and applications: a comprehensive review, {eid: 85126301082, doi: 10.3390/rs14061335}>, <Digital twin for urban planning in the green deal era: a state of the art and future perspectives, {eid: 85131544176}>, <Urban scale digital twins in data-driven society: challenging digital universalism in urban planning decision-making, {eid: 85122656941, doi: 10.1177/14780771211070005}>, <Securing spatial data infrastructures for distributed smart city applications and services, {eid: 85069588985, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2019.07.002}>, <None, {eid: 85166906891}>, <A SEMANTICALLY ENRICHED AND WEB-BASED 3D ENERGY MODEL VISUALIZATION AND RETRIEVAL FOR SMART BUILDING IMPLEMENTATION USING CITYGML AND DYNAMIZER ADE, {eid: 85094136066}>, <None, {eid: 85166962599}>, <The development of 3D city model and its applications in urban planning, {eid: 80052344284}>, <A standard-based open source IoT platform: FIWARE, {eid: 85086591264, doi: 10.1109/IOTM.0001.1800022}>, <None, {eid: 85056157741}>, <Chapter 14 -

This review aims to provide a quantitative review to analyze specific study contents, research focus, and trends of DT in healthcare. Simultaneously, this review intends to expand the connotation of “healthcare” into two directions, namely “Disease treatment” and “Health enhancement” to analyze the content within the “DT + healthcare” field thoroughly. Methods: A data mining method named Structure Topic Modeling (STM) was used as the analytical tool due to its topic analysis ability and versatility. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure supplied the material papers in this review. Results: A total of 94 high-quality papers published between 2018 and 2022 were gathered and categorized into eight topics, collectively covering the transformative impact across a broader spectrum in healthcare. Three main findings have emerged: (1) papers published in healthcare predominantly concentrate on technology development (artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc.) and application scenarios(personalized, precise, and real-time health service); (2) the popularity of research topics is influenced by various factors, including policies, COVID-19, and emerging technologies; and (3) the preference for topics is diverse, with a general inclination toward the attribute of “Health enhancement.” Conclusions: This review underscores the significance of real-time capability and accuracy in shaping the future of DT, where algorithms and data transmission methods assume central importance in achieving these goals. Moreover, technological advancements, such as omics and Metaverse, have opened up new possibilities for DT in healthcare. These findings contribute to the existing literature by offering quantitative insights and valuable guidance to keep researchers ahead of the curve.","artificial intelligence, digital twin, Healthcare, structure topic modeling, text data mining",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4.0 in healthcare: A systematic review, {eid: 85129949636}>, <Healthcare 4.0: trends, challenges and research directions, {eid: 85076883318}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 85174225297}>, <None, {eid: 85174267280}>, <None, {eid: 85174285417}>, <None, {eid: 85046337978}>, <Knowledge-based systems digital twin-assisted Blockchain-inspired irregular event analysis for eldercare, {eid: 85143547493}>, <Digital twins in healthcare: an architectural proposal and its application in a social distancing case study, {eid: 85137900898}>, <None, {eid: 85145508570}>, <Biomedical technology exploring the revolution in healthcare systems through the applications of digital twin technology, {eid: 85169073557}>, <The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews, {eid: 85103451714}>, <Suitability of google scholar as a source of scientific information and as a source of data for scientific evaluation—review of the literature, {eid: 85021624027}>, <The role of google scholar in evidence reviews and its applicability to grey literature searching.

The aim is to understand what have been the use cases, modelling and simulation tools/techniques, and how security is being addressed. To answer these research questions, a rigorous methodology consisting of seven steps was followed. The analysis shows that there is a misconception regarding the digital twin concept that may be leading to its misuse. Moreover, it was found that security is not a top priority, but is often mentioned as a challenge. Besides the lack of standardization, the amount of academic papers published and industrial solutions offered is increasing, showing that the consensus is not a limiting factor and the concept is gaining popularity over the years and being applied in an increasing number of sectors, mainly on manufacturing, energy, aerospace and automotive.","architecture, digital twin, framework, security",,,,,,,,"<Digital Twins bonds society with cyber-physical Energy Systems: A literature review, {eid: 85127452658}>, <A Survey on Digital Twin: Definitions, Characteristics, Applications, and Design Implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <None, {eid: 85169689136}>, <None, {eid: 0003867065}>, <Digital Twin: Enabling Technologies, Challenges and Open Research, {eid: 85087331367}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future NASA and US Air Force vehicles, {eid: 84881388851}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 85169694605}>, <None, {eid: 85169699185}>, <None, {eid: 85169685014}>, <None, {eid: 85169676874}>, <None, {eid: 85169687148}>, <What is the different between model, architecture, framework, and protocol in computer science, {eid: 85169699199}>, <None, {eid: 85032274754}>, <Characterising the Digital Twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Reference Framework for Digital Twins within Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85072842816}>, <Industrial Network Security: Securing critical infrastructure networks for smart grid, SCADA, and other Industrial Control Systems, {eid: 84962298310}>, <Digital Twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital Twin: Finding Common Ground-A Meta-Review, {eid: 85121621632}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875}>, <Digital Twin for Verification and Validation of Industrial Automation Systems-a Survey, {eid: 85093362017}>, <Digital Twin Models in Industrial Operations: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85084241025}>, <Digital Twins From Smart Manufacturing to Smart Cities: A Survey, {eid: 85117842563}>, <A Review of the Roles of Digital Twin in CPS-based Production Systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <A guide to conducting a standalone systematic literature review, {eid: 84948736579}>, <Enablers and Barriers to the Implementation of Digital Twins in the Process Industry: A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 85099750826}>, <Implementation of digital twins in the process industry: A systematic literature review of enablers and barriers, {eid: 85118569393}>, <Towards a Framework for the Classification of Digital Twins and their Applications, {eid: 85119073739}>, <The Role of AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data in Digital Twinning: A Systematic Literature Review, Challenges, and Opportunities, {eid: 85101961329}>, <Security issues in the Internet of Things (IoT): A comprehensive study, {eid: 85046619795}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <The Digital Twin Concept in Industry-A Review and Systematization, {eid: 85093358253}>, <Digital Twin in Industry: Stateof-the-Art, {eid: 85054374767}>, <Digital Twins: A Maturity Model for Their Classification and Evaluation, {eid: 85133780403}>, <Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85134599958}>, <Digital Twin in Services and Industrial Product Service Systems:: Review and Analysis, {eid: 85070547885}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-08-29,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85169698817

Ever since then, driven by remarkable industrial attention, digital twins flourished and ripened in several sectors. The notable industrial adoption has been sided by a growing interest from the software engineering community in general and the software architecture community in particular as demonstrated by the growing number of published peer-reviewed publications and proposed software architectural solutions for digital twins. In this paper, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic mapping study on architecting digital twins. The study captures crucial aspects of software architectures for digital twins as types of architectural solutions, quality attributes, and architectural patterns. It supports practitioners in creating digital twins tailored to their specific needs and researchers in identifying trends and open challenges. Starting from an initial set of potentially relevant 1630 peer-reviewed publications, we selected 140 primary studies. We analysed the set of primary studies using thorough data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. To compensate for single method limitations and reduce possible threats to conclusion validity, we discussed the results of our study with experts in the software architecture community. Based on our results, the field of software architecture for digital twins is lively and an increasing number of architectural solutions are being proposed. Although there is a lack of widely accepted reference architectural solutions for digital twins, most of them are built using a combination of the layered and service-oriented patterns and address maintainability, performance efficiency, and compatibility quality attributes.","Architectural patterns, Digital twin, Quality attributes, Software architectures",,,,,,,,"<Digital twin: Enabling

Reaching Net Zero depends on datafication and digitisation as data on carbon emissions collected across assets’ lifecycle are important for neutralising them. This study aims to understand how technological ecosystems such as Digital Twins – that connect physical and digital artefacts – can support a Net Zero vision in the built environment, in an industry-agnostic way to transfer any relevant lessons from other sectors. The method is a systematic literature review that structures new knowledge on the topic. The study showed that environment sustainability has been an overused idea in scientific literature, yet rarely operationalised. A scarcity of studies utilising the potential of digital twins for Net Zero was found. The emergent themes are: overreliance on technocratic solutions at the expense of systems thinking, proliferation of renewable sources and misunderstandings regarding visualisation necessity, and showing pathways for future DT system design for Net Zero.","Digital twins, model-based systems engineering, net zero, review, sustainability",,,,,,,,"<Shades of grey: Guidelines for working with the grey literature in systematic reviews for management and organizational studies, {eid: 84964407503}>, <Imagining construction’s digital future.

A digital twin is defined as the virtual representation of a physical asset that collects and sends real-time information. A digital twin collects data from the physical asset in real-time and uses this data to create a virtual model of the physical object. Its functionality depends on the bi-directional coordination of data between the physical and virtual models. This is likened to cyber-physical systems, which seek to provide bi-directional coordination between the physical and virtual worlds. While digital twins have found applications in the various industrial sectors such as aerospace, manufacturing, and industrial engineering, their applications in the construction industry are relatively limited. Although some level of progress has been made in the construction industry with the application of a digital twin, it still lags in other sectors. Virtual models of constructed facilities are developed and used to plan and construct the actual facility, with changes in the physical facility being automatically reflected in the virtual model based on real-time data and vice-versa. The digital twin shows promising possibilities in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility. This paper reviews the development and implementation of digital twin technology in the construction industry and compares its use with other industries while assessing the benefits of DT to the construction industry. A systematic literature review including a thematic analysis was employed to address the purpose of this study. Limitations associated with the existing and emerging applications are also identified. It concludes by highlighting the importance of DT applications in the construction sector.","Bi-directional, Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Analytics, Digital Twin, Real-Time, Virtual Model",,,,,,,,"<Semantic data management for the development and continuous reconfiguration of smart products and systems, {eid: 84969528916}>, <None, {eid: 85129240368}>, <Prioritizing object types for modeling existing industrial facilities, {eid: 85054099413}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Integration of BIM and the Physical Construction, Engineering, Construction, and Architectural Management: Special Issue on Advanced ICT and Smart Systems for Innovative Engineering, {eid: 84942110767}>, <Mechanisms for Bi-directional Coordination between Virtual Design and the Physical Construction, {eid: 85129249130}>, <An RTLS-based Approach to Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Design and Construction, {eid: 84872813621, doi: 10.1155/2012/596845}>, <Scenarios for Cyber-Physical Systems Integration in Construction, {eid: 84880055872}>, <Towards next-generation cyber-physical systems and digital twins for construction, {eid: 85112133397, doi: 10.36680/j.itcon.2021.027}>, <Thematic Analysis: A critical review of its process and evaluation, {eid: 84978175524}>, <Managing health care organizations: where professionalism meets complexity science, {eid: 0033995008}>, <Towards a Cyber-Physical Systems Approach to Construction, {eid: 77956305933}>, <Cyber-Physical Systems Development for Construction Applications, {eid: 85112129345, doi: 10.1007/s42524-020-0130-4}>, <None, {eid: 85112719218}>, <Computationally efficient analysis of SMA sensory particles embedded in complex aerostructures using a substructure approach, {eid: 84966658958}>, <Digital twin creates the blueprint for future smart buildings, {eid: 85129235765}>, <Patient flow modeling and performance analysis of healthcare delivery processes in hospitals: A review and reflections, {eid: 84912522613}>, <Next-generation digital twin, {eid: 85068757479}>, <None, {eid: 0003482307}>, <BIM-Based Progress Monitoring, {eid: 85063561288}>, <Built environment digital twinning, {eid: 85108350238}>, <Innovative Thinker -

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.","Artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain,

(AUID: 50160930700)",,Designing solutions with the product-service systems digital twin: What is now and what is next?,2022,Computers in Industry,,,,,,,39.0,10.1016/j.compind.2022.103629,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103629,"<Department of Mechanical Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology>",,"© 2022 The AuthorsDigital Twins (DT) are of particular interest in the domain of Product-Service Systems (PSS), to predict hardware availability, to inform about the needed features of new solutions, and to forecast the expected performances of new configurations in operation. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the extent to which ‘twins’ are applied today across the PSS life cycle, and to spotlight the ability of DT-related case studies to capture a full value perspective vs. simply attempting to represent hardware and services in the digital realm. By means of a systematic literature review combined with a mapping study, the paper reveals how only a minimal part of the existing literature is able to demonstrate how real-time physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-physical connections can be used to improve the design of servitized solutions. The analysis shows how contributions in the topic are mostly proposing frameworks and methods, as opposed to models and tools, as well as how ‘evaluation’, ‘validation’ tasks are largely neglected. As a result, the paper proposes a specialized definition of the PSS DT, together with a set of research questions that need to be answered to empower the engineering teams with relevant DT for PSS design.","Digital twin, Product-service systems, Systematic mapping, Systematic review",,,,,,,,"<Systematization of virtual product twin models in the context of smart product reconfiguration during

They are virtual reflections of physical world entities, of objects and phenomena, and are rapidly becoming an asset for innovation. There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs' potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.","Artificial intelligence, Data, Datafication, Digital model, Digital shadow, Digital twin, Intelligent technologies, Machine learning",,,,,,,,"<Leaders wanted: Experts at change at a moment of truth.

As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion. From this, Digital Twin (DT), one of the main enabling technologies in Industry 4.0, has been identified to have the great potential in solving these challenges. DT sheds light on the real fusion of the cyber world and the physical world, and it has the potential to be used as a technology to help people build virtulized system with high-fidelity, hence greatly lower bar on the cybersecurity research of the cyber physical system and create other DT based cybersecurity applications.","CPS, cybersecurity, Digital Twin, emulation, ICS, SCADA,

The virtualization of buildings and bridges in the last 15 years in the form of Building or Bridge Information Models is clearly identified as the starting point for the DTs. The industry has erected a frame with semantically rich 3D reference models that are now heavily enriched with visual sensor data captured on construction sites. This article provides an overview of the research and current practices of computer vision methods in the construction industry and presents typical examples of their applications for 3D reconstruction, safety management and structural monitoring for quality assurance. It then highlights the dominant achievements presented in the literature and concludes with the challenges and research directions applicable to digital twins that need to be addressed and exploited

Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) promises significant improvements for the manufacturing industry by facilitating the integration of manufacturing systems by Digital Twins. However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.","Digital shadows, Industrial internet of things, Internet of production, World wide lab",,,,,,,,"<Deploying fog computing in industrial internet of things and industry 4. 0, {eid: 85049803971}>, <Peeking inside the black-box: A survey on explainable artificial intelligence, {eid: 85053352477}>, <A framework for explainable concept drift detection in process mining, {eid: 85115178805}>, <Explainable artificial intelligence: Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, {eid: 85077515399}>, <Blockchain-based privacy preservation for supply chains supporting lightweight multi-hop information accountability, {eid: 85100453781}>, <Ironies of automation, {eid: 0020843464}>, <The Physical Internet, {eid: 84923153575}>, <A survey on digital twin: Definitions, characteristics, applications, and design implications, {eid: 85076680404}>, <The ironies of automation: Still going strong at 30?, {eid: 84875427820}>, <A conceptual model for digital shadows in industry and its application, {eid: 85118142665}>, <Edge cloud as an enabler for distributed AI in industrial IoT applications: The experience of the IoTwins project, {eid: 85075928612}>, <None, {eid: 85054023050}>, <Model-driven development of a digital twin for injection molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <How context and design shape human-robot trust and attributions, {eid: 85097184876}>, <A digital twin for production planning based on cyber-physical systems: A case study for a cyber-physical system-based creation of a digital twin, {eid: 85065427421}>, <Domain-specific language for sensors in the internet of production, {eid: 85165962517}>, <None, {eid: 84995466560}>, <The road to european digital sovereignty with gaia-x and IDSA, {eid: 85103448059}>, <What happens when decision support systems fail?-The importance of usability on performance in erroneous systems, {eid: 85062364168}>, <None, {eid: 80054884442}>, <Towards a continuously improving composites manufacturing by employing the internet of production, {eid: 85124263660}>, <Process prediction with digital twins, {eid: 85121810059}>, <Challenges in automotive software engineering, {eid: 34247127701}>, <Digital twins in health care: Ethical implications of an emerging engineering paradigm, {eid: 85042098524}>, <Holarchy for line-less mobile assembly systems operation in the context of the internet of production, {eid: 85106412122}>, <None, {eid: 84946229140}>, <Modeling language variability with reusable language components, {eid: 85055591621}>, <A compositional framework for systematic modeling language reuse, {eid: 85096955321}>, <Reducing complexity with simplicity-usability methods for industry 4. 0, {eid: 84986543578}>, <None, {eid: 85127453330}>, <Towards low latency industrial robot control in programmable data planes, {eid: 85091982375}>, <Goal-oriented modelling of relations and dependencies in data marketplaces, {eid: 85049320311}>, <Concern-oriented language development: Fostering reuse in language engineering, {eid: 85048276792}>, <None, {eid: 85112723943}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <Industry 4. 0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <None, {eid: 0003939293}>, <Easing the conscience with OPC UA: An internet-wide study on insecure deployments, {eid: 85097285990}>, <Missed opportunities: Measuring the untapped TLS support in the industrial Internet of Things, {eid: 85133169932}>, <Transparent end-to-end security for publish/subscribe communication in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85107432740}>, <Towards sustainable systems engineering-integrating tools via component and connector architectures, {eid: 85127185370}>, <Model-driven systems engineering for virtual product design, {eid: 85075936044}>, <Towards a modeldriven architecture for interactive digital twin cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <Hybrid intelligence, {eid: 85069455009}>, <What does explainable AI really mean?

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.","Cloud robotics, Industry 40, model-driven, reference

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V's challenges and envisions IoTBD as ""Big Data 2.0.""Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.","big data 2.0, cloud computing in IoT, cloud IoT services, IoT big data, IoT big data survey, ""Vs challenges for IoT

24,,Zhao L. (AUID: 56355436400),,Event Prediction in the Big Data Era: A Systematic Survey,2021,ACM Computing Surveys,,,,,,,62.0,10.1145/3450287,https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3450287,<Emory University>,,"© 2021 ACM.Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.","artificial intelligence, big data, Event prediction",,,,,,,,"<Forecasting of solar power ramp events: A post-processing approach, {eid:

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.","CPS, model-driven design, system-performance engineering",,,,,,,,"<Total productive maintenance: Literature review and directions, {eid: 49149086860}>, <An empirical survey-based study into industry practice in real-time systems, {eid: 85101615395}>, <A framework for scheduler synthesis, {eid: 0033337591}>, <Uppaal 4.0, {eid: 36148931085}>, <A markovian decision process, {eid: 0001700171}>, <Decision support methodology for evolutionary embedded system design, {eid: 85081093306}>, <None, {eid: 49049085902}>, <On methods and tools for rigorous system design, {eid: 85108822937}>, <None, {eid: 85034418483}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Model-based diagnosis for cyber-physical production systems based on machine learning and residual-based diagnosis models, {eid: 85074197869}>, <None, {eid: 85104646994}>, <None, {eid: 85087734433}>, <None, {eid: 0003962322}>, <The concept of reference architectures, {eid: 74549119498}>, <Dynamic modeling of the tradeoff between productivity and safety in critical engineering systems, {eid: 4344630824}>, <None, {eid: 85117476516}>, <Max-plus algebra and max-plus linear discrete-event systems: An introduction, {eid: 53149111136}>, <Modeling cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84155172767}>, <Knowledge-driven versus data-driven logics, {eid: 0037652855}>, <Model-driven performance prediction of systems of systems, {eid: 84979255879}>, <Mining traces of embedded software systems for insights, {eid: 85117442497}>, <None, {eid: 0003506085}>, <The relationship of system engineering to the project cycle, {eid: 1842637817}>, <None, {eid: 51749119047}>, <On the systematic use of budget-based design, {eid: 84878789010}>, <None, {eid: 85107187033}>, <Performance guarantees for scheduling algorithms, {eid: 0017925568}>, <Methods for evaluating and covering the design space during early design development, {eid: 9644281035}>, <Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems, {eid: 0023365727}>, <None, {eid: 84880914293}>, <Value and benefits of model-based systems engineering (mbse): Evidence from the literature, {eid: 85098450048}>, <A blueprint for system-level performance modeling of software-intensive embedded systems, {eid: 85027957685}>, <Checking metric temporal logic with trace, {eid: 85014968068}>, <Interface modeling for quality and resource management, {eid: 85198830744}>, <Performance engineering for industrial embedded data-processing systems, {eid: 84952333153}>, <None, {eid: 77953762003}>, <None, {eid: 84969745906}>, <None, {eid: 0003454649}>, <An approach for quantitative analysis of application-specific dataflow architectures, {eid: 0030679033}>, <Y-chart based system design: A discussion on approaches, {eid: 80055022911}>, <A brief account of runtime verification, {eid: 67349182373}>, <Model-based engineering in the embedded systems domain: An industrial survey on the state-of-practice, {eid: 84962207101}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <A survey of timing verification techniques for multi-core real-time systems, {eid: 85068038532}>, <Modelplex: Verified runtime validation of verified cyber-physical system models, {eid: 84994027707}>, <Simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems: State of the art and new trends, {eid: 85068546250}>, <Software passports for automated performance anomaly detection of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85071500236}>, <Calibration error bound estimation in performance modeling, {eid: 84890087572}>, <Exploring exploration: A tutorial introduction to embedded systems design space exploration, {eid: 85010008204}>, <Calibration of abstract performance models for system-level design space exploration, {eid: 46349106914}>, <None, {eid: 84892234592}>, <Online scheduling, {eid: 85035344127}>, <Driven by data or derived through physics?

The literature review presented describes the current trends in systems management as a means for continuous improvement, rather than as an exercise in oversimplification of systems through reductionist strategies. This conceptualisation of holistic management of organisations is opening up pathways for best practice and emerging trends, such as through methods focused on the explicit, such as for reducing risk and increasing efficiency via model-based or simulation-based engineering, and the Digital Twin. But also through methods focused on the tacit, such as through shedding of paradigms that serve as barriers to systems management through adaptive management, standardisation of outcomes, integration structures and integrated ideation of system congruence are being used for improving results. A literature review and presentation of four case studies are provided make the case for the need and effect of managing system complexity for better results. These trends in systems thought leadership and practices in systemology open up organisational capacity to engage in enriched systems management.","continuous improvement, lean, system complexity, systems management",,,,,,,,"<Transforming the systems movement, {eid: 79251558040}>, <Complexity and consequence: Crowdsourcing project., {eid: 83455220052}>, <None, {eid: 85082562778}>, <None, {eid: 0003951439}>, <Foreword, {eid: 85079526702}>, <None, {eid: 33645653200}>, <Sense-making between and across stakeholder perspectives, {eid: 85082562275}>, <None, {eid: 0003793638}>, <None, {eid: 0003964033}>, <None, {eid: 84976576846}>, <None, {eid: 0004135008}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85016450943}>, <None, {eid: 0004154995}>, <Designer system of systems: A rational integrated approach of system engineering to tailored aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, aero-viscoelasticity, stability, control, geometry, materials, structures, propulsion, performance, sizing, weight, cost, {eid: 85044598861}>, <None, {eid: 84942294896}>, <None, {eid: 85075688076}>, <None, {eid: 9144256009}>, <On the perception of complexity and its implications, {eid: 85006365139}>, <MBE: Advancing engineering test and evaluation, {eid: 85082562979}>, <Preface, {eid: 85082562700}>, <None, {eid: 67650158783}>, <None, {eid: 85082562794}>, <None, {eid: 84897635923}>, <None, {eid: 85028753348}>, <None, {eid: 0003431346}>, <None, {eid: 0003894008}>, <None, {eid: 85082563125}>, <None, {eid: 0004224516}>, <None, {eid: 85082563042}>",,,Routledge,,,2020-04-02,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85041799688

An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.","Barrier, Digital Twin, Enabler, Literature Review, Process Industry, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<Industrie 4. 0 by siemens, {eid: 85042916761, doi: 10.4018/JCIT.2018040103}>, <Review of digital twin about concepts, technologies, and industrial applications, {eid: 85087693875, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.06.017}>, <Digital twin: Enabling technologies, challenges and open research, {eid: 85087331367, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358}>, <Scanning the industry 4. 0: A literature review on technologies for manufacturing systems, {eid: 85060756114, doi: 10.1016/j.jestch.2019.01.006}>, <Digital twin: Values, challenges and enablers from a modeling perspective, {eid: 85081090770, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970143}>, <None, {eid: 85068694049, doi: 10.17863/CAM.32260}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <Gartners top 10 strategic technology trends for 2017, {eid: 84983461822}>, <Leading the iot, {eid: 85099752626}>, <None, {eid: 85063592039}>, <Evolution of a digital twin for a steam cracker, {eid: 85074192535}>, <Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants, {eid: 85071133800, doi: 10.1039/c9re00017h}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167, doi: 10.1016/j.promfg.2017.04.043}>, <Conducting content-analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management, {eid: 84865137089, doi: 10.1108/13598541211258609}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-12-14,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099750826

Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem.

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.","Battery System, Control Middleware, Digital Twin, IoT, Self-Discharge",,,,,,,,"<Design and development of a cloud based cyber-physical architecture for the internet-of-things, {eid: 84969627262}>, <The modelling and operations for the digital twin in the context of manufacturing, {eid: 85071860577}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <None, {eid: 85086454786}>, <Modeling the self-discharge by voltage decay of a nmc/ graphite lithium-ion cell, {eid: 85050295357}>, <Defining a digital twin-based cyber-physical production system for autonomous manufacturing in smart shop floors, {eid: 85060183300}>, <None, {eid: 85051065243}>, <Modeling of cloud-based digital twins for smart manufacturing with mt connect, {eid: 85052894576}>, <Cyber-physical systems design for electric vehicles, {eid: 84872981461}>, <Architecture of a digital twin for enabling digital services for battery systems, {eid: 85070853718}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Mqtt-v3. 1. 1-specification, {eid: 85086429855}>, <None, {eid: 85055589247}>, <From simulation to experimentable digital twins, {eid: 85006371785}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-09-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123040661

All rights reserved.A digital twin is a virtual representation of a system containing all information available on site. This paper presents condition monitoring of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition monitoring, data-based schemes and model-based approaches, and the digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model-based approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical-based model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages, disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a drivetrain it is found that multi-body simulation is advised for the creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy, however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro-Ro (roll onroll off) vessels. The vessels in the case study are managed by Wilhelmsen Ship Management and a discussion of the implementation of digital twins in this sector is comprised in this article.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Continuous maintenance and the future foundations and technological challenges, {eid: 84978488604}>, <None, {eid: 85069484062}>, <The digital twin paradigm for future nasa and u.s.

Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture-the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.","cyber-physical system, digital twin, reference framework",,,,,,,,"<Current status and advancement of cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84928606583}>, <Cyber physical systems in the context of industry 4.0, {eid: 84905844055}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <A survey of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84555177840}>, <Reference architecture and maturity levels for cyber-physical systems in the mechanical engineering industry, {eid: 85006380430}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <C2ps: A digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85015767302}>, <Digital twin data modeling with automationml and a communication methodology for data exchange, {eid: 85006391498}>, <The role of the industry 4.0 asset administration shell and the digital twin during the life cycle of a plant, {eid: 85044475829}>, <Digital twin-based smart production management and control framework for the complex product assembly shop-floor, {eid: 85041548794}>, <Digital twin-driven product design framework, {eid: 85061021953}>, <The digital twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4.0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>, <Procedures for performing systematic reviews, {eid: 27644567603}>, <Qualitative data analysis for applied policy research, {eid: 0001457476}>, <None, {eid: 0037941821}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762}>, <Equipment energy consumption management in digital twin shop-floor: A framework and potential applications, {eid: 85048222217}>, <Dynamic resource allocation optimization for digital twin-driven smart shopfloor, {eid: 85048229043}>, <Data-centric middleware based digital twin platform for dependable cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85028079218}>, <A digital twin-based multimodal ui adaptation framework for assistance systems in industry 4.0, {eid: 85069873204}>, <Digital twin-proof of concept, {eid: 85044953148}>, <The role of data fusion in predictive maintenance using digital twin, {eid: 85046491768}>, <Digital twin driven prognostics and health management for complex equipment, {eid: 85047291024}>, <Visualising the digital twin using web services and augmented reality, {eid: 85012932205}>, <The digital twin: Demonstrating the potential of real time data acquisition in production systems, {eid: 85020876167}>, <The digital twin: Realizing the cyber-physical production system for industry 4.0, {eid: 85019987476}>, <A review of the roles of digital twin in cps-based production systems, {eid: 85029833606}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-05-28,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85072842816

Intelligent Reflecting surface (IRS) have emerged as a key technology capable of intelligently reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, thereby enhancing overall network performance. Traditional optimization techniques face limitations in meeting the stringent performance requirements of 6G networks due to the intricate and dynamic nature of the wireless environment. Consequently, deep learning (DL) techniques are employed within the IRS framework to optimize wireless system performance.
