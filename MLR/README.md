This folder collects **all artefacts** created during the MLR:

| ----------------- | ------- |
| `MLR Protocol.xlsx` | MLR protocol: search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, snowballing rules. |
| `Data-Extraction/` | Raw &amp; curated Data-Extraction Forms (DEFs) for both **peer-reviewed** and **grey** sources. |
| `Data-Analysis-SPx/` | Step-wise analysis output (<code>SPx</code> = “selected-papers experiments”): filtering stages, coding, statistics, plots. |
| `Tools/` | Tool taxonomy and mapping spreadsheets used to build Table 4 of the paper. |

Each sub-directory has its own README with extra details and reproduction hints.
