# Replication Package for the paper "Barriers and Enablers for Traceability and Federation in Model-Based Digital Twin Engineering"

This repository accompanies the paper “**Barriers and Enablers for Traceability and Federation in Model-Based Digital-Twin Engineering**”, submitted to the "
Information and Software Technology" Journal, special issue on "Model- and Data-driven Digital Twins".
 
It contains every artefact needed to reproduce the **Multi-Vocal Literature Review (MLR)**, the **industry survey**, and all data-analysis pipelines.
